<h3>About the Course</h3>
<p>This is the first semester in a two-semester introductory course
focused on current theories of structure and mechanism in organic
chemistry, their historical development, and their basis in
experimental observation. The course is open to freshmen with
excellent preparation in chemistry and physics, and it aims to
develop both taste for original science and intellectual skills
necessary for creative research. <a href="/chemistry/freshman-organic-chemistry/content/class-sessions"> view class sessions &gt;&gt;</a></p>
<h4>Course Structure:</h4>
<p>This Yale College course, taught on campus three times per week for 50 minutes, was recorded for Open Yale Courses in Fall 2008.</p>
