<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>Okay.
Wow. So this is my last true confession to you, my class, and it&#39;s a true -- I
always give you true confessions. I never lie to you, my class, but this is a
truly true confession because the fact of the matter is, I actually really
couldn&#39;t figure out how to end the course. [laughs] I couldn&#39;t figure out what
this last lecture was supposed to be, and I really wondered about it, agonized
over it. It&#39;s the last lecture. There&#39;s all this pressure. Several of you have
e-mailed me and said, &quot;Looking forward to the last lecture.&quot; [laughs]
How can I live up to the expectation? </p>
<p>So I decided that I
would do two things in the lecture, and the first thing that I&#39;m going to do is
talk about the end of the American Revolution, which is not an easy thing to
do, and I&#39;m not going to be so good as to actually put my finger on the moment
when the Revolution ends, but I&#39;m at least going to suggest a couple things
about that. And then at the end you&#39;ll see I&#39;m going to come back around and
hopefully magically just tie the whole course together by the end of the
lecture. You will for sure notice that some of the things I&#39;m talking about now
have references to things I talked about way at the beginning of the course. So
I&#39;m trying for symmetry -- course symmetry. </p>
<p>And if you think back
in the distant ages of time when this course started I talked on that first -- I
think the very first lecture -- I did -- I used a quote from John Adams and I
used a quote from Benjamin Rush. Those are the quotes that are on the top of
the syllabus. And both of them talk about when the Revolution supposedly began.
So Adams, writing in 1815, said that he thought the Revolution began &quot;in
the Minds of the People, and this was effected, from 1760 to 1775, in the
course of fifteen Years before a drop of blood was drawn at Lexington.&quot; So
he says the war, quote, &quot;was no part of the Revolution.&quot; And then the
other quote I read was Rush, who in 1776 basically agreed that the war and the Revolution
were two different things but then says, &quot;The American War is over: but
this is far from being the case with the American Revolution.&quot; &quot;We
have changed our forms of government, but it remains to effect a revolution in
our principles, opinions, and manners, so as to accommodate them to the forms
of government we have adopted.&quot; </p>
<p>Okay. So when I
quoted those at the very beginning of the course, I basically was quoting them
to kind of shake up your assumptions about what the American Revolution
actually was. If the Founders can&#39;t even agree, that kind of opens things
broadly for us to really talk about what the Revolution was. Today I&#39;m
mentioning them because I actually do want us to think a little bit about, if
that -- if there&#39;s all that confusion about when it starts, what can we say
about when a Revolution ends? </p>
<p>And there&#39;s
definitely a hint about how to discuss that question in both of those quotes,
even though they don&#39;t necessarily agree, because both men in one way or
another saw the revolution as being fundamentally about what Rush called &quot;principles,
opinions and manners&quot; and Adams called a &quot;change in the minds of the
people.&quot; So in a way they&#39;re both saying that a real Revolution, a full
revolution, involves some kind of a fundamental change in principles. And, as
both men suggest, obviously this isn&#39;t something that happens instantly like a
declaration of war or a surrender on a battlefield, that it&#39;s a process and it
takes place over years, maybe even over decades. </p>
<p>Now obviously if you
think about what a revolution is, formally speaking, it&#39;s a change of forms of
government more than anything else. So it involves some kind of a large-scale
transfer of power after some kind of a struggle between competing groups. Right?
So it&#39;s a major shift in sovereignty of some kind. But for the struggle and
the instability of the Revolution to come to a close, obviously there had to be
some kind of a shared agreement about the nature of whatever this new regime
was going to be, about what its ideals were, about what its shape was going to
be. And without that kind of shared agreement on those kinds of things, this
new regime would really stay in a state of flux and would be vulnerable to all
kinds of continued dramatic and potentially revolutionary change. So in a sense,
what I&#39;m saying here is that revolutions involve both deconstruction and
reconstruction, and that basically it&#39;s one thing to rebel against something,
and it&#39;s quite another thing to construct something in its place that manages
to get some kind of general acceptance. And a revolution can&#39;t be said to have
ended until both parts of that equation have been met. </p>
<p>And I think if you
think back over the course of the semester, you can see that during the
semester we&#39;ve looked at both parts of that equation, in a sense. We&#39;ve looked,
at the very beginning of the course when we were getting toward the beginning
of the war, we&#39;ve seen how Americans generally agreed about what they
protesting against, but the 1770s, 1780s, 1790s revealed they weren&#39;t
necessarily in agreement about what they were fighting for; they didn&#39;t
necessarily agree about what the most desirable outcome would be. And we&#39;ve
watched this over the course of the semester. We&#39;ve seen people basically just figuring
out what this new regime is going to be. So, we looked at the 1770s, we saw how
people tried to create constitutions that would reflect whatever this new
regime was going to be, and we saw how those constitutions pretty much
distrusted centralized power. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the
1780s revealed that that first wave of reform wasn&#39;t quite right, that there
were some pretty important problems that weren&#39;t solved, that there were some
new problems that seemed to be erupting that maybe hadn&#39;t been anticipated
before, and then we&#39;ve seen the result. We&#39;ve watched Continental Army officers
sort of vaguely threatening some kind of coup and saw the mighty power of
George Washington&#39;s glasses. We saw soldiers sticking their bayonets through
the windows of the Pennsylvania state house to demand their pay from the
Confederation Congress. We saw indebted farmers in Massachusetts joining in
protest to close down the courts, and then of course we saw the Independent
Republic of Vermont and my favorite, the State of Franklin. </p>
<p>So clearly there was
some pretty widespread discontent, and some of the elite also, as we heard,
were not particularly happy. Many of them wanted some kind of economic
stability. Some of them were none too pleased about what they saw as this sort
of widespread social instability. So in one way or another, all of these groups
felt that the promise of the Revolution wasn&#39;t really being fulfilled, and the
political system that had been put into place during the Revolution not only
was incapable of dealing with the problem, but in many ways it was fueling the
problem. </p>
<p>Now of course
everything in one way or another added up to lead to the Constitutional
Convention, which we discussed. And as we discussed in the course, a new Constitution
was by no means a done deal, and in fact there was some pretty fervent debate
over whether or not some individual states even wanted to participate in the
whole Convention at all. And we&#39;ve seen some of what people were scared of in
those debates about whether or not to go to the Convention. A stronger
government or even just a new government might open the door to things like an
established aristocracy, monarchy, tyrannical centralized power, the rise of a
privileged few over an impoverished many. </p>
<p>So in essence, these
people are seeing that there might be a big change happening, they don&#39;t know
what the change is going to be, and anything seems possible, and all of those
things obviously would represent going back on what the Revolution had just
gone forth for. So in essence, you see people who had absolutely no sense of
political stability or permanence, no sense of what was going to come, no real
consensus about the best way to fix things. </p>
<p>Now following the
1780s came a period that obviously we don&#39;t cover in this course. My other
lecture course covers it, and that&#39;s the 1790s, which saw yet another wave of
reform and this time it has to do with the rise of the Federalist party. And
the Federalists in one way or another were largely about centralizing power
even more, and strengthening the national government even more, and controlling
and channeling the protests and politicking of the populace; they&#39;re not all
that comfortable with ongoing popular politicking. </p>
<p>And here again, in
the 1790s with this sort of counter-wave, you also see more instability, more
of a sense that there&#39;s some kind of potentially drastic change that might be
happening just around the corner. So throughout the 1790s, people have things
in their letters, throwaway lines like: &#39;If this government lasts another five
years, here&#39;s what I think we should do.&#39; You can almost feel in some of these
letters how frightened, in a sense, some of these people were who were stepping
onto the stage of a new government in this sense of amazing instability. </p>
<p>I&#39;m going to offer
three quotes because it&#39;s amazing to me how similar they are. They all use the
same image. It&#39;s almost like they went into a room and said, &#39;How shall we
describe being scared in 1789? Oh, I know.&#39; So James Madison says in 1789,
&quot;[W]e are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us.&quot;
George Washington in 1790: &quot;I walk on untrodden ground.&quot; And good
old Pennsylvania senator William Maclay, who offered us that quote way at the
beginning of the course, sitting next to Virginians at dinner and saying that
all they talked about was alcohol and horses. Maclay says, &quot;The whole
world is a shell, and we tread on hollow ground every step.&quot; Now that&#39;s
kind of interesting to me, that all of those quotes are all saying the same
thing, which is basically all of these guys literally are saying, &#39;Wow. I&#39;m on
this really unstable ground and I have no idea where I&#39;m supposed to be going
or what a safe path is going to be.&#39; So throughout the 1790s, the Federalists
countered their sense of social disorder by trying to legislate and
administrate their way into order and control. And the Alien and Sedition Acts
of 1798, which I&#39;m sure you probably studied in high school, are two of the
most extreme examples along those lines. </p>
<p>This brings us to
Thomas Jefferson and the presidential election of 1800. Now significantly, for
the purposes of this class, Jefferson years later, very modestly called his own
election to the Presidency, quote, &quot;the Revolution of 1800.&quot; Right,
not modest at all: &#39;ah, yes, when I came to power it was the Revolution of 1800.&#39;
And not only that -- he said it was &quot;as real a revolution in the
principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form.&quot; Okay. He&#39;s
talking serious revolution; &#39;my rise to power was just as significant as 1776.&#39;
Thank you, Thomas Jefferson. But you can kind of see that, given what was
happening in the 1790s -- in my amazingly quick and dirty, frighteningly
condensed version of the 1790s that I just gave you -- given what the
Federalists seemed to represent, you could see why Jefferson would have thought
that his rise to the Presidency was some kind of a return to core principles,
or Revolutionary principles. </p>
<p>Now this change of
principles wasn&#39;t easy, and actually I think it was the whole intensity of the experience
of that 1800 election that led Jefferson to experience and describe his
election as a revolution that was fought and won. His rise to the Presidency
came after a seemingly deadlocked tie vote in the Electoral College that was
thrown into the House of Representatives to decide. So deadlocked was the
election and so extreme were the fears and expectations on all sides that if
the wrong person got the office, the entire nation would come crashing to ruin,
that two states -- in two different states -- and in one state I believe the
governor was in on it -- people were stockpiling arms because they were going
to march on Washington and take the government for Jefferson. That&#39;s amazing.
That&#39;s America, in a sense, on the brink of some sort of civil war -- if the
people are marching on the government to take it for the person who they think
should be President. </p>
<p>Massachusetts
Federalist Fisher Ames, at that time, thought about this and believed that he
understood why this was happening. And I&#39;ll mention here only because it&#39;s been
a continuing theme in our course: we&#39;ve seen lots of crying guys over the
semester. Washington&#39;s really good at reducing people to tears apparently. And
I have to mention here -- partly because I just really like Fisher Ames, because
he&#39;s sort of an intriguing character who always says quotable things. But he
also -- he was in Congress in the 1790s and the thing that he&#39;s most known for
is he made a speech about the Jay Treaty and everybody started to cry. So he
reduced Congress to tears, which to me is kind of a terrifying image, Congress
crying. </p>
<p>So Fisher Ames,
mighty orator, reducer to tears. Here&#39;s what he says in 1800, when he&#39;s looking
around and he&#39;s trying to figure out what this all means. </p>
<p>&quot;The fact really
is, that ... there is a want of accordance between our system [of government]
and the state of our public opinion. The government is republican; opinion is
essentially democratic. ... Either, events will raise public opinion high
enough to support our government, or public opinion will pull down the
government to its own level. They must equalize.&quot; </p>
<p>That&#39;s really
interesting. So here, watching what&#39;s happening in 1800, Ames is kind of
confirming what Adams and Rush were suggesting in the quotes that I started out
by discussing. For a revolution to end, forms and public opinion have to
equalize in some way, and before they do, things remain unstable. </p>
<p>So in a way, what all
of these guys are saying, is that revolutions end when public opinion conforms
with new post-revolutionary forms of governance, and until that happens,
revolutionary change is still entirely possible. Once that happens, once the
sort of new car smell has dissipated from a new government and the government
can be taken for granted as kind of the normal state of affairs and it&#39;s
endorsed by a majority, then it becomes much harder to stage some kind of
full-scale revolution from outside of the government. So in essence,
revolutions end when the public mind declares that they do; it&#39;s up to the
public. </p>
<p>Now that&#39;s a nice,
big, broad general discussion about defining the bounds of the American
Revolution, but what does that really mean? What are we really saying here and
how could we show it? How do you actually show public opinion changing and
eventually conforming with a new government? Well, one way that you can begin
to do this is to find a wonderful primary source that includes all kinds of
eyewitness testimony about one person&#39;s ideas and how they changed over time. </p>
<p>So I bring to you
today the recorded recollections of George Robert Twelves Hughes, a New England
shoemaker. I know he&#39;s popped up once or twice in one or two of the books we&#39;ve
read. And he&#39;s popped up once or twice for good reason, because it&#39;s hard -- it&#39;s
harder to find comments from people who are not lofty Founders. It&#39;s hard to
find recollections and memories and thoughts about the Revolution in a broad
sense from average Americans because, number one, they don&#39;t spend a lot of
time often sitting down and musing on paper, and number two, their papers don&#39;t
get saved as often as an elite politician&#39;s papers get saved. </p>
<p>So people always
quote George Robert Twelves Hughes because he&#39;s there and he&#39;s thoughtful and
he actually went back and talked about his entire life, and his life spans this
entire period. He was born in 1742. He dies in 1840, so he lives a really long
time. And he ended up being one of the last surviving veterans of the Revolution,
or at least that people knew about. So because of that, in the 1830s, he was
interviewed so that he could talk about his recollections, things of his life
that he saw as being significant. </p>
<p>So let&#39;s look for a
minute at what Hughes can show us. For one thing, you can see in some of the
stories that he told and the way that he tells them some kind of subtle but
actually pretty significant changes in the public mind that were unleashed by
the Revolution. So for example, one of Hughes&#39;s earliest memories was of having
to bring a pair of shoes to John Hancock. And as he recalled the occasion all these
years later, he was terrified, and he says he&#39;s first ushered into the kitchen
where his type of person belongs -- and then Hancock says, &#39;No, no. Actually,
I&#39;d like to thank this guy personally,&#39; so then he&#39;s ushered into the sitting
room, and he mumbles a little speech. He didn&#39;t quite know what he was supposed
to say or how to say it, and he&#39;s really embarrassed, and then Hancock actually
asked him to sit down, which terrifies him even more. And then worst of all,
Hancock says, &#39;Let me drink to your health&#39; -- and wants to do the whole
glass-clinking thing, and Hughes said, &#39;I&#39;ve never done the glass-clinking
thing. [laughs] I didn&#39;t know what I was doing. We did the glass-clinking
thing.&#39; And then he basically ran away as soon as he could without being rude.
</p>
<p>Now, Hughes&#39;s memory
of this whole episode, even all of these years later, shows really sort of
colonial era deference at work. Right? This is not someone who&#39;s just
respectful of John Hancock. This is someone who&#39;s scared of interacting with someone
who&#39;s that above him in society. </p>
<p>Now Hughes lived in
Boston in the 1760s and 1770s. This is very handy for us obviously, because
then he offers us eyewitness testimony about other kinds of sort of
floating-in-the-air opinions that were developing at the time. So he -- certainly,
you can see when he&#39;s talking about his experiences -- shared the feelings of
many of his neighbors in Boston in the 1770s. In his later years, he remembered
how much he really hated the British soldiers that were occupying Boston. He
actually remembered that one of them had a pair of shoes made and then never
paid for them, so it&#39;s a really specific I-hate-the-British memory. He also
remembers watching an eighteenth-century mugging in which a soldier knocked a
lady down and stole her bonnet and stole her muff. So he remembers
ugly-British-soldier moments from Boston. </p>
<p>And then on March 5,
he says that when he heard noise in the street he ran to see what was happening,
and he saw British soldiers firing on American civilians, and his response
really says something, because he immediately ran home to arm himself. He
grabbed a cane and he ran back to the uproar, and when a soldier tried to grab
the cane out of his hands, Hughes insisted that he had a right to carry
whatever he pleased. </p>
<p>Now that&#39;s really
interesting, because here you see Hughes -- He&#39;s defending his fellow
Bostonians literally and physically, and he&#39;s clearly -- I suppose in insisting
that he has a right to hold on to that cane -- defending his rights too. But
what you see is that he&#39;s taken action almost instinctively. It&#39;s not like he
saw what was happening and said, &#39;This is a Revolutionary moment. I must go
home and grab my club so that I can say I was there at the beginning phases of
the American Revolution.&#39; He just sees what&#39;s happening in the street, he&#39;s
upset, it&#39;s his neighbors, it&#39;s people from Boston who are getting shot at, and
he instinctively is just drawn in to what&#39;s happening. So clearly, his sense of
involvement in unfolding events is growing, particularly given that he next
took part in the Boston Tea Party. Obviously, that&#39;s a very deliberate choice
to take part in a protest. And then he fights as a soldier during the Revolution,
which I guess is the ultimate way in which you show that you&#39;re part of a cause.
And then he went back to being a shoemaker, and then he became an aged veteran
of the Revolution. </p>
<p>Oh -- and one thing I
can&#39;t help mentioning, only because whenever I talk about George Robert Twelves
Hughes I always mention this, because I just love the fact that it exists: He
had, I think -- Well, actually I know, he had fifteen children. But what&#39;s
wonderful about that fact is that his eleventh son was named Eleven [laughter]
and his fifteenth<sup> </sup>son was named Fifteen [laughs] and I just love the
guy. George Robert Twelves Hughes has the humor. I don&#39;t know if his sons were
really thrilled about being named Eleven and Fifteen, [laughter] but I just
love the fact that he did that and that we know that. That makes me even
happier. </p>
<p>Okay. So what does
Hughes show us besides very bizarre naming habits? For one thing, his
recollections offer a great example of the ways in which the Revolution
inspired average Americans to become politically active. He was literally drawn
into the action, first defending his neighbors and his town, but over time
obviously feeling like he was taking part in some kind of a larger cause. So in
essence, he helps us see how the Revolution could politicize someone. And you
kind of see this in action. </p>
<p>Obviously, with the
Hancock story, you can see what a real sense of pre-revolutionary deference
felt like. Now of course, the Revolution didn&#39;t just stamp out deference, but a
politicized public was a public that understood that it had rights and that it
could demand them. And eventually, the American people would not show that kind
of fear and trembling before a member of the supposed elite, so basically,
eventually the American public would find their voice. And this idea that the
public had a voice and had a right to express it is the sort of general
changing of public opinion that would ultimately connect to the nation&#39;s new
form of government. So basically, you see the sort of beginning of a chain
reaction that might actually lead to the end of the Revolution. You can see
patterns unfolding that represent pretty major changes over a long stretch of
time. </p>
<p>Now obviously, it&#39;s
not just average American citizens who are being shaped by the Revolution. The
elite were profoundly affected by it as well. And for one obvious thing -- suddenly,
they were presented with this opportunity to create and shape a new government
for a new nation, and they knew that this was a pretty rare opportunity. So
even as they&#39;re doing it, they know that this is not something that happens
very often. Just listen to how John Adams discussed what he felt like was the
change that he experienced over the course of his life. And this is in one of
the letters -- I mentioned this at the beginning of the course -- these great
letters they write to each other in their old age. So here, writing to
Jefferson, Adams says, </p>
<p>&quot;When I was
young, the Summum Bonum [or the sort of ultimate height] in Massachusetts, was
to be worth ten thousand pounds Sterling, ride in a Chariot [a carriage], be Colonel
of a Regiment of Militia and hold a seat in His Majesty&#39;s Council. No Mans Imagination
aspired to any thing higher beneath the Skies.&quot; </p>
<p>So Adams is thinking
back, and he&#39;s here basically suggesting that the Revolution and its aftermath
expanded the horizons of an entire generation. Now, he&#39;s talking about the
elite, but you could expand this to include the American citizenry as well, because
in a variety of ways the Revolution shook things up, and in doing so it
expanded people&#39;s horizons. </p>
<p>Now I use the word
&quot;citizenry&quot; -- and I did that really deliberately, because all
Americans did not have their horizons expanded during the Revolutionary war,
and this is something clearly we talked about in class and we&#39;ve talked about
in sections that&#39;s linked to some of the discussions that we&#39;ve been having
about how radical the Revolution was or wasn&#39;t. So the elite, like everyone
else, were profoundly affected by the Revolution, but of course they&#39;re not the
people who get to decide the fate of the Revolution. It&#39;s the American public
who gets to make that decision. It&#39;s their opinions of the new government that
are going to either make or break the government and the Revolution. And during
the period covered by this course we&#39;ve seen the beginnings of a long period
during which public opinion would continue to change, sometimes really
dramatically, concerning just what this new government and this new nation was
supposed to be. </p>
<p>Now, I&#39;m not going to
end by continuing here to talk about the end of the Revolution, because it
isn&#39;t just the events of the Revolution that mattered, even when they&#39;re
ending. It&#39;s actually how we remember them that matters, because the way that
we remember history obviously really determines its meaning and its impact. So
basically, history -- and how we understand our history -- can have a profound
effect on the here and now. In a way, this is what Jefferson referred to -- I
think a couple lectures back -- I&#39;ve talked about the dead hand of the past;
Jefferson wanting to -- every nineteen years, &#39;let&#39;s make a new constitution.&#39;
That&#39;s kind of linked to that Jeffersonian idea of the dead hand of the past --
and since history could have that impact on the present, depending on how you
understand it. And that dead hand of the past can be a pretty heavy hand. </p>
<p>At this point,
basically I need -- I need to tell you an anecdote. I actually do need to tell
you an anecdote. As I was writing the lecture this morning, I was writing about
the dead hand of the past, and I guess whenever I use that phrase, I think of
this one particular letter I found -- which actually is relevant, so I&#39;m not
being completely random. It does have something to do with the dead hand of the
past and history. It actually also has nothing to do with the American
Revolution, but it really shows you how the past can have an enormous weight on
the present. And it&#39;s also just an amazing little piece of paper that I found. </p>
<p>And it has to do with
this letter that I found when I was rummaging through the Adams family
correspondence, which is indeed what it&#39;s called: the Adams family. So the John
Adams family correspondence -- and I found this letter from John Quincy Adams.
I wasn&#39;t looking for it, but I found this letter. And he was overseas when his
father was running for President and he -- clearly he really wants to know if
his father won. And it takes a long time for news to make it across the ocean,
so what I found was first one letter in which he&#39;s writing, &#39;Do you know what
happened in the election?&#39; And then I found a lot of them. He&#39;s writing to
people and writing to people saying, &#39;Do you know? Do you know? Has my father
won the election? Who&#39;s won the election? What&#39;s happened in the election?&#39;
So, I can&#39;t help it. Now I&#39;m following the trail, because I have to find the
letter where he finds out. Right? And you would assume -- I assumed -- that
when I found that letter, he would say something like, &#39;Oh, this is a great day
for America&#39; or -- I don&#39;t know -- something, something lofty and visionesque,
sort of looking out -- ahh -- sort of John Quincy Adamsesque. </p>
<p>So finally I find the
letter, and I&#39;m going to paraphrase it with my own bad paraphrasing here, but
the point will be true. He basically says, &#39;Oh, God. I&#39;ll never live up to
this.&#39; [laughter] It is like -- the first thing he thinks is: now I&#39;m going to
have to be President too. [laughter/laughs] That was amazing to me. I really
felt for John Quincy Adams. You suddenly got a quick flash of what it felt like
to be an Adams, [laughs] or particularly -- the Adams family had a habit of
picking one Adams per generation and then dumping all of their expectations on
that one Adams. Clearly, John Quincy Adams is this generation&#39;s guy, so it certainly
gives you a sense of -- I want to say dead hand of the past; I guess it&#39;s the
live hand of the past, because it&#39;s his father, this poor guy. Anything his
father does he&#39;s clearly like: &#39;oh, damn, [laughs] now I have to be President
to&#39; [laughs] -- which is amazing, but concrete -- a concrete example of what
I&#39;m talking about here. And it certainly shows how the next generation beyond
the Founding generation really felt like they had to live up to the
achievements of what had gone before them. </p>
<p>Now, as far as the
people who had gone before them, as far as the Fathers are concerned, they knew
that they were becoming history, and so they thought about the making of
history and the writing of history a lot. To me, the most concrete example of
people becoming history is something that happened to poor Thomas Jefferson in
his old age. I wonder if any of you have ever seen a life mask. You know
there&#39;s death masks and life masks. Death masks are obvious, but there do exist
life masks as well. </p>
<p>So again, in
Jefferson&#39;s old age, someone went to Monticello and they wanted to make a life
mask of him. I don&#39;t know who this guy was, but he wasn&#39;t good at his job, so
whatever he did he did it wrong. And his daughter later said she came into the
room to see the guy with a hammer and chisel trying to chip the plaster like: &#39;oh,
my God, I killed him.&#39; [laughs] The plaster hardened and they couldn&#39;t get it
off [laughter] so Jefferson&#39;s basically thinking, this is so bad; [laughs] this
is really bad. He really was terrified that that was the end for him. He
literally almost became history. He was history. He was gone. [laughter]
Luckily, they got the plaster off and he survived. </p>
<p>But aside from the
fact that he almost melted into plaster, obviously that whole cohort of people
had really strong feelings about the story of the Revolution, about how that
story should be told, and they were not in love with the whole idea that the Founding
period is some kind of golden age of patriotic perfection. They did not see the
Revolution as some kind of divine strike of providence; they did not see
themselves as demigods. </p>
<p>And here I&#39;m going to
turn to John Adams, which always makes me happy -- who did a really good job in
his old age of answering letters from strangers who wanted to know: &#39;Tell us
about the Revolution. What really happened?&#39; And in answering, he did a great
job of basically popping bubbles of myths. He basically said over and over
again in one way or another, &#39;You know, the Revolution wasn&#39;t some kind of
golden, wonderful moment.&#39; Now, like the other Founders -- He actually lived
to be ninety, so unfortunately he had a lot of these letters. I think Jefferson
-- I think -- I was about to say Jefferson, I think got more, which obviously
would make Adams really mad. Like: &#39;even now [laughter/laughs] they&#39;re thinking
about him more than me&#39; -- but I think all of these guys were getting these
letters from people, basically in one way or another saying, &#39;Tell us. What was
it really like? What was it like? What happened you signed the Declaration?
What happened? What was it really like?&#39; </p>
<p>Jefferson in
particular was driven crazy. Jefferson doesn&#39;t normally emote on paper in a
deep kind of sincere, he&#39;s-not-thinking-hard way. You always get a sense he&#39;s
thinking really carefully about how he expresses himself, but when he&#39;s writing
to Adams in their old age, he really sort of vents about this whole
strangers-writing-letters-and-asking-about-history thing. So he says -- he
complains: &quot;From sunrise to one or two o&#39;clock, and often from dinner to
dark, I am drudging at the writing table. And all this to answer letters into
which neither interest nor inclination on my part enters; and often from
persons whose names I have never before heard.&quot; And in this letter,
Jefferson estimates that in 1822 he got 1,267 of these letters from people --
just strangers: &#39;tell us about the Declaration.&#39; He called it &quot;the burthen&quot;
of his life. </p>
<p>And then at one point
in this letter [correction: from a letter in 1822; the quote above is from
1817] -- and this is where I felt like he really hit Jeffersonian bottom --
he&#39;s whining and whining and he&#39;s going on, &#39;I hate this. I hate this. Will
they stop?&#39; Probably Adams was thinking, &#39;send some to me; [laughter] I have
something to say.&#39; But finally at this point in the letter, Jefferson just
writes: &quot;Is this life?&quot; [laughter] I just thought -- that&#39;s so
weirdly modern. That&#39;s like something we have probably all said at one point:
Is this life? Please stop writing me the letters. </p>
<p>His life actually got
worse on this front. You got to -- You&#39;re feeling bad for the Founders here.
People didn&#39;t just deluge him with random letters. Strangers made pilgrimages
to Monticello. It became like a tourist attraction and he was still living in
it. And so strangers would come and just swarm around Monticello, peering in
the windows [laiughter], like: &#39;oops, I broke the glass&#39; -- [laughter] like
trampling the garden. [laughter] He got so overwhelmed by this that he
basically after a while left Monticello and lived in one of his other homes for
a while, like: &#39;I just can&#39;t take it. [laughs] I&#39;m abandoning my house to the
strangers; I&#39;m going to go live in my other house for a little while.&#39; </p>
<p>And that&#39;s why,
actually those of you who have been to Monticello and you&#39;ve seen his little
sanctuary -- There&#39;s a little area that&#39;s really his and he has sort of all his
books and his bed and it -- really there are doors that can lock it off to
everything, which is really there for a real reason, because that was -- that
literally was his sanctuary. That was like: the swarms are outside, lock, lock,
lock, lock, like, you&#39;re not coming in. So, I think it wasn&#39;t fun being a Founder
basically. I think that&#39;s what Jefferson is showing us here. </p>
<p>But whether or not
they were happy old Founders, the Founding types who were answering these
letters were really trying to shape the telling of the history of the Revolution.
And different Founders I&#39;m sure had different messages, and some were probably
happier than others or more optimistic than others. I think James Madison was
optimistic to the end. Adams, as I said before, spent a lot of time sort of
punching holes in myths about the Revolution, that already were circulating in
the 18-teens and the 1820s. So over and over and over again, he told people
that there had not been some kind of unanimous patriotic, glorious moment, as
it seemed to have been, looking from the distance of time. </p>
<p>So in response to one
letter, he insisted that the Revolution was not a big wave of unanimous
patriotism. As he put it, &quot;Every measure of Congress from 1774 to 1787
inclusively, was disputed with acrimony, and decided by as small majorities as
any question is decided these days&quot; -- actually saying, &#39;It&#39;s not we were
like, yes, independence!&#39; He&#39;s saying, &#39;Sometimes it&#39;s one or two votes that we
decided this, and it goes out into history and all that people know is we voted
yes and it seems unanimous, and it really wasn&#39;t.&#39; </p>
<p>Even iconic
revolutionary moments, he thought, should not be viewed as the sort of glorious
moments of triumph. He -- In one letter, he recalled what he was thinking as he
watched people, his fellow congressmen, sign the Declaration of Independence. And
he said, &quot;I could not see their hearts, ... but, as far as I could
penetrate the intricate foldings of their Souls, I then believed, and have not
since altered my Opinion, that there were several who signed with regret, and
several others, with many doubts and much lukewarmness.&quot; So he&#39;s saying, &#39;Okay.
Even while they&#39;re signing the Declaration, I don&#39;t think some of these people
actually really wanted to be signing it at all. And some of them, I think, kind
of wished they were somewhere else not signing it&#39; -- which is not the image
that&#39;s floating around at this point about what the Revolution was. So people
were disagreeing, he&#39;s saying, back in the Revolutionary era. They caved to the
majority. They weren&#39;t sure about what they were doing. They didn&#39;t even like
what they were doing sometimes, and their decisions weren&#39;t always good. </p>
<p>He of course had
something to say about that as well, so he said in a different letter, &quot;I
say we do not make more mistakes now than we did in 1774, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.&quot;
He&#39;s clearly making a point here. When I was copying this I was like: how many
more years? &quot;80, 81, 82, 83.&quot; I get your point. [laughs] We made a
lot of mistakes through the whole Revolution, he&#39;s saying. &quot;It was patched
and piebald ... then, as it is now, ... and ever will be, world without
end.&quot; </p>
<p>Nor were battlefields
any more sacrosanct. As Adams put it, &quot;We blundered at Lexington, at
Bunker&#39;s Hill. ... Where, indeed, did we not blunder except Saratoga and York[town],
where our Tryumphs redeemed all former disgraces?&quot; So Adams is insisting,
much of the time: we weren&#39;t all that great. We made mistakes back then. We
didn&#39;t always entirely believe what we were doing. It wasn&#39;t that different
from how it is now. The Revolution was not some golden age of perfection. </p>
<p>And Adams summed all
of this up in a letter that I like, because in some way -- I don&#39;t know -- it
seems a little more direct than some of these other letters, and I suppose -- well,
you&#39;ll hear the way he phrases it. He wrote this letter in 1811, and he said to
this one correspondent -- who said, &#39;I revere the Fathers. I want to be like
them. Ahhh.&#39; -- all the things he&#39;s getting in all of these letters. And he
says, &quot;I ought not to object to your reverence for your fathers... . But,
to tell you a [very] great secret, as far as I am capable of comparing the
merit of different periods, I have no reason to believe we were better than you
are.&quot; He was being really straightforward about this. </p>
<p>Now, all of those
quotes of course are from the sort of lofty Adams, the far-seeing Adams, the
sage Adams. They&#39;re not from the Adams I was just referring to a few minutes
ago, which is the I-don&#39;t-get-any-respect John Adams, and he&#39;s there too. Both
of those things are there at the same time, which also tells you something.
When you read the correspondence of his old age, he&#39;s sort of veering back and
forth between: I am a lofty Founder. Why won&#39;t anyone recognize me as a lofty Founder?
I am a lofty Founder. Please, someone recognize me. He has all these letters
where he&#39;s like: &#39;no one will ever make a monument to me, John Adams&#39; [laughter]
-- like: so, so sorry. But my point here is that, to Adams and to many others,
you&#39;re not supposed to look at history at this sort of golden, perfect moment
that&#39;s drastically different, in that sense, from everything since. </p>
<p>In a sense, to these
people, worshipping the founding era, or worshipping the American Revolution,
as a golden age actually did more harm than good. The Revolution had been all
about beginnings, about beginning traditions and patterns of governance, about
beginning new constitutions, but these beginnings were actually supposed to go
someplace. They were supposed to lead to something that actually would survive
and be shaped by future generations. So I think to this whole generation, this
idea of sort of worshipping the Founding era as a golden age made it seem as
though the time for that kind of work had ended -- as though there was a glorious,
wonderful creative moment when things could really be done, and now that time
is gone. </p>
<p>And you could see
that in Adams&#39; letters too -- that he says often about the future: &#39;Well, maybe
it&#39;ll be a brighter page or maybe it&#39;ll be a darker page. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s up
to you.&#39; But he assumes -- obviously -- that what they&#39;ve been doing isn&#39;t
some dead-end moment at which who knows what&#39;ll happen next. He actually
assumes they started something that in one way or another they assume is going
to continue. So clearly, the time for that kind of creative political work
hadn&#39;t ended whenever the random date is that we decide the American Revolution
ended, and in a sense it hasn&#39;t ended. </p>
<p>As the Founding
generation well knew, American citizens are always responsible for their
government. They control its destiny. Right? They decide when revolutions
start. They decide when revolutions stop. They control the destiny of the
aftereffect of revolutions. </p>
<p>So I guess in a sense
-- And this is where I was really struggling this morning. I was like: what
would be the ultimate message I give to you? It&#39;s so hard when you teach
courses on the Founding period because everything you say has weird resonance
in the present -- as I&#39;m kind of saying here -- and I don&#39;t want to have weird
resonance in the present [laughs]. I just want to sort of give something to you
guys. So related to what I&#39;m saying here, maybe the ultimate message, the sort
of ground-level message of this course is: your opinions matter and your
actions out there in the world politically and otherwise are going to matter
too. That&#39;s in essence what these Founders are saying, when they&#39;re saying, &#39;Don&#39;t
treat us like demigods, like we&#39;re some lofty population that will never come
again. We set something in motion and the whole point of the thing that we set
in motion is that you&#39;re supposed to make it run.&#39; Right? It&#39;s actually about
you. We may be memorable guys. I might want to be a more memorable guy than I
am, but it&#39;s all about you; it&#39;s all about you.&#39; That&#39;s what&#39;s supposed to keep
it running in the end. </p>
<p>Okay. I want to first
of all thank you for laughing at my jokes all semester. [laughter] Obviously,
one of my favorite things to do is to tell stories, and lecture courses are
moments where you&#39;re completely my hostage and I get to -- Sometimes as I&#39;m
writing a lecture, as today, I&#39;m like: oh, this isn&#39;t related but I&#39;ll find a
way to rope it in to the lecture so then I can give it to you. So, I have
greatly enjoyed myself this semester. You&#39;ve been wonderfully receptive. You
asked -- When I went to sections you asked wonderful questions. You engaged
with the material. After lectures you guys kept coming up to me and asking good
questions, which was impressive and doesn&#39;t always happen in a lecture course.
So I want to thank you because it makes me really happy if you guys are really
engaged with what I&#39;m talking about here. So, thank you very much. [applause] </p>
