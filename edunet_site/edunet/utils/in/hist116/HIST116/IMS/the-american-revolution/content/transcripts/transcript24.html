<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>On
Thursday, I gave the world&#39;s most condensed lecture about the Constitution, and
I mentioned three controversies that represented long-standing concerns in Revolutionary
America: the question of representation, the problem of slavery, and then the
question of a national executive--so that really boils down to the problem of
investing power in one man. Now I did manage to discuss all three of those
things briefly before the end of the lecture. </p>
<p>I did not have time
to discuss one last issue, which I do want to talk about here before I go into
the real topic of today&#39;s lecture. I just ran out of time. And it actually
combines two of those issues. It&#39;s the combination of the problem of
representation and the problem of slavery, and it&#39;s something you&#39;ve all
studied in high school, I am sure, and that is the Three-Fifths Compromise. And
in a sentence, the Three-Fifths Compromise is the decision to count three-fifths
of a state&#39;s slaves in apportioning representatives, presidential electors and
direct taxes. So obviously by doing that--and that is a compromise of sorts--it
is trying to grapple with the problem of slavery and the question of
representation, but obviously that&#39;s a compromise that bolsters Southern
political power. </p>
<p>Now the great
historian of slavery, Yale professor emeritus David Brion Davis, has this
little calculation associated with this issue. Davis writes that in the
Continental Congress there had been five states in which slavery was a major
institution. So the Southern states in the Continental Congress had about thirty-eight
percent of the seats in that Congress. Because of the Three-Fifths Compromise,
when the first U.S. Congress opened under the new Constitution, Southern states
now had forty-five percent of the seats in the House, so thirty-eight to forty-five
is a significant slide. Now that doesn&#39;t stay ingrained that way, because
population increases in the North and things change over time, but certainly
that&#39;s one way in which you can see the impact of that Three-Fifths Compromise.
</p>
<p>Now in a way that Compromise--it&#39;s
a great segue into my lecture today--it&#39;s a great example of the larger dynamic
of the period that we&#39;re focusing on here toward the end of the course. Because,
as we&#39;ve been looking at in the Constitutional Convention--as we&#39;re going to
see today when we&#39;re looking at ratification--at the heart of the political
developments that we&#39;re looking at in this period is compromise: compromise between
North and South; compromise between big states and small states; compromise
between people who want to centralize power and people who want strong state
governments. </p>
<p>So basically what
we&#39;re looking at in this period is Americans deciding where and how to invest
power, obviously a highly charged decision that would have been impossible to
make without a string of compromises. And in a way, as we&#39;re going to be
discussing today, this is sort of a fundamental question at the heart of the Revolution
and its immediate aftermath. Where should the nation invest power? Where does
power go? </p>
<p>So in a way, if you
look back to the beginning of the course, think about the Revolution, think
about some of the central issues, you could say that the Revolution certainly
was about power. Right? It was a rebellion against what many perceived as
tyrannical power, and that means a lot of things but to sum that all up in a
sentence, you could say that. You could say that the 1770s and then the 1780s
show Americans trying to figure out how to rebalance and reorganize power--the
power of state--that they strip away the British administration and now they
have to figure out where else to place power and how to balance it. And we&#39;ve
seen the Articles of Confederation and now the Constitution, which is again
part of this ongoing dialogue trying to figure out the balance of power in all
sorts of different ways. </p>
<p>And it&#39;s no wonder--if
you think about what I&#39;ve already just talked about as far as the Constitution
is concerned--it&#39;s no wonder that it demanded a string of difficult and often
experimental compromises. Creating the Constitution and--as we&#39;ll see today--ratifying
the Constitution was a difficult process. We tend to think of the outcome and
we don&#39;t think of the process, </p>
<p>And I&#39;m always
reminded of this fact when I read an exchange of letters between Jefferson and
Madison, and it&#39;s actually written not long after the Constitution goes into
effect. I think it&#39;s written in early 1790, and at that point Jefferson had
been overseas, he&#39;d been in France on diplomatic duty, so he&#39;s off in the
distance knowing that they&#39;re debating the Constitution in the United States,
but he&#39;s on foreign shores, lounging in salons, chatting about philosophical
issues with the French. Meanwhile, Madison is in the Constitutional Convention
slaving away, and then he&#39;s outside of it sort of hammering away at
ratification, so Madison&#39;s clawing over the issue of the Constitution;
Jefferson&#39;s kind of looking from afar. </p>
<p>So he writes this
letter to Madison early 1790 saying that no generation should be bound to the
actions of any previous generation. It&#39;s one of those Jefferson letters in
which he&#39;s like: &#39;I have an interesting idea, let me share it with you,&#39; and he
starts out with this sort of idea about generations. Each generation is a
distinct thing and should never be bound by the one that came before--and it
has this famous line. Some of you may have heard it already: &quot;The earth
belongs ... to the living,&quot; right?--that the living should be controlling
things; the dead hand of the past should not have weight in the present. </p>
<p>In typical Jefferson
style he then calculates what a generation is. Right? It&#39;s not enough to say
generations are distinct. He says, Well, how long is a generation anyway? I
will calculate this out. Oh, a generation is nineteen years&#39;--by Thomas
Jefferson. So he decides a generation is nineteen years and then says to
Madison, &#39;So every nineteen years we need a new Constitution.&#39; [laughs] Okay.
So Jefferson, writing to the slaving-away-Constitution guy, says, &#39;Let&#39;s do
this every nineteen years. I think that would be much fairer. It wouldn&#39;t bind
the present to the past.&#39; </p>
<p>Now when I read that
letter and then I read Madison&#39;s response, Madison is really tactful. Madison&#39;s
a tactful guy, and he&#39;s tactful in his response, but when you look beneath the
surface of Madison&#39;s reply, I always feel like what you see there is this
sustained howl of disbelief, like: &#39;What!? Yeah, you try that next time, Teej,
and then you come back here and tell me you want to do that in nineteen years. [laughter]
No.&#39; So Madison&#39;s not happy about it but he actually is tactful, and what he
says to Jefferson is, he praises Jefferson&#39;s, quote, &quot;many interesting
reflections.&quot; [laughs] It&#39;s like: &#39;Thank you, Mr. Madison&#39;--and then adds,
unfortunately, quote, they are &quot;not in all respects compatible with the
course of human affairs,&quot; or in other words, real people don&#39;t act that
way [laughs]--like Jefferson, nice idea, not going to work in implementation.
That&#39;s not for real life. For real people, it doesn&#39;t work, but cute idea; keep
them coming. Like, it&#39;s interesting. We can just keep the conversation going;
we&#39;re not doing another Constitution in nineteen years. </p>
<p>So that&#39;s certainly
one compromise that Madison is not willing to sign on to, but of course the
compromises don&#39;t end with the closing of the Federal Convention. Creating the
Constitution is a major accomplishment. Now it has to be ratified. There needed
to be nine states to ratify it for it to go into effect, and each state would
have its own ratifying convention to decide the issue. Now things would have
been difficult enough if that was the only challenge at hand--if all that they
were facing was ratification debates in the states--but the fact is, there were
a slew of things that could have gone wrong even before we got to actual
ratification. </p>
<p>For one thing, the
Confederation Congress might just disapprove of the Constitution and refuse to
send it on to the states. It was entirely possible that the Congress might have
said, &#39;You know, you didn&#39;t just amend the Articles. You wrote a new
Constitution. I&#39;m sorry. We don&#39;t consider that valid. Nice try. We&#39;re not
going to send it on&#39;--and that would have been a little interesting moment.
It&#39;s just as possible that individual states might refuse to consider it for
the same reason. And even if some states did consider this Constitution and did
decide to ratify it, if large influential states like Virginia or Massachusetts
or New York rejected the Constitution, their influence might actually compel
other states to follow their example and vote against it. </p>
<p>So all of this is
sort of looming out there. It&#39;s unclear if any of this is going to happen, but
for those who are really supporting this new Constitution, they really knew
that they had a pretty big challenge facing them. If the Constitution made it
to the states for ratification, if the states agreed to consider it, then they
had to worry about the actual debate over whether this Constitution was a just,
trustworthy division of power. Now, the first horrible possibility did not take
place, and the Confederation Congress passes on the Constitution to the states
for consideration on September 28, 1787, but still, with the question of
ratification looming, clearly the fate of the Constitution is left hanging for
a good many months. </p>
<p>And I mentioned last
time I was going to go back to Ezra Stiles, because his diary is useful and
wonderful--and I&#39;m going to go right back here to Ezra Stiles just for a few
minutes. Because his diary shows you one man--certainly one elite, highly
educated, influential man with very high-placed friends--but still one man who
is watching events unfold related to the Constitution, and is trying to figure
out what he thinks about them. He&#39;s interested to know what&#39;s happening. He&#39;s
not sure what he thinks and he&#39;s trying to figure this out. </p>
<p>So one thing that his
diary shows is that certainly he was intensely interested in whatever the heck
was going on in Philadelphia. He didn&#39;t know what was going on in Philadelphia,
but he really wanted to know. And on June 19,<sup> </sup>he apparently asked
Yale College seniors to debate the following question: &quot;Whether the States
acted wisely in send[in]g Delegates to the Gen. Convention now sitting in Philadelphia?&quot;
I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, but Yale students, debate amongst yourselves.
Do you think that was a good idea? In November of 1787, the question that he
poses for Yale College seniors has changed. Now he says, Yale College seniors,
debate for yourself: &quot;Whether it is expedient for the States to adopt the
new Constitution?&quot; </p>
<p>In late December,
some of his curiosity gets satisfied because he actually gets to spend the
night with Abraham Baldwin, who had been a delegate in the Convention, so this
is his chance. There&#39;s a guy who was there. He&#39;s going to really sort of plug
away at Baldwin, find out what really happened. And at the end of the evening
this is what Stiles wrote in his diary: </p>
<p>&quot;I have formed
this as my Opinion. 1. That it is not the most p[er]fect Constitution yet 2. That
it is a very good one, &amp; that it is advisable to adopt it. However, 3. That
tho&#39; much of it will be permanent &amp; lasting, yet much of it will be
hereafter altered by future Revisions. And 4. That the best one remains yet to
be investigated.&quot; </p>
<p>And then he goes on
to add: &quot;When the Convention was proposed I doubted its Expediency. 1. &quot;--he&#39;s
really a guy for lists--</p>
<p>&quot;1. Because I
doubted whether our wisest Men had yet attained Light eno&#39; to see &amp; discern
the best, &amp; what ought finally to prevail. 2. Neither did I think the
People were ripe for the Reception of the best one if it could be
investigated. And yet 3. I did not doubt but Time &amp; future Experience
would teach, open &amp; lead us to the best one. And tho&#39; we have got a much
better one than I expected, &amp; a very good one, yet my Judgt still remains
as before.&quot; </p>
<p>And then he gets very
specific, and he says, &quot;I think there is not Power enough yet given to Congress
for firm Government.&quot; So he thinks about that on the one hand. At the
same time he worries that surrendering too much power to this new government will
end up, quote, &quot;prostratg the Sovereignty of the particular States.&quot;
On the one hand, he worries that the President might become, quote, &quot;an
uncontrollable &amp; absolute Monarch.&quot; On the other hand, he says,
&quot;I think--&quot; --First he says, &quot;I think the last as well guarded as
possible&quot; so yeah, he might become a monarch, but I think the Constitution
did as well as it could to prevent that from happening, and then goes on to
say, &quot;I know not whether it is possible to vest Congress with Laws, Revenues,
&amp; Army &amp; Navy, without endangering the Ruin of the interior Powers &amp;
Liberties of the States.&quot; </p>
<p>And that&#39;s a long
passage for someone to put in his own diary, but what&#39;s interesting about that
to me is you can see Stiles going back and forth. He says it&#39;s good but there&#39;s
probably a better one; it&#39;s better than I expected, but somehow it&#39;s not good
enough; it doesn&#39;t give enough power to Congress, but maybe it gives too much
power and the states will be prostrated; maybe the President is too powerful,
but if we give some of that power to congress maybe Congress will end up really
destroying the states. So you can see him there sort of reasoning through what
he thinks about the Constitution, and in one way or another, it&#39;s boiling down
to the balance of power; where should power be. He&#39;s not exactly sure where
power should be. He knows it&#39;s the issue, but he&#39;s not quite sure how to find
his way out. So clearly--and Stiles is an example of this--although the
delegates of the Constitutional Convention had agreed on a new form of
government, there was certainly not some huge, sweeping national consensus on
the best kind of government for the new American nation. </p>
<p>So the ratification
debates throughout the states--except for Rhode Island, which is not having a
debate--but in the rest of the states, the ones that are actually having big
ratification debates, these are really real debates. And often, these debates
focused on the question of power. As suggested by Stiles, one big question
along these lines was: how do you divide power between the national government
and the states? Patrick Henry of Virginia had this to say about the
Constitution, even before he got past its first three words. Patrick Henry is
upset by the first three words of the Constitution. This doesn&#39;t bode well for
the Virginia debate. Henry says, </p>
<p>&quot;My political
curiosity, exclusive of my anxious solicitude for the public welfare, leads me
to ask, who authorized them to speak the language of, We, the People, instead
of We, the States? States are the characteristics and the soul of a
confederation. If the states be not be agents of this compact, it must be one
great consolidated national government.&quot; </p>
<p>Samuel Adams is more
concise, but has the same idea. He also--those first three words--He can&#39;t get
past the first three words. He says, &quot;As I enter the Building I stumble at
the Threshold.&quot; Constitution--We, the people? We, the people? What is
that? What does that suggest about this government? They&#39;re both basically
asking, what kind of a government is this? It&#39;s not a league of states, a
confederation of states. It doesn&#39;t seem to be about the states. It appears to
be some kind of new powerful national government linking itself with the
American people and potentially dismissing the importance of individual states.
</p>
<p>In the minds of men
like Henry and Adams, if this was a really federal constitution surely the
document should begin with &quot;we, the states&quot; as opposed to &quot;we,
the people.&quot; What they&#39;re getting at--Henry and Adams--in those kinds of
statements is one of the most unique aspects of the proposed Constitution, and
I think in a sense its most brilliant compromise. And that&#39;s the idea of
federalism: the idea that both the states and the national government could
have large areas of power with the federal courts sort of acting as arbiters
about the limits of state and federal power. The real brilliance of federalism
is that it suggested that sovereignty could be divided between two levels of
government. That was an interesting idea. It was one that many people didn&#39;t
believe could actually be put into play, but it&#39;s a brilliant suggestion, a
really brilliant compromise. </p>
<p>For a population of
people who were worried about the birth of some kind of tyrannical centralized
national government, the concept of federalism at least had some potential. On
the other hand, the idea of nationalism was a lot more frightening. Right?
Nationalism suggests one big national blob and the obliteration of states, or
as Stiles put it, the prostration of the states. It&#39;s interesting to note that
in the Constitution, the word &quot;national&quot; does not appear--and as a
matter of fact, not only is the word &quot;national&quot; not in the original
Constitution, but during the debates when someone put it in, somebody else
always took it out. Right? No, no, we&#39;re not talking about national. It&#39;s
federal. It&#39;s all federal. It&#39;s not the scary big national thing. It&#39;s a
federal Constitution. And that&#39;s why, of course, the people who are defending
the Constitution call themselves Federalists, not nationalists, and thus the
opponents call themselves Anti-Federalists. </p>
<p>So federalism is a
really brilliant compromise in this battle over where to invest power, but
obviously it did not solve all questions, and for some people it didn&#39;t even
solve any of the questions. The ongoing ratification debate was actually really
fierce. And since by default we end up sort of all siding with the Federalists,
let&#39;s look for a moment at the Anti-Federalists and the sorts of things that
they were arguing in these debates throughout all of the states. </p>
<p>For one thing, like
everyone else, they are concerned with the placement of power. They worry that
this new national executive is going to be a tyrant and eventually a king. They
worry that state rights, state boundaries, state constitutions will be violated
by a tyrannical national government. They fear that the Constitution&#39;s going to
foster the creation of a standing army, which everyone of course believes to be
the tool of tyranny. They fear that some kind of overbearing aristocracy is
going to take over and repress the common man. They fear a lack of proper
representation. They fear that they&#39;re not going to have the right sort of a
voice, or any voice, in this new centralized government. </p>
<p>When you read about
these fears in their original form--and of course throughout this period and
throughout all of these debates they&#39;re writing newspaper essays; they&#39;re
writing pamphlets; they&#39;re giving speeches. This is a literal debate in print
and in person, and when you read some of these Anti-Federalist essays and
pamphlets, you can really see how some of them are directly relatable to the Revolution
just fought and hopefully won. I guess in their mind maybe it hadn&#39;t been won
yet because it depends on what happens with this government. They&#39;re talking
about tyranny. They&#39;re talking about monarchy. They&#39;re talking about violated
liberties. They&#39;re talking about aristocracy. They&#39;re talking about unjust
representation. You could sort of draw a line and understand where these fears
come from. </p>
<p>Just listen to how
some Anti-Federalists actually expressed these fears. One writer wrote that the
Constitution was, quote, &quot;the most odious system of tyranny that was ever
projected.&quot; Patrick Henry, who is always useful for wonderful quotes, in
the Virginia Convention says that by giving so much power to a new national
government, quote, &quot;the tyranny of Philadelphia [the Federal Convention]
may be like the tyranny of George III.&quot; Okay. You can&#39;t draw a more
direct link than that. Right? Okay, Constitution, George III, tyranny--directly
harkening right back to the Revolution. And for many people these arguments
really rang true. </p>
<p>Now of course, in the
end the Federalists proved successful, this despite the fact that they really
were promoting a pretty radical change of government, and there are a good
number of reasons why they&#39;re successful. I&#39;m just going to mention a few here,
and one of them in a sense is really obvious but makes a lot of sense that it
acts in their favor, and that is: the Federalists are really national-minded,
so they&#39;re actually thinking beyond the bounds of their states and it makes
them much more likely to be able to create some kind of united publicity
campaign to argue on a national level in a way that perhaps Anti-Federalists
couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t. </p>
<p>Also one reason why
the Federalists prove successful is partly because the Anti-Federalists don&#39;t
offer any alternative to the Constitution. They critique what&#39;s there but they
don&#39;t offer an alternative suggestion, so the debate is criticism and the Federalists
defending and countering, criticism and the Federalists defending and
countering. That&#39;s a very particular kind of debate. If the Anti-Federalists
had come forward with another suggestion, it would have been a very different
kind of debate. </p>
<p>In some ways you
might argue that the Federalist victory was something of an Anti-Federalist
default. As South Carolina Anti-Federalist Aedanus Burke put it after the fact,
&quot;We had no principle of concert or union.&quot; We were sort of all
objecting on our own and we didn&#39;t have any unified campaign. Or, as Madison
put it, I think in a little bit of an exaggeration, the Anti-Federalists, quote,
&quot;had no plan whatever. They looked no farther than to put a negative on
the Constitution and return home.&quot; Okay. So maybe that&#39;s a little
exaggerated, but in fact there was no obvious concrete alternative presented by
the Anti-Federalists and that really was a fundamental weakness in their
position. </p>
<p>This does not mean,
however, that there were no good arguments against the Constitution, and the
best proof of that is the <i>Federalist </i>essays<i>, </i>which you&#39;re going
to be reading this week, because those essays aren&#39;t just explaining the
Constitution; they&#39;re defending the Constitution. And they&#39;re defending it
against this sea of fears and accusations and all these sort of wild ideas
floating around about what might happen or what&#39;s implied or what&#39;s suggested
or what&#39;s allowable in this new government. </p>
<p>The <i>Federalist </i>essays<i>
</i>were Hamilton&#39;s idea, and Hamilton invited his nationalist buddy, James
Madison, to join him in the effort and they also invited John Jay to take part--and
John Jay ended up getting sick, so he wrote a few essays and then he dropped
out so, as I&#39;m sure you well know, most of them are written by Madison and
Hamilton. The <i>Federalist </i>was not the only printed defense of the
Constitution. There were lots of them. There was obviously--As I said, it&#39;s a
big print debate, but the <i>Federalist </i>was something that was written with
really big ambitions because its authors really essentially were creating a
broad, comprehensive, step-by-step defense of the Constitution, and they really
hoped that by swaying the state of New York in favor of ratification, maybe
they would bring other states like Virginia along in its wake. </p>
<p>The essays were all
signed &quot;Publius.&quot; The authors all wrote under the same pseudonym
because they actually wanted the essays not to seem like the crafty arguments
of two really leading nationalists who were going to say anything to get us to
sign on to the Constitution. They wanted to suggest that these were just
even-handed, rational ideas that were sort of generally out in the public sphere.
Now of course among insiders, people figured out who the authors were, even
though supposedly no one&#39;s supposed to know. It&#39;s Publius. Who can that be?
People figured it out pretty quickly and sometimes the authors helped people
along. </p>
<p>And there&#39;s an
anecdote about Hamilton--I went digging to see if I could find ultimate
verification and I can&#39;t find ultimate verification, but I&#39;m going to offer it
anyway because there is a supposed witness to the story, but people aren&#39;t sure
whether to believe the witness. At any rate, Hamilton--supposedly the day
before his fatal duel with Aaron Burr--paid a call on a friend, a good
eighteenth-century name, Egbert Benson. He went to visit Egbert Benson, who was
a lawyer, and supposedly one of Benson&#39;s law clerks answered the door, said
that he would go find Benson, walked off to find Benson, and as he came back,
he said he saw Hamilton in Benson&#39;s library put something in a book and put the
book up on the shelf. And the clerk said, &#39;Mr. Benson&#39;s not here,&#39; and Hamilton
said, &#39;Thank you,&#39; and left. So of course the guy is like: I wonder what that
was? Right? So he goes over to the shelf and he pulls down the book. He wants
to see what it is. </p>
<p>And supposedly what
it was is a piece of paper in Hamilton&#39;s handwriting in which he&#39;d written all
of the <i>Federalist </i>essays<i> </i>that were his. So supposedly, the night
before the duel when he&#39;s like: &#39;got my checklist of things I&#39;d better do in
case I die tomorrow: number one, get credit for <i>Federalist </i>essays<i>. </i>[laughter/laughs]
Now it&#39;s unclear whether that actually happened or didn&#39;t happen. The guy--The
fellow who saw it in later years said he did see it, and said he saw the piece
of paper, and said the piece of paper at some point was given to the New York
Public Library, but then nobody quite knows where it is in the New York Public
Library. So it&#39;s unclear whether it really happened. People--Some people at the
time insisted it really did. </p>
<p>Whether or not it
really did, the fact is that actually the people who wrote it did care about it
and did care about which ones they wrote, and we don&#39;t entirely know who wrote
which in some cases. We know some are Hamilton essays and some are Madison
essays, and then there are some where it&#39;s blurrier and historians argue--give
one guy credit or the other guy credit over who--And I think that&#39;s partly--well,
partly because they were rushing, but also partly because in some cases they
probably were working together on some or sharing things. </p>
<p>The humbling thing to
remember when you read the <i>Federalist</i> this week--and this actually
should really mean something to any student--is that many of them are first
drafts. Okay. Those are rough drafts. That just makes me want to cry as a
writer. It&#39;s like oh, [laughs] why can&#39;t my rough drafts look like that? These
guys were writing for newspapers, so they were in a hurry, sometimes literally
dashing something off and getting it to the newspaper immediately. So they&#39;re
writing these in a hurry. They don&#39;t have time for a lot of revision. That to
me is an amazingly humbling thought. </p>
<p>All told, there were eighty-five
<i>Federalist </i>essays<i>. </i>As I said, they&#39;re published in New York
newspapers. The thought is they&#39;re going to sway the New York ratification
debate, and they appear between October 1787 and May of 1788. And then later,
in June of 1788, they get put out in book form. And then obviously they migrate
wherever they migrate to. Lots of other people read the <i>Federalist. </i></p>
<p>Now, as suggested by
its title, the <i>Federalist </i>--while it did demonstrate a lot of things about
the new Constitution--it did have one overriding argument, and that was: the
benefits of federalism. Right? Not nationalism--and they&#39;re sure to stress that
throughout all of the essays; we&#39;re not talking about nationalism.
Federal--federal--states are still important--the subtext of the calming
component of the <i>Federalist </i>essays<i>. </i>A federal government would
energize the government without prostrating the states or trampling on the
American people; that&#39;s the compromise of federalism. </p>
<p>And, as I mentioned
at some point earlier, in an earlier lecture, to demonstrate just how badly
this government needed to be energized, the <i>Federalist </i>essays<i> </i>show
again and again the disaster that would reign if the Articles of Confederation
were allowed to continue. And at some point, I did talk about the sort of ax
job that the <i>Federalist </i>essays<i> </i>do on the Articles of
Confederation. They really want to, because they have to prove that the
Articles are so bad that of course this new Constitution is the perfect thing.
It makes sense. You have to move in this direction. </p>
<p>So in New York and
elsewhere, the ratification debates wore on, states proceeding at different
paces. But there is one thing that emerged from these debates on the part of
the Anti-Federalists, and this actually is a specific suggestion on their part,
a specific idea about something that has to be there. Basically, throughout the
states one thing that Anti-Federalists consistently demanded was some kind of
guarantee of personal liberties, some kind of a declaration of rights like
those that existed in many state constitutions--something that would protect
personal liberties in the same document that seemed to be investing this new
government with so much power. So in essence, the Anti-Federalists want a bill
of rights. </p>
<p>Now from our vantage
point, a bill of rights just seems like an unquestionably good thing. Right? We
love our Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights is good. Why would the Federalists
not want a bill of rights? But the problem is, some Federalists did have
problems with this idea of a bill of rights. For one thing, they claimed that
the entire Constitution, by providing a well-framed government that had checks
and balances and government by election, in a sense you could argue that that
document was so framed and the government was so checked and balanced that it
was in and of itself a sort of bill of rights; it was a controlled government. </p>
<p>They also said, the
federal government has enumerated powers in this document. So in other words, a
power that is not given to the government is not owned by the government. Why
do we need a bill of rights saying well, we need to protect power of the press?
We haven&#39;t given power of the press to the national government, so why do we
need suddenly to mention it in a bill of rights? Some Federalists even argued
that if we start to write things down--put rights into writing--we might
actually imply something bad; we might actually imply--If we try to define the
freedom of press, freedom of religion and put it into words, maybe the
implication will be that in some way or another the national government
actually does have some power over those things. Maybe once we get into the
sea of rights, we might lead people to be able to conclude things about that
government down the road that we might not want them to conclude. </p>
<p>But the Anti-Federalists
had a pretty powerful argument in favor of a bill of rights. It was a
multileveled argument, but one part of it was particularly hard to argue with,
and that is: any republican government, any small &quot;r&quot; republican
government, ought to do everything that it could do to keep its citizens aware
of their rights, including something like listing them as amendments to the
Constitution. In other words, the Anti-Federalists say, &#39;Well, in a republic,
the people need to know their rights. They need to have them in writing. So of
course we should have a bill of rights so that the American public knows what
their rights are.&#39; </p>
<p>In the end, it was
only with the promise that a list of rights would be amended and added to the
Constitution that it was ultimately ratified. And so one by one, the states
debated, and then over time decided to ratify the Constitution. I think again,
as with so many things about this period and the Constitution debate, we don&#39;t
tend to think of it as a real fight or debate or controversy. We sort of see
things churning along and we imagine: ratification of the Constitution equals a
bunch of guys in a room signing pieces of paper like: ah, it&#39;s ratified, the
end, now let&#39;s have a government.&#39; But in fact, people were really anxiously
watching this--and curious. And are states going to ratify? How many will
ratify? Is this going to happen? Won&#39;t it happen? What happens if only half
of them ratify? This is something that people all over the United States were
watching and wondering what was going to happen. </p>
<p>Here Ezra Stiles
helps us out one more time because he put in his diary every time he heard that
a state had ratified the Constitution. So in the midst of everything else in
his diary, you&#39;ll see--like, on January 9, 1788, he writes that a courier raced
from Hartford to New Haven and made the entire trip in a mere hour and six
minutes, which--Actually, since it takes--what?--like 45 minutes by car to go
to Hartford, an hour and six minutes is pretty good for a horse I think, [laughter]
so that guy really raced to announce to New Haven that Connecticut had ratified
the Constitution. Right? He puts that down and he clearly was impressed with
the speed of the rider. </p>
<p>On February 11, New
Haven gets the news that Massachusetts ratified. Stiles puts this in his diary
and he adds: Bells were rung throughout the city and cannon were
discharged&quot; So now clearly, Connecticut has signed on; they&#39;re watching to
see who else is signing on and when someone else does sign on, there&#39;s a
celebration. At the end of June, Stiles noted that at about 1:30 in the
afternoon--and I love when they note the precise time, because then you know
it&#39;s something they believed to be significant. At 1:30 this afternoon, New
Haven received the news that New Hampshire had ratified--and that--New
Hampshire is the ninth state. So what that means is that now the Constitution
could go into effect. And as Stiles described it, &quot;As soon as the News
arrived the four Bells in the City were set a Ringing, &amp; the foederal Flag
displayed and foederal Discharges of Canon.&quot; What is actually a federal
discharge of cannon? I don&#39;t know what a federal--I never -- I typed that out
without stopping to think what a federal discharge of cannon is. But there was
a federal discharge of cannon &quot;-- &amp; Rejoycing&quot;--[laughs] general
rejoicing in New Haven--like: &#39;yay, the Constitution has kicked in; thank you,
New Hampshire.&#39; </p>
<p>Meanwhile, throughout
this period, Stiles still had Yale College seniors debating constitutional
issues. [laughs] If you were not interested in politics at this point at Yale
College, you were in deep trouble. He had them debate: &quot;Whether it had
been better to refer the new Constitution to the Ratificn by Town Meetings or a
Plurality of the personal Votes of all the Freemen of the United States?&quot;
Now that&#39;s kind of interesting, actually. That&#39;s kind of a radical thing for
him to ask the students to debate. Or whether the President of Congress--the
President of Congress?--&quot;the President ... ought to be visited with an
independt Power of Commandg the American Army?&quot; </p>
<p>If you&#39;re curious
about what other things Stiles has people debating in addition to random
constitutional issues, I just have a little sampling here to give you a sense
of what it would have been like to be a senior at Yale College in 1788 and
1789. They debated: &quot;Whether the Breakg up of the Roman Empire by the
Goths &amp; Vandals was prejudicial to the Progress of Literature?&quot; [laughter]
Can you imagine doing that one day and then the next day: and now [laughs]
let&#39;s talk about the President. They debated: &quot;Whether the Scriptures are
divinely inspired?&quot;; &quot;Whether good Policy is ever inconsistent with Justice?&quot;;
and &quot;Whether all mankd descended from Adam?&quot; Okay. That&#39;s a
wide-ranging bunch of things they&#39;re debating. I love the fact that Stiles
always puts that in his diary, so it&#39;s actually fascinating just to read
through and see what students were set to discuss at a given time. </p>
<p>Okay. So we&#39;ve seen a
national debate over a new Constitution. We&#39;ve seen a debate taking place
between people who by no means had an absolute consensus about what kind of
government should be put into place. Given that this was a national debate,
what does it show us about the state of the nation at the time? What does it
really suggest about the new nation and its principles? Well, certainly for
one thing, underneath all of the disagreement and the wrangling and the arguing,
there was some consensus. So certainly, both Federalists and Anti-Federalists
agreed that a small &quot;r&quot; republican government was the general aim and
goal--a government based on popular sovereignty, on the will of the people--a
government that placed the ultimate power in the hands of the people. So
that&#39;s a general consensus. I&#39;m going to talk in a moment about what that
means, but certainly in a general way people could agree on that. </p>
<p>Americans also could
generally agree that this was an experiment in government; that it was
something unique; that they were experimenting in the possibility of having
people sit down and deliberately create a just government grounded on the
rights and will of the populace. And to communicate this, to get this across,
I&#39;m going to read something. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve read this before. Have I--I
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve read the first paragraph or the first couple sentences from
the first <i>Federalist </i>essay. I went digging back into other lectures and
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done it yet, and if I have you&#39;re going to have to listen to
it twice, but I don&#39;t think I have. And I tend to read these couple sentences
in a lot of my classes because I think they really capture this idea about
experimentation that&#39;s looming over what they&#39;re doing at the time, this sense
that they really are deciding something major, not just in the Constitution
that they&#39;re creating but also in the process by which they&#39;re creating it--that
the fact that they&#39;re deliberating, debating, and then creating, and then
stepping back to allow it to go into effect, that also is something that they
see as major. </p>
<p>So this is from
within the first paragraph of <i>Federalist </i>No. 1 by Hamilton: </p>
<p>&quot;It has been
frequently remarked, that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this
country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question,
whether societies of men are really capable or not, of establishing good
government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to
depend for their political constitutions, on accident and force. ... [T]he
crisis, at which we are arrived, may with propriety be regarded as the aera in
which that decision is to be made; and a wrong election of the part we shall
act, may, ... deserve to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind.&quot;
</p>
<p>Okay.
&quot;Boom.&quot; That&#39;s a big statement. He is literally saying: the United
States is deciding for all time if you can sit and deliberate and create a just
government--or not, and if we do something stupid, the answer would appear to
be not--for all time. So this experiment is not just an experiment, but it&#39;s
one that to people at the time actually means something. They feel that they&#39;re
proving something in this experiment that they&#39;re undertaking. It has real
consequences. </p>
<p>Now that said, of
course even with the ratification of the Constitution, all kinds of questions
are still looming about exactly how this experiment was going to play out, or
indeed if it would survive at all. And wrapped up in this question about what&#39;s
going to happen with the government is a deeper question about whether the
promise of the Revolution is actually going to be fulfilled. The Revolution has
all of this promise attached to it. There&#39;s all of this debate about how to
bring that kind of promise to life. Here is one try. It&#39;s a constitution. We&#39;re
going to put it into effect. </p>
<p>And people now have
to step back and see if it&#39;s going to work--and many, many people are
absolutely not convinced that it&#39;s going to fulfill all that promise that was
unleashed by the Revolution. It&#39;s one thing to assign power in a document, and
it&#39;s another thing to really bring that document to life. If you think about
our Constitution, it&#39;s a pretty short document; it&#39;s pretty brief. It&#39;s a
framework. It doesn&#39;t go into lots of detail. So there&#39;s a lot of things that
had to be fleshed out and worked out once that government went into effect. </p>
<p>And in Thursday&#39;s
lecture, I&#39;m going to touch on some of that. I&#39;m going to talk a little bit
about how this begins to play out in the 1790s and what that suggests about the
legacy of the Revolution overall. I will stop there. I will see you on
Thursday, our last class. </p>
