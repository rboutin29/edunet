<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>So
today I&#39;ve titled the lecture for today &quot;Confederation,&quot; but in a
sense I&#39;m going to be talking about something larger than that, and by the end
of the lecture I&#39;ll be talking about the Articles of Confederation. I&#39;ll talk a
little bit more about them on Thursday. But as I mentioned last Thursday, last
Thursday&#39;s lecture, today&#39;s lecture and actually some of the few that are left --
that are still to come--are all in one way or another dealing with big
questions that were left looming after the fighting of the Revolution had
passed. And we dealt with one of them on Thursday and that was the question of
what would happen to American society, and I looked at that in a very specific
way but I was touching on that broader question, which is: okay, so we&#39;ve had a
Revolution; what does that do? And we sort of explored some things it did or
didn&#39;t do. </p>
<p>Today I&#39;m going to
discuss a different big question left over after the fighting and actually
going on even during the fighting, and that is the question of what would
happen to American governance; how would independence from Great Britain
actually affect the way that the states individually functioned and the way
that they were governed together? And it&#39;s not--obviously it&#39;s not just a
question of little political technicalities because, as people at the time
really knew, aside from the obvious task of winning the war and gaining
independence, it was really political change. It was the shaping of new state
governments and the creation of some kind of a new national or American
government that would most shape the real outcome of the Revolution as a whole.
</p>
<p>As Jefferson put it
right in the middle of the Revolution, &quot;In truth [a new government] is the
whole object of the present controversy.&quot; See, I love finding quotes from Founders
in which I think to myself I need a Founder to say that politics is important.
Oh, there&#39;s Thomas Jefferson now. [laughs] A new government &quot;is the whole
object of the present controversy; for should a bad government be instituted
for us in [the] future it had been as well to have accepted at first the bad
one offered to us from beyond the water without the risk and expence [sic] of
contest.&quot; </p>
<p>So basically, as
people at the time well knew, it was in the creation of governments in the
states and one for all of the states that the Revolution ultimately would be
lost or won. We&#39;re going to hear this -- people talking about the 1780s, when
they&#39;re a little alarmed at what is happening in the 1780s. They&#39;re going to
repeat that sentiment, like: &#39;uh oh, we thought we won and now we&#39;re going to
lose because everything&#39;s going to fall apart because of problems of
government.&#39; So on a really immediate level, Americans knew that if they wanted
to win the war in a broader sense, they had to have effective governments. And
obviously also in the longer term, they needed effective governments to
survive, to prosper, to last more than five years. It&#39;s fascinating when you
look at letters between these people in the first couple years under the
Constitution, and they&#39;re really not convinced it&#39;s going to last more than a
few years: nifty little experiment; maybe it&#39;s not going to work. </p>
<p>So people understood
government is the key. So when the colonies declared independence in 1776 and
these former colonies became states, they needed to create new state
governments that would basically write the royal government out of their form
of governance. And they--each state now needed to come up with a new way to
govern itself, or some decision about how they were going to govern themselves.
So from roughly 1776 through the 1780s, the individual states, and as we&#39;ll see
in a little bit, the Continental Congress, grappled with trying to figure out
the best mode of establishing new governments according to prevailing hopes and
ideals. </p>
<p>And this whole period
was really a remarkable period of political experimentation. As Benjamin
Franklin said, &quot;We are, I think, in the right Road of [the spirit of] Improvement,
for we are making Experiments.&quot; Right? There&#39;s a man of science.
Basically, in this whole period, not just the Revolution but a little before
and certainly after, fueled by the optimism of the Revolution and fueled by the
whole spirit of the Enlightenment, this was an age of experiments in
government. </p>
<p>And--I always find
when I try to get across what it felt like at that time, how people thought
about politics at that time, I&#39;m always sort of trying to figure out some great
metaphor, something that I can say, and I always come back to the same
comparison, which somehow, at least in the last five or six years, has always
been true. And that is, in a sense to get a feeling for what it felt like to
think about politics and experience politics in the late eighteenth century,
think about how we now experience and think about technology. Okay, because
basically they could announce tomorrow that Apple was secretly coming up with a
device that allows you to see inside every home in America, and we would go, &#39;Oh,
interesting,&#39; but we would accept that maybe that exists. There&#39;s--On our part
there&#39;s a sort of expectation that new technological innovations are popping up
all the time, and they might have us doing or thinking things that we never did
before. We&#39;re communicating in new ways. Technology I think for us is this
realm where anything can happen and things are happening all the time and we&#39;re
adjusting and we&#39;re excited and we&#39;re interested. And that&#39;s where a lot of
the innovation is now with people sort of trying to pour--every app-maker in
America -- people creating and innovating and devising and creating. And that
kind of spirit -- transport that back to the late eighteenth century. That&#39;s
the way that people were feeling about government. </p>
<p>That was the period
in which government was doing all of those things. There were innovations.
There were--It was experimental. People didn&#39;t know what was going to happen.
They were challenging rules of government and sort of seeing what would happen.
It was--Particularly for people who were interested in politics, it was a
fascinating sort of wonderful time because all of these weird things were
happening and they were big, literally constitutional things on a really big
level. </p>
<p>And you can hear this
kind of excitement in a statement that John Adams wrote in 1776 in a pamphlet
that I&#39;ll be discussing in a few minutes, and it&#39;s titled <i>Thoughts on
Government</i>,<i> </i>and Adams wrote: &quot;You and I, my dear Friend, have
been sent into life at a time when the greatest lawgivers of antiquity would
have wished to have lived.-- How few of the human race have ever enjoyed an
opportunity of making an election of government ... for themselves or their
children.&quot; People knew that what they were doing at that time was a big
deal, and they knew it could effect enormous change. </p>
<p>So what I&#39;m going to
be talking about today, in that spirit, are these experiments in government --
people experimenting in government -- and I&#39;m going to talk about these kinds
of experiments on two levels. First, I&#39;ll talk about state constitution-making
and how people were trying to figure out what to do on a state level, and then
I&#39;ll discuss the process of joining all of these states together into some kind
of a confederation or, as the Articles of Confederation themselves put it, a &quot;league
of friendship.&quot; That&#39;s how the government defined itself -- the Articles
-- a league of friendship. </p>
<p>But I want to start
with state constitutions -- and the fact is, although to us we think &quot;constitution&quot;
is sort of the big, looming thing that&#39;s important in that period, to people at
the time, certainly in the middle of the Revolution, it was really in the
drafting of state constitutions that they really thought the future of the
American people was going to be decided. Even before the formal Declaration of
Independence in July of 1776, already people in the colonies had been giving
some thought to the fact that they were going to need new state constitutions
because already things were unstable, sources of authority--royal sources of
authority--were not necessarily in place, but it was unclear what was in place
instead of them. So people already saw the need for some kind of new legitimate
source of authority and they began thinking: &#39;okay, well, if we do end up being
independent we need some kind of a new government so we&#39;d better start talking
about it now because sooner or later, probably sooner, we&#39;re going to actually
have to implement something.&#39; </p>
<p>So as early as the
beginning of 1776, states began considering what they should do about the
unsettled state of governance in their own colonies. And some colonies actually
wrote to the Continental Congress asking for advice on what they should do
about governance in their colony. And there were some people in the Continental
Congress that suggested: &#39;well, you guys should take some kind of an interim
measure; things aren&#39;t sorted out yet with England&#39; we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going
to happen -- sort of do something to tide you over until we figure out what&#39;s
coming next. But there were others who were more radical in their politics in
the Continental Congress who thought that the colonies actually should really
establish new political institutions, basically new constitutions. More
conservative Congressmen argued that adopting new forms of government would be
as good as declaring independence. Even if independence hadn&#39;t been declared,
if the colonies start creating their own constitutions, these conservatives are
arguing, that&#39;s just as good as saying you&#39;re independent and it&#39;s going to
make sort of reconciling with England even harder if you begin to do that. </p>
<p>Even so, in May of
1776, the Continental Congress adopted a resolution saying that colonial
assemblies should adopt new governments. And just as the conservatives in Congress
argued, certainly to John Adams and many others, that resolution was what
really was the instrument of American independence. That&#39;s--To Adams, he saw
that resolution as a really key turning point when the Continental Congress
said to the colonies becoming states, &#39;I think it&#39;s time that you should devise
your own constitutions.&#39; </p>
<p>Now it&#39;s important to
note, the Continental Congress wasn&#39;t in the lead here. What happened is that
colonies were asking them what to do and Congress sort of responded and figured
out what it thought and then made a recommendation. So states were thinking
about government before the Continental Congress necessarily did anything about
it. The first new constitution had already been drafted in New Hampshire in
January of 1776, making it the first written constitution drawn up by one of
the colonies without consultation with or approval of the Crown or Parliament.
So the states are all occupied with constitution-making, and that continued
through 1777. </p>
<p>Now at first, people
in the Congress were undecided about whether maybe it would be smart to
recommend to all of the colonies one model constitution; maybe they should come
up with one model, and sort of send it out and say, &#39;Here&#39;s what we think the
best kind of a government would be.&#39; But after a brief debate, the idea went
nowhere, and that&#39;s basically for two reasons. I think one of them is really
obvious, which is what is the likelihood that everybody in that Congress was
going to agree on what a model constitution ought to look like for all of the
states? Okay, not. On a purely pragmatic level, that would be very hard to do.
</p>
<p>But second and more
important than that, the Congress ultimately felt that people in each colony or
each state should really be adopting and devising their own governments that
really suited their own character, their own habits, their own specific needs
-- local conditions. So really, it was the colonies themselves who were best
suited. It wasn&#39;t a smart idea to the Congress ultimately for them to be
imposing a model anything, since part of the purpose of the Revolution was for
people to devise governments that suited them better. </p>
<p>And in making this
suggestion, that each colony should be free to create a constitution that
reflected their particular values and habits, the Congress was pretty much
acting in accordance with a prevailing belief at the time that there was, or
certainly that there should be, an intimate connection between the values of a
people -- between the habits of a people on the one hand and between their
instruments of government and systems of law on the other. It&#39;s a general
assumption. One shapes the other. One should shape the other. And that&#39;s part
of the assumption that the Continental Congress is acting on. </p>
<p>But just because
Congress didn&#39;t design a model constitution, it doesn&#39;t mean that individual
Continental congressmen didn&#39;t begin thinking about what ought to be happening
in their own states back home. And in fact, so many Continental congressmen
became so obsessed with the idea of state constitution-making for their own
states that some people feared that some of the basic demands of the Revolution
were falling by the wayside because everyone was saying, &#39;Oh, well, back home
they&#39;re making up a constitution. That&#39;s amazing and I have some ideas about
that. Maybe I should even go back there. Okay. Maybe not, but I&#39;ll send them
some ideas about what they ought to be doing.&#39; So these delegates in the
Continental Congress are extremely interested, for really obvious reasons, in
what&#39;s being devised back in their home colony, their home state. </p>
<p>One result of this
obsession with constitution-making was this pamphlet I mentioned a few moments
ago, which ends up being an important and influential pamphlet written by John
Adams that&#39;s titled <i>Thoughts on Government. </i>Now Adams had long been
really interested in constitutional issues, and he actually had something of a
reputation for being someone who was pretty knowledgeable on the subject. So
when these states began talking about new constitutions beginning at the very,
very end of 1775 going through 1776, several men from different states came to
him to ask his advice: &#39;Hey, you&#39;re the guy who knows a lot about
constitutions. What do you think we ought to be doing, Mr. Adams?&#39; So Adams --
so many people asked him, that he wrote up what he called a sketch of what a
new constitution might look like. And he gave the sketch out to a few people. &#39;Well,
you want to know what I think a new constitution ought to look like? Here you
go, my best idea.&#39; Well, obviously, if everyone&#39;s casting about like: &#39;I don&#39;t
know what to do, what should I say&#39; -- and one guy pipes up and says, &#39;I think
this is a pretty good idea,&#39; not surprisingly other people went to Adams and
said, &#39;Hey, I&#39;d like a copy of that sketch too. I&#39;d like to see what your model
constitution looks like.&#39; </p>
<p>So by April of 1776,
Adams had turned this sketch into this pamphlet. The full title of his pamphlet
is one of these great eighteenth-century titles, <i>Thoughts on Government
Applicable to the Present State of the American Colonies in a Letter From a
Gentleman to his Friend. </i>We can call it <i>Thoughts on Government. </i>[laughs]
Now besides the obvious practical use the pamphlet, and I&#39;m going to come back
to some of the things he recommends in a minute, Adams also intended it to be a
response to the concluding section of Thomas Paine&#39;s <i>Common Sense </i>published
a few months earlier. And you&#39;ll remember the wonderful opinion that John Adams
registered on <i>Common Sense, </i>quote, &quot;A poor ignorant, Malicious,
short-sighted, Crapulous Mass.&quot; [laughs] Thank you, John Adams. </p>
<p>So Adams basically
thought that that final section of <i>Common Sense </i>was irresponsible and
impractical; it was giving ideas about forming a new government that didn&#39;t
make sense. And if you remember, Paine had said that there should be a
unicameral -- a one-house legislature for each of the colonies, and that would
be--all of those would be subordinate to a unicameral legislature like the
Continental Congress. No level of government would have an independent
executive. So basically as Adams is thinking about it, Paine is just tossing
off separation of powers and the balance of powers and saying, Eh, we don&#39;t
need to think about that. We should be thinking about the people.&#39; Right? &#39;We
should be thinking about making a government responsive to people,&#39; which is a
nice idea, but Adams thought, in reality there&#39;s no way that that&#39;s going to
work. </p>
<p>Adams and others,
though they valued what Paine had to say obviously about independence, did not
appreciate that whole plan. And in <i>Thoughts on Government</i>,<i> </i>Adams
argued that whatever the states did with these new governments they should at
least preserve the best of Anglo-American traditions of government, and
particularly, separation of powers. Adams really did not like the idea of
having a one-house assembly and having no executive at all. He argued that
there was no way that that could work well; a one-house legislature would never
be effective; it could never do anything executive; it could never do anything
judicial. As he put it, a one-house legislature could not act as an executive
power, quote, &quot;for want of two essential properties, secrecy and despatch.&quot;
Okay. That&#39;s what executives need to be; no congress will ever manage those two
things. </p>
<p>He also said that a
one-house legislature couldn&#39;t be a judicial power because it was &quot;too
numerous, too slow, and too little skilled in the laws.&quot; And just as bad
to Adams, a unicameral legislature was just unstable in and of itself. As he put
it, it was &quot;liable to all the vices, follies, and frailties of an
individual; subject to fits of humor, starts of passion, flights of enthusiasm,
partialities, or prejudice, and consequently productive of hasty results and
absurd judgments.&quot; I think that sounds like a quote from a guy who&#39;s
really tired of being in congresses. He was like: &#39;I know what congresses do. [laughs]
This unicameral legislature, bad idea.&#39; </p>
<p>He really preferred a
bicameral legislature, both houses of which would elect a governor. The
governor would have a veto over legislation, and could appoint judges and some
other officers with the consent of the upper house. Judges would have tenure
for life during good behavior. And all officials apart from judges would be
elected annually to prevent an aristocratic ruling class from rising up, and to
keep politicians humble because they&#39;d have to go home every year and get
reelected, and to Adams that would successfully keep politicians humble.
Rotation in office would be something that would keep the right spirit of
government going. </p>
<p>Now it&#39;s hard to say
how much direct influence <i>Thoughts on Government</i> had. It&#39;s always very
hard. You always want to say, &#39;Wow. These five states were extremely
influenced.&#39; It&#39;s hard to say that, but the fact is that most of the state
constitutions ended up being in hailing distance of what Adams suggested in
that pamphlet and he did receive letters from a number of friends saying: &#39;well,
actually that was helpful. Thank you very much, John Adams. That was actually
very helpful.&#39; So we have this little moment in which John Adams must have been
smiling because he&#39;s getting recognition. Right? &#39;Yay.&#39; He&#39;s like: &#39;I wrote a
good pamphlet and they&#39;re saying thank you. Yay.&#39; Poor John Adams. </p>
<p>Okay. So, all this talking
about new governments. The fact is, as I suggested when Adams says we should be
preserving the best features of Anglo-American governance, these state
constitutions generally did preserve some basic features of Anglo-American
governance. So take for example a bicameral legislature, obviously resembling
Parliament&#39;s House of Commons and House of Lords. Obviously, America did not
have Lords and Commons in quite the same way, but the idea remained. You had
two houses and you had different sets of people in the two, although it was not
entirely clear what that meant in the American example, and this was actually a
source of confusion. </p>
<p>When the Constitution
first starts, with this new bicameral legislature, people aren&#39;t sure if the
Senate is kind of like a House of Lords, meaning that the people in the Senate
were sort of higher up than the representatives. Should they have special
privileges? Should there be--Should they get a higher salary? Are they &quot;special
people&quot; in comparison to the House? Should we really be making that kind
of difference between the House and the Senate? And you can see this
throughout this period. You can see it in somewhat ridiculous ways, but you can
see how people were so focused on it. </p>
<p>And one example of
this is from 1790 -- so one year of government -- and the Senate wrote some
kind of a bill, and they included I suppose names of people who had drafted the
bill, and before the names of the people they put &quot;the honorable,&quot;
like &quot;the honorable messieurs,&quot; and they sent this to the House. The
House got this bill. They didn&#39;t even look at the content of the bill. They
just looked at the bill. &#39;Why are the Senators calling themselves &quot;the
honorable?&quot; We don&#39;t like that. What&#39;s it suggesting about who they are?
Do they think they&#39;re better than us? No, they&#39;re not better than us.&#39; So the
House--before it votes on the content of the bill--votes to cut those two words
out. Right? That&#39;s not going to be on the document, none of this honorable
stuff. Then they pass it, and it goes back to the Senate, and the Senate passes
another amendment in which they take their names off the document because they
don&#39;t want them printed without &quot;the honorable&quot; attached to them.
Okay. A seemingly little, trivial, petty thing, but that clearly two parts of
the legislature were focused on, and there was even a letter from Madison--and
I can&#39;t remember who he was writing to--and he says, &#39;This seems trivial. [laughs]
It really isn&#39;t because it&#39;s getting down to these kind of basic questions, of
exactly what is the House and what is the Senate, and what&#39;s their relationship
to the House of Lords, the House of Commons.&#39; So a bicameral legislature is
one tradition that Americans held on to, generally speaking, and I&#39;m going to
come back to an exception. </p>
<p>A second traditional
assumption that was represented in the new state constitutions concerned the
need for property requirements for voting and for holding elected office. And
the reasoning there being, men who owned property were independent men, so they
could vote for themselves as they thought rather than being dependent on
someone else and thus maybe having to vote in a way that somebody else wanted
them to vote. And likewise it was thought that if you had literally financial
investment in a community, you were the people best qualified to affect that
community through elections. So though the Revolution would inspire many states
to reduce the level of the property requirement for voting, the fact is that
those kinds of restrictions remained in place. And on average, in the new state
constitutions, roughly there was an increase of fifteen percent in the number
of adult white males voting -- which in a sense, compared I suppose with
England, maybe seems a little bit--somewhat substantial, if not revolutionary
in scope. So that was held on to, as well, as something that people felt
comfortable with. It was a precedent, a tradition that made sense to them. </p>
<p>Now there were other
ways in which these constitutions--these state constitutions--rather than reflecting
traditions, Anglo-American traditions, instead more obviously reflected the
immediate impact of the Revolution. And the first and most obvious example of
that is the simple fact that they&#39;re writing constitutions. Right? Americans
were revealing their recognition of what they believed to be the instability
and lack of security in unwritten constitutions. As they looked at Great
Britain, they thought, we don&#39;t like that system very much. We want everything
in writing. We want it all on paper. Americans wanted to fix the principles of
their new governments in writing in a form that was distinct from and superior
to mere legal statutes. </p>
<p>You can also see the
immediate impact of the Revolution in the three main ideas that were at the
core of most of these state constitutions, three sort of basic ideas. Number
one, most of these constitutions were premised on the idea that they had to be
grounded on natural rights. And you can really see this belief reflected in the
declarations of rights that were appended to most state constitutions. And
again, there is a lot that&#39;s traditional in these reclarations of rights, because
a lot of the rights that are being declared in these declarations are
traditional English rights, but they&#39;re being put in--on paper in these
documents and then attached to these sort of constitutional statements creating
whatever these new states were going to be. Most of these declarations of rights
specified things like the right of trial by jury. Right? They thought back to
the Revolution. They remembered those Vice Admiralty courts, not popular, so now
they were like: &#39;okay, we want the right of trial by jury; we want the right
not to be deprived of life, liberty and property through the protection of due
process of law; freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and in some states
like Virginia, freedom of religion -- again, rights that are familiar to us,
rights that they&#39;re putting down on paper and attaching to constitutions at
this moment in time. So declarations of rights were shared by constitutions,
this sort of idea that there are these natural rights that need to be written
down and memorialized, one of the things that all of these state constitutions
generally share. </p>
<p>The other two main
ideas that were at the core of these constitutions are related. So these--the
last two ideas are: most constitutions declared that representation is based on
consent, again, obviously coming right out of the Revolution; consent is
important in the process of representation. And then the third and last basic
idea related to that is -- and maybe it&#39;s the most central one of all --
sovereignty rests with the people; the people are sovereign. As the Virginia Constitution
declared, and a lot of the other states in one way or another rephrased it, but
said something like it: &quot;all power is vested in, and consequently derived
from, the people; that [the] magistrates are their trustees and servants, and
at all times amenable to them.&quot; The main question about this was, as John
Adams put it at the time, &quot;to what extent shall we carry this principle?&quot;
Like, &#39;nice idea. What does that exactly mean? How is it going to actually
boil down into what people are actually doing? How beholden should the
government be to the people?&#39; </p>
<p>And this varied in
different states depending on a number of different kinds of factors. One
dramatic way in which you could really see the sovereignty of the people being
emphasized in these new state constitutions is through the way in which they
curbed executive power. They curbed the power of state governors. They made
state governors less important. They usually made the lower house of their
legislatures more important. They often made the upper house of their
legislatures less important. They&#39;re really trying to limit power, to curb power.
Again, that&#39;s obviously really connected to what they had just experienced in
the Revolution, which felt to them like this sort of monarchical unlimited
power that they had no control over. So they&#39;re really worried about executive
power, fear of a concentration of power, fear of executive power like the power
of the monarch that they had just--or were at least, were in the process of
breaking away from. So as I said, almost every new state constitution increased
the power of the lower house, decreased the power of the governor, decreased
the power of the upper house of their legislatures. </p>
<p>And, as we&#39;ll see in
a moment, the national government that ends up being created under the Articles
of Confederation follows the same general pattern. They just eliminate
executive, and they don&#39;t have a judicial branch either. So basically,
everyone&#39;s really scared of executive power, of centralized power at this
point. Okay. So summing up what I&#39;ve just been discussing, in essence: Most
new state constitutions shared a few basic institutional features. They had a
bicameral legislature. They had a weak executive. They had rotation in office.
They had--As far as principles go, a lot of them at least had declarations of
rights; the idea that representation should be based on consent; that the
government rests on the people -- that the people are sovereign; a somewhat
broader electorate voting in annual elections. </p>
<p>Now that said, the
most extreme constitutional revisions actually took place in Pennsylvania, and
Pennsylvania is really where the constitution ultimately reflected the most
radical impulses of the Revolution. The new Pennsylvania constitution had no
property requirements for voting, it had a one-house legislature, and it had
some special features that clearly, to the people who were devising that
constitution, were aimed at making the government as responsible to popular
consent as possible. So for example--and this is kind of wild to me. Imagine
how many laws would actually pass if this is the case. For a law to become a
law in Pennsylvania, a bill had to be passed in two consecutive sessions of the
legislature, so a bill had to be passed twice. So--and between those two
sessions, the politicians who were passing the bill had to go home and explain
it to their constituents. So you would pass a law. The representatives would go
to their constituents and explain why they liked it, and then they&#39;d have to go
back and pass it again. Right? Obviously, the idea being: okay, these people
are really beholden to their constituents and nothing&#39;s going to happen unless
the constituents really approve of it. </p>
<p>The Pennsylvania
constitution also created this nifty little sort of body called the Council of Censors,
and this Council of Censors was kind of like a big grand jury. It would be
elected every seven years. And the job of the Council of Censors was to
evaluate all aspects of government action. So basically, they create this
little body, and the job of it is to just police government and make sure that
everything is above board and operating in the way it&#39;s supposed to be
operating. So you can really see, in comparison with what I was just saying
about the sort of generality of these state constitutions, Pennsylvania really
has an extreme reaction to the experience of the Revolution against what the
colonists perceive to be as tyranny. So in a sense, if you think of ideas about
government as being kind of a pendulum, and on one end you&#39;ve got sort of
British monarchical centralized power, in Pennsylvania, boy, that pendulum went
way over onto the other side. Like, &#39;we don&#39;t want any centralized executive
power; we are just going to be over here sort of experimenting with this
interesting government that we haven&#39;t ever had one like it before.&#39; And, as
we&#39;ll see as we look at what happens over the next ten, fifteen, seventeen
years, the Constitution in a way represents a midpoint between these two ends
of the spectrum. </p>
<p>One last point I want
to discuss about state constitutions before we get into the Articles. While
all of this state constitution revision was taking place, there were actually
two states that were not taking part in it, not out of protest but because
their colonial charters actually had in a sense been more radical than the
other colonies&#39; to begin with, and of course they are Connecticut and Rhode
Island. Continuing theme, Connecticut and Rhode Island. Their colonial charters
had basically made them self-governing already in--on a certain level. So they
didn&#39;t have to do dramatic changes to make them into state constitutions. So
they basically--Rhode Island and Connecticut--basically preserved their
colonial charters as constitutions and didn&#39;t really change them until into the
nineteenth century. </p>
<p>Okay. That gets us
out of the world of state constitutions and into the world of creating some
kind of government for the new union of American states, and that ends up being
the Articles of Confederation. Now on July 12, 1776, just after they had
declared independence, the Continental Congress also was trying to create some
kind of a proposal for a new national government. And between 1776 and 1777,
the Continental Congress drafted the Articles of Confederation. </p>
<p>And the Articles are
the document that literally created the United States of America. They
literally gave that name to the United States of America, but it&#39;s important
that--to note that they actually meant that really literally. We sort of don&#39;t
think of what that phrase means, but it was meant really literally. In the
context of what I&#39;m talking about now, what that said was: this was not one
consolidated nation. This was &quot;united states &quot;--what the articles
created; it united some states together. That&#39;s what that phrase literally
meant. As John Adams explained later, they never thought &quot;of consolidating
this vast Continent under one national Government&quot; but instead erected &quot;a
Confederacy of States, each of which must have a separate Government.&quot; So
when thirteen free and independent states had defeated England and now had to
figure out how to come together, they were not thinking of one big unified
republic at this point. They really definitely were not, and that&#39;s--the
Articles of Confederation went along with that thinking. It did not create one
unified government; it did not bond people together in anything other than a
loose league. The Articles created a loose league of individual republican
governments. </p>
<p>Now if, as the
founding generation assumed, absolute power corrupts absolutely, then the
Articles of Confederation was a very virtuous form of government because under
the Articles, the Confederation Congress had almost no power to enforce its
will at all. The newly-created Confederation was almost more of a United Nations
than a central governing institution. As the Articles themselves stated, they
were intended to create, quote, &quot;a firm league of friendship ... for their
common defense, the security of their Liberties, and their mutual and general
welfare.&quot; The Articles were basically a pact between thirteen sovereign
states which agreed that certain powers would be delegated to this new central
government for very specific purposes, but these thirteen sovereign states
retained all powers not expressly delegated by them in the Articles. </p>
<p>So under the Articles,
the national government consisted of a one-chamber national Congress elected by
the state legislatures. Each state had one vote. Congress could request funds
from the states but it could not enact a tax of its own without every state&#39;s
approval--how likely is that to happen?--so it could not really make its own
taxes. It could not regulate interstate commerce between the states. The Articles
did not provide for any kind of an executive branch or any kind of an executive
character at all. Instead, Congressional Committees oversaw anything having to
do with finance or diplomacy or military affairs. There was no judicial system
by which this new national government could compel allegiance to its laws. </p>
<p>So basically as far
as the powers of Congress were concerned, the Confederation Congress was kind
of filling the place of the imperial system. It could regulate foreign affairs.
It could declare war with foreign countries. It could negotiate peace treaties.
It could fix standards for weights and measures. It could manage Indian
affairs. It could borrow money although it couldn&#39;t really tax. Basically, the Confederation
Congress had power over war and foreign affairs and the states maintained
control over what they called &quot;internal policing.&quot; </p>
<p>Now it&#39;s important to
realize that in the context of the time when they were created, the Articles of
Confederation actually make perfect sense. I think it&#39;s really easy--and I&#39;ll
talk a little bit more about this on Thursday -- I think it&#39;s really easy to
look at the Articles and say, &#39;Huh? What were they thinking? How did that
make sense? Let&#39;s create a government and give it no power. Go.&#39; So I think
the Articles get a bum rap basically, in the long view of history. And I think
it&#39;s important to realize at that moment in time they made perfect sense, given
the experience of the Revolution and what people had just experienced in the
realm of government. </p>
<p>Basically, the Articles
denied to this new government the very powers and violations that they had seen
at the heart of the Revolution. So the Congress can&#39;t tax; the Congress can&#39;t
overrule local laws; the Congress can&#39;t alter a state constitution; it can&#39;t
interfere with state judicial proceedings. All of these things are things that
we saw in past weeks happening during the course of the Revolution, inflicted
by the British. So this is a really--Again and again, when people are creating
constitutions, they learn a lesson and then they act based on that lesson that
they learned, and then they look at this new thing they created and go: &#39;okay,
new lesson learned. Let&#39;s make another government because we didn&#39;t like that
one so much.&#39; But you can actually see people experiencing something, thinking
about what that means, and then creating a government based on those immediate
lessons. That&#39;s what we see here with the Articles of Confederation. </p>
<p>And then to avoid an
entrenched elite--They don&#39;t want any kind of a little aristocracy coming up in
America--the Articles did establish rotation in office. So you could not be in
office more than three or every six years; you couldn&#39;t be President of Congress
more than one in any three years; and any delegate could be instantly recalled
by his home state. Okay. So there we see this weak central government, lots of
things it can&#39;t do. </p>
<p>There were very, very
few things that the states were restricted from doing under this new compact,
but there were a couple of things that the states were not supposed to do--and
you&#39;ll hear, they&#39;re not exactly dire restrictions. Okay. So no state could
enter into an alliance or treaty with a foreign nation without the consent of Congress,
so New Jersey cannot make a treaty with France. Okay. They need to go through Congress.
No two or more states could enter into a confederation without the consent of Congress.
Okay. Think about that one. So New England can&#39;t break away and form its own
confederation without at least checking with us first. Would you allow us to
break off and form our own confederation? No? That would have been an
interesting little game. No? Well, try to stop us. But at least it&#39;s saying,
states are not supposed to form their own little mini-confederations. States
were not to keep warships or troops in peacetime unless Congress deemed it
necessary for defense. States were not supposed to declare war without consent
of Congress--that&#39;s nice--except where sudden invasion admitted of no delay. </p>
<p>Okay. Those are the
restraints. Right? Ooh, [laughs] those are not dire restraints. Don&#39;t make war
with another country all by yourself. Don&#39;t break away from the Articles, from
the league of friendship, and form your own little country. Don&#39;t make a treaty
with a foreign nation all by yourself. Those are the restrictions on the
states. Obviously, none of these restraints placed too serious a check on the
sovereignty of the states under this compact. </p>
<p>So essentially the
Articles of Confederation were designed so that the new nation&#39;s central
government would not infringe on the states. As I said before, it would kind of
fill the hole where the British imperial system had been before, have a very,
very limited sphere of actions, not really have a power of enforcement, and
leave everything that wasn&#39;t specified to the states to control on their own.
Now, this is a document that&#39;s being drafted in the middle of a revolution, and
what we&#39;re going to see over the course of the next few lectures is that once
revolutions end--Remember we started the course by talking about how the
colonies came together basically when they needed to defend themselves and then
as soon as they didn&#39;t need to defend themselves they went &quot;boom&quot; and
sort of parted. </p>
<p>Okay. So we had this Revolution,
and the states, the colonies, they come together, they unite, they fight
together, and then the war ends, so guess what the 1780s is going to look like.
Okay. It&#39;s going to look like just what you think it will look like. The states
basically all turn their back on each other and say, &#39;Well, that was nice. [laughs]
Now we&#39;re going to do our own thing. Thank you very much.&#39; So the Articles is
drafted in a time when there is this cooperation going on between the states. </p>
<p>What we&#39;re going to
see in the next two lectures is what happens when these Articles actually go
into effect. What do the 1780s look like? And that&#39;s going to take us on the
road to new lessons being learned and yet another government. Think about the
pace at which governments are being created in this period. It gets back to
where I started at the beginning of this lecture. They&#39;re just: &#39;Hey, we need
a new government. Let&#39;s make one now. Okay. How do you like that one? I don&#39;t
know. We need to revise it.&#39; They&#39;re also revising these governments throughout
this period. That&#39;s also got to be a little unsettling. It&#39;s part of why in
this period, people tend to get very upset, very scared. Something goes a
little wrong and they think, &#39;Aah, it&#39;s the end of the government!&#39; Well, if
it&#39;s only two years old, maybe it will collapse, and if these are the guys who
actually made the government, then they kind of have a good reason for thinking
that it could fall apart. They were there when they put it together. Maybe it&#39;s
actually going to collapse. </p>
<p>So that&#39;s actually--And
we&#39;re going to see that particularly in the 1780s and then the 1790s. We won&#39;t
be talking so much about the 1790s. If you want to take my Early National
America course, that will start right where this one drops off actually, and
takes us into the 1790s -- but you can see that spirit in the 1790s, of people
saying, &#39;Wow. We&#39;ve been creating a lot of governments. Do you think this one&#39;s
going to stick around? I don&#39;t know. I hope so. Maybe it&#39;ll last for five
years. That&#39;ll be exciting.&#39; So--Okay. I will stop there. On Thursday we will
look at what happened when the Articles go into effect. </p>
