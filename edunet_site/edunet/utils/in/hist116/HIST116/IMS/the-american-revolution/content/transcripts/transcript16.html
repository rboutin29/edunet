<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>On
to the topic of today&#39;s lecture, and today&#39;s lecture is: the importance of
George Washington. We&#39;re going to be talking about George Washington today. And
in a sense, what I&#39;m going to be talking about is exactly what it sounds like
I&#39;m going to be talking about, which is looking at what in a sense you could
call the phenomenon of George Washington, right? His reputation--his exalted
reputation--and importance during his lifetime, and some of the reasons why
both of those things were true. What is it that he was doing, or what was it
about him, that made him stand out in the way that he did then and actually in
a sense forever after? But we&#39;re going to be looking really during his lifetime,
what was it about Washington that made him stand out. </p>
<p>And in a sense, this
lecture sort of represents a little bit of a turn in this course as a whole,
because you&#39;ll be getting a sense of Washington today, and that will be important
to have sort of under our belts for the next two lectures after this, because
then we will actually be looking at fighting battles and such. We will actually
be looking at how the war was fought in a really literal way, so obviously I
want us all to have a sense of George before we venture up and watch to see
what George is doing as the war gets under way. So I&#39;ve divided that into two
lectures. It&#39;s--Thursday and Tuesday is when we&#39;ll be talking about how the war
was fought, and then in the end really how the war was won--and today is kind
of the segue lecture. </p>
<p>I also want to
mention something because by dumb luck it was in the <i>New York Times </i>this
morning and I was reading it and it&#39;s--hardly ever do I read the <i>New York
Times </i>and say, &quot;Oh, I must mention that in my American Revolution
course,&quot; but it happened today. In the Arts section, I guess, there&#39;s an
article on a collection. Did any of you see this? Did any of you happen to
look at the <i>New York Times? </i>Nobody. Wow. I feel so informed. [laughs]
There was an article in the arts section on a collection of letters between
British military figures and sort of--and officials to each other, not back to
the officials in London but the newspaper, the <i>Times, </i>calls them sort of
back-channel letters from throughout the Revolutionary War. </p>
<p>And what&#39;s
interesting about the letters: It&#39;s not new information but it&#39;s sort of
wonderfully ground-level information. It&#39;s all of these people writing to each
other from throughout the war in one way or another saying, &#39;Oh, we&#39;re in big
trouble,&#39; [laughs] --the British from very early on in the war saying, &#39;I don&#39;t
know.&#39; So at the same time that they&#39;re writing back to London and reporting, &#39;Our
military forces are strong and we are supreme and we will of course win this
war for the greater glory of Britain and the colonies will be back to where
they should be,&#39; they&#39;re writing to each other and saying, &#39;I don&#39;t know. What
do you think about this? Because this is really tricky, and I don&#39;t know if
we&#39;re going to be able to do it. I don&#39;t know if we can get enough men here.
Logistically, this is a disaster. They hate us. It&#39;s hard to be hated.&#39; It&#39;s
all these really interesting letters. </p>
<p>I&#39;m sure you can go
find it online but--and I&#39;ll mention it more when I&#39;m actually talking about
the war and why the British are doing what they&#39;re doing and the logic behind
what the Americans are doing,--but I thought it was actually really interesting
that by just dumb luck that appeared today. And again, it&#39;s something that--It&#39;s
not a new realization, but it&#39;s an interesting thing to be reminded of, that as
powerful as the British Army is and as much as you would assume at the time
they would assume things are going to go swimmingly and we&#39;re going to just
sweep this up in no time, there are all these sort of back-channel letters of
people on the ground who are actually in a sense being very realistic about it
and saying, &#39;This is really hard. This is really tricky. I don&#39;t know if this
is going to work&#39;--throughout the war in really sometimes sort of bemused and
sometimes really depressed tones. But anyway, more on that to come. </p>
<p>For now I want us to
turn to George Washington. Now, as a historian I have to admit that this kind
of lecture sometimes might make me nervous, because as a historian it makes me
nervous to declare that one person was crucial. That&#39;s the kind of declaration
historians don&#39;t like to make. They like to say, &#39;Oh, well, history&#39;s
complicated. Events are complicated. They unfold in complicated ways&#39;--and all
of that is true. That said, in many ways Washington actually was crucial not
just to the Revolutionary War effort but equally if not more important, as
we&#39;re going to see later in the course, to the launching of the new government
under the Constitution. </p>
<p>I&#39;ll talk a little
bit more about that in the last lectures of this course--but in one way or
another Washington ends up being really crucial in this period, and one of the
central reasons why that&#39;s true-- and it&#39;s a theme I&#39;m going to come back to at
a few different points in a few different ways in the lecture today--is because
people trusted him with power. We&#39;re going to look today partly at why they
trust him with power--but in one way or another throughout this period people
trusted him with power, and in an age and among a people who were really wary
about power, about tyranny, about where power was being placed, this is a very
big deal to be the person that people trust with power. It matters a lot. </p>
<p>And in a sense, the
deployment of power, the holding of power, being entrusted with power, is sort
of the central crucial issue with Washington&#39;s importance. I think--again--the Revolution
and the presidency have sort of this key thing about him that makes him
different. Really, he is in many ways--particularly when he becomes the first
President--the only person people could think of trusting in that role of
having extreme power. And part of what I&#39;m going to be talking about today is
why? Why is that true? Why is he such a trusted character? What did he do to be
so trusted? And it&#39;s--something he&#39;s particularly skilled at is not just
holding positions of power but managing to have power while also calming
people&#39;s fears about what that power might mean. </p>
<p>Okay. Now in a sense
when we think about Washington, Washington--I always feel he gets sort of
gypped in the long run with history, not because we don&#39;t remember him or not
because we don&#39;t honor George Washington, but because he&#39;s sort of a nonperson.
He&#39;s sort of this block of marble who sort of glides through history like: &#39;well,
yeah, I fought a war, became the President, went home and died.&#39; George
Washington, the guy--he doesn&#39;t get to be a real person. He&#39;s just sort of
almost a symbol to us--and then I suppose that even at the time in some ways,
as we&#39;re going to hear in the end of the lecture, even then he&#39;s a little bit
of a symbol--but we don&#39;t think of him very often as a person with insecurities
and ambitions, as a person with political savvy--he actually was very
politically savvy--as a person with specific political ideas and ideals, right?
We don&#39;t tend to even attribute many ideas to him at all. We just think of him
as capital &quot;L&quot; leader, but in fact he&#39;s all of these things. He is a
person and all that that entails. </p>
<p>That said, even
during his lifetime, he was already being shaped into a legend. Right? The
title &quot;Father of His Country&quot; is a title that was given to him even
before the country finally existed. The Revolution&#39;s not over yet, and some
people are calling him Father of His Country, so this happens pretty--at a
pretty early point to Washington, that he ascends into this position. </p>
<p>Now as I&#39;m sure
you&#39;ve gathered by this time in the course, John Adams is a little jealous of
other people who appear to be getting the glory, credit, and fame that he
thinks he deserves, and not surprisingly he&#39;s a little irked at Washington&#39;s
incredible sort of renown and status and fame and how beloved he is, as it
developed between the Revolution and the 1790s. To Adams, Washington is just so
revered--and he writes this letter. I&#39;m going to read a piece of it here. Once
again, Benjamin Rush, who keeps appearing and disappearing in this course. He
and Adams write these amazing--Just in the same way that Jefferson and Adams
write amazing letters in their old age, Adams and Rush do the same thing. They
write these really great letters to each other. They&#39;re published in a book
called <i>The Spur of Fame, </i>I think is the name of it. They&#39;re really
fascinating and really interesting and this is one of them. </p>
<p>And Adams writes it
in 1807, so it&#39;s a few years after Washington died--he died in 1799--and
they&#39;re talking about Washington clearly in an exchange of letters here. And
Adams--Clearly one of the things that irks him is that Washington wasn&#39;t as
book-learned as Adams and many of their contemporaries were. Right? He&#39;s
someone who doesn&#39;t have a formal education. He&#39;s not thinking about Aristotle.
He&#39;s not thinking about the things that Adams thinks people should be thinking
about if they&#39;re great statesmen. </p>
<p>So here in this
letter he tries to come up with the top ten talents that Washington had that
made him great, none of them having anything to do with book learning. Right?
It&#39;s like, okay, so if he doesn&#39;t have book learning, what are the top ten
talents? It&#39;s David Letterman-esque: the top ten talents of George Washington
that made him so great. So this is Adams&#39; description: &quot;Talents! you will
say, what Talents? I answer. 1. An handsome Face. [laughter] That this is a Talent,
I can prove by the authority of a thousand Instances in all ages.... 2. A tall
stature, like the Hebrew sovereign chosen because he was taller by the Head
than the other Jews. 3. An elegant Form.&quot; [laughter] You can see where
this is going. </p>
<p>&quot;4. Graceful Attitudes
and Movements. 5. A large imposing Fortune consisting of a great landed Estate
left him by his Father and Brother ... and in addition to this immense tracts
of land of his own acquisition. There is nothing, except bloody Battles and
splendid Victories to which Mankind bowed down with more reverence than to
great fortune. ... 6. Washington was a Virginian. This is equivalent to five Talents.
[laughter] Virginian Geese are all Swans. Not a Bearne in Scotland is more
national, not a Lad upon the High Lands is more clannish than every Virginian I
have ever known. ... 7. Washington was preceded by favorable Anecdotes. The
English had used him ill in the expedition of Braddock [during the French and
Indian War]. They had not done Justice to his Bravery and good Council. They
had exaggerated and misrepresented his defeat. . .which interested the Pride as
well as compassion of Americans in his favour. ... 8. He possessed the Gift of
Silence. This I esteem as one of the most precious Talents.&quot; </p>
<p>I think that&#39;s partly
because Adams does not possess the gift of silence. [laughs] </p>
<p>&quot;9. He had great
Self Command. It cost him a great exertion sometimes, and a constant Constraint,
but to preserve so much equanimity as he did, required a great Capacity. 10. Whenever
he lost his temper as he did sometimes, either Love or fear in those about him
induced them to conceal his Weakness from the World. Here you see I&#39;ve made out
ten Talents without saying a word about Reading, Thinking or writing.&quot; </p>
<p>Ooh, thank you, John
Adams. Okay. So he&#39;s being a little bit snarky in that letter, saying that
Washington looked like and behaved like a great leader and was from Virginia,
and so he was treated like a great leader. </p>
<p>There was actually some
truth to what he&#39;s saying. I&#39;m going to talk a little bit about that today. And,
as Adams suggests, it&#39;s true that Washington didn&#39;t have the same sort of
formal education that someone like Jefferson or Madison or even Adams had, but
he was more than a man who just looked the part. Now it is true that in some
ways Washington was sort of like any other Virginia gentleman. As Adams says,
he&#39;s a large landowner. He had inherited his estate, Mount Vernon, from his
father and then enlarged it himself. Like a lot of other Virginia gentlemen he
was a skilled horseman, which was a very prized skill in Virginia. You probably
remember or maybe you might remember earlier in the course I talked about
William Maclay sitting next to a Virginian at a dinner party and saying that
all they talked about was cockfighting and horses and alcohol. Horses are in
there in the top three. So horse--being a good horseman was very valued and
Washington--some called him &quot;the finest horseman in the country&quot;--so
he was impressive as--I think I--Did I mention--I did mention last time at
Mount Vernon when I saw him on that horse and said, &quot;My, he&#39;s impressive
on the horse,&quot; and then basically repeated what I&#39;d read a thousand times
in everyone else&#39;s letters. He really looked impressive on the horse. He did. I
can vouch. </p>
<p>A somewhat less
impressive but expected one: Washington was a good dancer. Things you never
knew about George Washington: he was a good dancer, which sounds seemingly
trivial, but again as a gentleman generally and as a Virginian specifically
being a good dancer is a way--another way of sort of publicly displaying your
superior breeding. Adams mentions grace, dignity--all of these things that
would make a gentleman noticeable and someone who would seem to be superior.
Dancing is one of them and luckily he was a good dancer and he liked dancing--not
the image we have of George. </p>
<p>Also like other
gentlemen of the time, Virginian and otherwise, Washington was ambitious. And
this is going to come up again. He doesn&#39;t necessarily always look ambitious,
but he was ambitious. He did want to earn status and reputation. He was
ambitious to better himself. During the French and Indian War, he struggled to
raise himself within the ranks of the army, and for the entirety of his life he
was very focused on protecting and preserving his reputation. He talks about it
a lot. When he makes a big decision about should I do this or should I not do
this, it&#39;s clearly--part of that decision is what will this do to my reputation?
</p>
<p>And Alexander
Hamilton, who served in one way or another at Washington&#39;s side for many years--first
as an aide during the war and then as Washington&#39;s first Secretary of the
Treasury--Hamilton is someone who really knew that if you wanted to get
Washington to do something you played the reputation card. Right? &#39;Well, if you
don&#39;t do this, Sir, it may affect your reputation.&#39; [laughter] And so one way
or another, if it might affect his reputation, Washington&#39;s going to take it
very seriously--so he very much thought about what anything that he did would
do to his reputation. And what that actually means is, when he does take these
positions of great power and responsibility, he&#39;s earning reputation, he&#39;s also
risking reputation, and I think he realizes both things. I&#39;ll come back to that
momentarily. </p>
<p>Okay. So a large
landowner, skilled horseman, good dancer, ambitious, protective of his
reputation. All of these things would have been true of many gentlemen from
throughout this period. And plus, of course --this is obvious but worth stating because
we forget it when we talk about Washington--like any other gentleman of the
period Washington was human. Right? He could be self-interested. He could be
gloomy. He could get excited. He was all of these things at various points
during the war and after. He sometimes doubted himself. He got bored. He got
tired of all the pomp and ceremony that basically surrounded him for the last twenty-five
years of his life. </p>
<p>There&#39;s a story of
him as President; he really didn&#39;t like all the pomp surrounding him as
President, and there are several stories actually, more than one. He was seen
giving a ceremonial dinner as President, sitting at the head of the table at
this formal dinner, staring into space and sort of banging a piece of
silverware on the table, [whistles]--so not wanting to be there and so
uninterested in what was going on. Again, he&#39;s all of these things, including
human as other gentlemen all were. But there is something about Washington that
was different and in a sense, there had to be something different to put him in
the exalted position of being quite literally, as one of his friends said at
his death, &quot;first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his
countrymen.&quot; </p>
<p>So how can we explain
the phenomenon of George Washington? And what I&#39;m going to talk about here in
the answer basically is an answer with three parts. The first part, as we&#39;re
about to see, has to do with Washington personally. He&#39;s a man who was
extremely skilled at shaping his public image, at controlling himself and
presenting to the world what he wanted them to see. Related to that, so part of
that same thing, he was very skilled at sizing up a situation and figuring out
just what sort of statement or action it required. He was often a really
brilliant political strategist and a lot of people during his lifetime and after
praised his good judgment. He had--That&#39;s always the word they used: He had
good judgment. He was someone who could survey the opinions of lots of people,
ask all of his advisers for advice. They often, more often than not, had
conflicting advice. He would take it under advisement. He&#39;d consider things for
himself. He&#39;d come to a conclusion and he&#39;d act on it in a way that everyone
always thought was calm, considered, thoughtful. He was someone who had good
judgment and didn&#39;t act impulsively. So one reason for the phenomenon of
Washington, as I&#39;ll talk about in a moment here, has to do with his
self-presentation and concrete skills in presenting himself as a leader. </p>
<p>The second way in
which he earned his reputation has to do really with the simple fact that he&#39;s
the right person with the right talents, at the right place, at the right time.
People often, when they look at this time period, in one way or another they
ask the question, &#39;Well, why in this period were there so many great men? What
was it about this period that you have Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Madison?
Why all then?&#39; And I think part of the answer has to do with the right people
in the right place at the right time. I&#39;ve talked earlier in the course about
how, as young men, this is a generation of people who were trained by reading
things like <i>Plutarch&#39;s Lives </i>to think that one of the sort of noblest
and grandest things you could ever do is to be the founder of a nation, to be a
great statesman. </p>
<p>So you have a
generation of young men who are trained to think that that&#39;s true, and then
that generation happens to be there when there&#39;s a nation being founded. That&#39;s
sort of a great--For them, it&#39;s great, and they see that. They understand: &#39;oh,
my gosh, this is the greatest thing I can do and I can do it. Who knew?&#39; So
you have these people who had somewhat limited horizons. Maybe they were going
to be a lawyer or they would serve in public service in their own colony, and
suddenly the horizon opens and they&#39;re able to be nation-founders, and they
know it and they rise to the occasion to promote themselves and to do public
good, to do both things at the same time, take advantage of the opportunity and
act. And so it&#39;s partly why so many great men--It&#39;s partly--You have people who
understand the significance of what&#39;s happening and act in that capacity to do
what they&#39;ve been trained to think is good to do, which is you do great acts of
service for your state, you become a great statesman and you earn immortal
fame. So you do great things for your country and you get to be famous. They
both happen sort of at the same time, so it&#39;s sort of selfless and
self-interested at the same time. So Washington also, like many people in this
era, is the right person with the right talents at the right time, but he has
very specific talents that are really well suited to this moment in time. </p>
<p>And then finally, the
third reason for the Washington phenomenon is kind of a combination of the
previous two, and that&#39;s basically the idea that during the prime years of
Washington&#39;s life, Americans lost a king and needed some other figure of
central importance to fill this vacuum of national leadership, some other
leader who they could honor as sort of the symbolic core of their new nation. And
Washington, because of who he was, because of who he presented himself as
being, because of what he did, because of the ways in which he tried
deliberately to conform with prevailing feelings about leadership and about
doing things like leading armies, he really ends up being the right man for
that job. So for all of those reasons, Washington ends up being the Father of
His Country even before the country is officially a country, when it&#39;s still
fighting its war. </p>
<p>So let&#39;s turn now to
those three reasons. Let&#39;s start with reason number one, which is Washington
and self-presentation, and in a way this is along--this is similar not only
what Adams said, but you&#39;ll hear Adams echoed in some of what I&#39;m going to be
talking about here. Now, in a general way, this is true that Washington
presented himself well as a leader, and in a general way--by that I mean in a
very specific way--he just looked and acted like a Commander-in-Chief. He was a
very tall and imposing physical presence. He&#39;s a big man, tall for the time,
also just apparently big-boned. He&#39;s just a big, imposing figure, very powerful
looking, who also managed to be graceful in his movements, as Adams said. So
he&#39;s someone who&#39;s strong, big, powerful, and also seems in command of himself
physically, so he was just imposing to look at. </p>
<p>That&#39;s a natural gift,
but Washington had other much more deliberate self-conscious aspects of his
self-presentation as a leader that really served him well. And as Adams sort of
hints, one of them is his self-control, which was remarkable, and he really was
controlling his passions for most of the time. Now, I will say that any
gentleman of the period would have been expected to display self-command or
self-control as a sign of his superior character, and the ultimate example of
that of course is dueling. Right? Gentlemen are the ones supposedly who duel in
this time period, and part of what you&#39;re doing when you duel is you&#39;re showing
that you&#39;re willing to risk your life to defend your honor by standing on the
field of honor against someone who is going to be shooting at you. And you need
to have complete self-command and mastery of your passions and stand there
dispassionately, allowing this other person to shoot at you. Right? That&#39;s the
ultimate example of what they would have considered in this period to be
gentlemanly self-command or self-control. </p>
<p>For Washington
self-command was particularly important, because as Adams suggested, he really
did have a pretty impressive temper. He kept it under control most of the time,
but he did lose his temper on a number of occasions, and the reason why we know
that is people who were there and saw it were very impressed and they usually
wrote it down like: &#39;ooh, [laughs] guess what happened today?&#39; So people tend
to take note because it was impressive, scary. He was a big guy and he would
just--when he lost his temper he really lost his temper. A great example of it--It
happens a number of times through the Revolution and I actually went off
looking to see if I could find a very specific example--couldn&#39;t find one that
I had enough specific information on to offer, so I&#39;m going to offer this other
one, only because I have a quote associated with it, and it&#39;s a story that
always makes me happy. So even though it&#39;s from his presidency, it&#39;s the same
George. </p>
<p>There&#39;s an instance
of Washington really, really just losing it during a cabinet meeting in which
one of his cabinet members came in with a cartoon from a newspaper making fun
of Washington, and Washington just lost it. He just--He didn&#39;t like being President.
Everyone was making fun of him. He just lost control and literally went into a
screaming rant: &#39;I never wanted this job. I never wanted this job from the
moment I took this job and I&#39;ve never wanted it at any moment since&#39;--just
screaming ranting. We know this of course because Thomas Jefferson took notes
on it, right? [laughter] like, &#39;you won&#39;t believe&#39;--and it&#39;s his personal notes
but he took--he wrote down his version of what he heard. But my favorite part
is --apparently this was a really impressive rant, and in Jefferson&#39;s notes he
describes the rant, and then at the end of the rant he writes in his notes, &#39;An
awkward silence ensued&#39; [laughter] and then ends, &#39;some difficulty resuming our
conversation.&#39; [laughter] And you could just hear--You could just--It just feels
like you&#39;re in the room like: &#39;okay, [laughs] now what do we do? Can we go
home? [laughs] You&#39;re scary, George. You scared us.&#39; </p>
<p>Okay. So mastering
your passion is vital for anyone to be a trusted and admired leader. For Washington,
considering his temper, it&#39;s very important and he did master his feelings, his
temper, most of the time, but he did more than just try not to display his
temper. He actually tried to suppress any sign of his feelings. He didn&#39;t want
people to be able to read him. He actually wanted to appear sort of
dispassionate, someone that you couldn&#39;t tell what he was thinking. And he
apparently did that reasonably well, but also, it&#39;s clear that he did it
really, really deliberately, because there is an account of someone who went to
visit him towards the end of his presidency and supposedly commented to
Washington, &#39;My, Sir, you look eager to get back to Mount Vernon,&#39; and
Washington replied, No. &quot;My countenance never yet betrayed my feelings.&quot;
Right? You don&#39;t know I&#39;m looking forward to getting back to Mount Vernon. You
can&#39;t tell what I&#39;m feeling on my face. [laughter] &#39;Okay. Yes, Sir.&#39; [laughs]
But clearly, he&#39;s trying to present a version of himself probably--maybe
successfully or not successfully--but largely some of the time successfully, as
this sort of dispassionate, in-command, in-control kind of a leader. </p>
<p>He knew how to
present and preserve his dignity, and when you joined that with his very
imposing appearance, his self-command made him a rather intimidating figure. He
is someone who many, many people felt intimidated by. A great story that I have
to tell--I can&#39;t resist a good story. Basically, as I&#39;m writing these lectures
I&#39;m like: oh, this means I can tell this story, and then I write it right into
the lecture. This is just a famous example which--well, or a pseudo example. It
may have happened, it may not have happened, but it&#39;s a famous story, which
I&#39;ll tell anyway with the sort of proviso that maybe it didn&#39;t happen. But
maybe it did. And it&#39;s when he&#39;s first President. This is a great example of
how everyone perceived him to be this imposing, scary character. </p>
<p>There is some kind of
a reception really early on when the government first gets under way, and
Washington&#39;s there and Alexander Hamilton is there, and one of Hamilton&#39;s
friends named Gouverneur Morris is there. And Morris and Hamilton always get
each other into trouble because they have the same sense of humor and they&#39;re
kind of practical jokers and it&#39;s just a bad thing; if the two of them are
together bad things happen. So this is a great occasion of that in which
Hamilton says to Morris, &#39;I&#39;ll bet you a dinner you don&#39;t dare go up to
Washington and slap him on the back and say, &#39;Damn good to see you, Sir.&#39; [laughs]
[laughter] It was like: you don&#39;t dare touch him. Right? &#39;You go touch him.
I&#39;ll bet you a dinner you don&#39;t dare.&#39; Right? Ridiculous, but Morris apparently
takes up the bet, goes up to Washington, pats him on the back, &#39;damn good to
see you, General,&#39; and later reports the look that he got from Washington at
imposing in this way. He said he just wanted the floor to open up so he could
just go through, like &quot;poof,&quot; I&#39;m gone, [laughter] and he supposedly
went back to Hamilton and said, &quot;Yeah, I won the bet, not worth it&quot; [laughter]--really
not worth it. He is just this imposing figure. </p>
<p>During the war, on
many occasions he actually really had to be an imposing figure not just for
reasons of concrete military success, which--it&#39;s true he did, for that reason--but
also because he individually personified the Revolutionary cause in many ways,
including to the British, not just to his own men but to the British as well,
to British military authorities. He had to be imposing enough to command
respect from people who were not necessarily prepared to see him as the
commanding general of a real army. And as an example of this, one of the sort
of war games that the British occasionally deployed against Washington was to
address things to him in writing by a civilian title, to George Washington,
Esquire, rather than General George Washington, right?--doing that really
deliberately. &#39;Yeah, okay, we&#39;re going to be respectful, George Washington,
Esquire, but you&#39;re not really a general and it&#39;s not a real army&#39;--is the
implication. </p>
<p>So on one occasion,
British General Howe addresses a letter to Washington: George Washington,
Esquire. Washington sees this, gets the letter, refuses to accept it and sends
it back: &#39;it&#39;s not addressed to me.&#39; Okay. So then Howe readdresses it and this
time he says to: George Washington, Esquire, etcetera, etcetera. Yeah. [laughter]
This gets sent along with an aide back to Washington and Washington--the aide
assures Washington that, quote, &quot;The etcetera, etcetera, implied
everything that ought to follow.&quot; Right? He may not have said General
Washington but the etcetera means he was thinking it [laughs] so that&#39;s pretty
feeble. Washington says, &quot;It&#39;s true that etcetera, etcetera implied
everything and they also implied anything&quot; and he refuses to accept it
again: &#39;this is not addressed to me.&#39; And he sends it back, which takes some
fortitude to be sort of standing there handing back this piece of paper
multiple times to this person--this aide to General Howe. </p>
<p>Supposedly, someone
who was there said that the aide had, quote, &quot;a pleasing confusion on him
the whole time.&quot; Right? He just didn&#39;t know what to do, because he just
didn&#39;t expect to confront this figure who would just stand there and say, &#39;No.
You don&#39;t respect me. I don&#39;t accept it. Now what are you going to do?&#39; So it
completely put him on the defensive, this poor British aide, and he had to sort
of go back and sort of figure out what to do so that they could address him in
some way that he would actually read the letter. He had to be someone who could
maintain his dignity and maintain his position, not just to command an army,
but also to command the respect of the enemy. </p>
<p>So clearly he&#39;s an
imposing figure and he had to be, but there&#39;s an important point to make here,
and that is, Washington combined that imposing demeanor with something that was
equally if not more important for him to display as a leader in the new nation,
and as particularly a military leader in the new nation, and that is that he
had a modest demeanor. He was imposing, but he did not look like someone who
was grasping for power. He knew how to display himself to his best advantage,
but he wasn&#39;t all pomp and show and display. He was the opposite. He was
modest, he was cool, he was reserved, and this was really important in the new
American nation for some very good reasons which had to do with distrust of
power. </p>
<p>In many ways, as
we&#39;ve seen in this course so far, the events leading up to the Revolution had
confirmed Americans&#39; worst fears about tyranny and power. To Americans, first Parliament
and then the King had become tyrannical and had used their power to destroy the
liberties of American colonists. So now, enter George Washington who is given
command of the American army and, as you&#39;ve already seen and discussed in the
course, one of the most obvious and deadly tools of tyranny is a standing army.
And history has plenty examples of what happens when the wrong man gets control
of an army, and of course the most famous example would be Julius Caesar. And
in Caesar you have this brilliant warrior whose army was loyal to him and not
to the Roman state, and eventually Caesar took his army, marched on Rome,
seized power, basically destroyed the Roman republic and installed himself as
emperor. That&#39;s not ancient history to Americans or to anyone in the period.
That&#39;s a lesson. That&#39;s a warning. Look at what happens when ambitious men get
military power. You get dictatorship. You get tyranny. You get all of the
things that Americans certainly are afraid might happen--and things are in
flux; they might happen. </p>
<p>So here we have
Washington taking command of an organized--or I suppose you could say
semi-organized--army, a frightening concept and certainly a really tricky
situation for the person taking command of an army in that kind of an atmosphere.
So creating a small &quot;r&#39; republican army is a tricky thing. That kind of an
army--It--Certainly, it has to be disciplined, but it can&#39;t seem like this
polished, professional fighting force because that moves off into the territory
of: wait a minute. Is this detached from the state? What is this? Is this
some private Washington army? It has to seem able to be sort of submissive to
the state and yet able to fight and defend. It has to be a really careful
balance between having power but not having too much power, being able to do
what it&#39;s supposed to do but not being able seemingly to do it without any
other authority of any kind--and this is Washington&#39;s task. </p>
<p>He has to create this
really difficult to define thing, a republican army, and we&#39;ve already seen how
hard it would have been just generally to create an army out of people from all
of these different colonies and then finally all of these different states who
don&#39;t necessarily see eye to eye and they hadn&#39;t worked together before and
they care more about their locality than about anywhere else. So there are all
these basic logistical problems with the army, and now add this one into the
mix, right?--which is an army is something people are very, very nervous about,
and now he&#39;s going to be the guy who&#39;s taking command of it. </p>
<p>Now Washington was
really aware of all of these prevailing fears about power-hungry tyrants and
armies, so he did literally everything that he could do to prove to Americans
inside the Continental Congress and outside of the Continental Congress that he
was not seeking power. Rather, he was accepting power. It was being given to
him but he was not seeking it. And here you can see his good judgment as well
as his skillful self-presentation in play. He&#39;s really sensitive to these
prevailing fears and he&#39;s really skilled at appeasing them. So for example
listen to what he says in his address to the Continental Congress after he&#39;s
nominated as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. Okay. This is his
address. He makes a very brief address, a statement, to the Congress: </p>
<p>&quot;Tho&#39; I am truly
sensible of the high Honour done me, in this Appointment, yet I feel great
distress, from a consciousness that my abilities and military experience may
not be equal to the extensive and important Trust. However, as the Congress
desire it, I will enter upon the momentous duty, and exert every power I
possess in the service, and for support of the glorious cause. I beg they will
accept my most cordial thanks for this distinguished testimony of their
approbation. But, lest some unlucky event should happen, unfavourable to my
reputation, I beg it may be remembered, by every Gentleman in the room, that I,
this day, declare with the utmost sincerity, I do not think myself equal to the
Command I am honored with.&quot; </p>
<p>Okay. He&#39;s just been
given the command of the army and he says, &#39;I&#39;m going to do it. I&#39;m going to
try my hardest. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m up to the task. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m good enough
for this but I&#39;m going to try my hardest.&#39; </p>
<p>Now, given that I&#39;ve
already described how he showed up to the Congress in a military uniform
basically saying, &#39;Hi. I want this position,&#39; certainly he&#39;s not--he was not
someone who was going to look away. He wanted this position of being Commander-in-Chief
of the Army. And he then stands up and announces, &#39;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m good
enough for this,&#39; which might lead you to assume that it&#39;s an empty platitude,
but it really isn&#39;t. It&#39;s the absolute perfect thing for someone in that
position to say at that moment because it reassured people; this is very
explicitly what he was doing. He&#39;s not an ambitious tyrant in the making. And
it did contain some truth, because the fact of the matter is he wanted the
position and he was honestly fearful. You heard him say that if some bad thing
happens to my reputation--his reputation--He does truly fear that maybe he
isn&#39;t up to the task. This seems pretty enormous and who knows what&#39;s going to
happen? So he&#39;s also expressing a sincere concern, a sincere fear. </p>
<p>In that same
statement to Congress, he goes on to do brilliant thing number two--again
another example of his good judgment. He announces that he will serve without
pay as proof that he does not want to make any kind of profit from his service,
that he wants no financial benefit for what he&#39;s doing for his country. Again,
really brilliant thing to do. Now of course he also says he&#39;s going to keep an
exact account of his expenses. Right? He doesn&#39;t want to get a salary, but he
will charge Congress for his expenses--and there is an amusing book titled <i>George
Washington&#39;s Expense Account </i>by Marvin Kitman that looks at what Washington
was actually charging the Congress for. So it&#39;s not as though he was spending a
lot out of pocket. He did keep a careful account of all of his expenses as Commander-in-Chief,
but again that&#39;s a pretty significant statement to make. People noticed it at
the time and commented on it and saw it, the symbolism in it and the meaning of
it, and commented just in the way that he would have hoped people would have
done. He really wanted to make a certain impact, and he did. </p>
<p>So for example, here
is John Adams at the time--not afterwards with his ten talents, but at the
time. He says, </p>
<p>&quot;There is
something charming to me in the conduct of Washington. A gentleman of one of
the first fortunes upon the continent, leaving his delicious retirement, his
family and friends, sacrificing his ease, and hazarding all in the cause of his
country! His views are noble and disinterested. He declared, when he accepted
the mighty trust, that he would lay before us an exact account of his expenses,
and not accept a shilling for pay.&quot; </p>
<p>Or, as another Congressman
put it, &quot;Let our Youth look up to this man as a pattern to form themselves
by; who unites the bravery of the soldier with the most consummate modesty and
virtue.&quot; Okay. That&#39;s exactly the point that he&#39;s trying to make, right?--that
I&#39;m going to take this large command, that I&#39;m not looking personally to profit
by it, and there we have witnesses that are exactly getting that message. </p>
<p>Shortly thereafter he
made yet another symbolic gesture, another example of the way in which he&#39;s so
good at appeasing people&#39;s fears. He gets a letter from the New York Provincial
Congress with a little nervous passage in it reminding him that when the war
ends he&#39;s expected to resign his position and return to civilian life. Okay.
This is a little nervous letter from New York saying, &#39;Please don&#39;t be a
military dictator after the war. Sincerely, the New York Provincial Congress.&#39;
I don&#39;t know what they thought they would accomplish with that letter, but it&#39;s
a valid fear. It&#39;s one that many people had--and again, Washington responds
with a sort of model reply. He says, &quot;When we assumed the Soldier, we did
not lay aside the Citizen; and we shall most sincerely rejoice with you in that
happy hour when the establishment of American Liberty ... shall enable us to
return to our Private Stations in the bosom of a free, peaceful, and happy Country.&quot;
This is exactly what people would have wanted a military leader to say: &#39;I look
forward to the end of the war where I and everyone else can all go home, end of
army, end of power.&#39; And that letter and the New York letter that called it
forth are both published in newspapers around the colonies. </p>
<p>In both of these actions,
Washington is styling himself after the sort of republican ideal of a leader,
right? Someone who&#39;s public minded; he&#39;s self-sacrificing; he&#39;s virtuous; he&#39;s
devoted to his country. There is a play at the time by British writer Joseph
Addison titled <i>Cato, </i>which is based on the life of Cato the Younger who
defended Rome and Roman virtues against the tyrant Caesar, and that was highly
popular in America at this time and not surprisingly, it&#39;s Washington&#39;s
favorite play. Washington has it performed for the troops. It&#39;s reprinted again
and again and again in revolutionary America. And Nathan Hale&#39;s famous last
words, &quot;I regret that I have but one life to lose for my country,&quot;
are adapted from that play. That&#39;s the sort of ideal that Washington&#39;s trying to
live up to, and any wise man assuming a position of leadership--and
particularly military leadership--would have done the same thing. Modesty,
self-sacrifice, not lusting for power. The best way to be trusted and beloved
as a leader was to modestly surrender power again and again, and people would
then be sure to come back and offer you more. </p>
<p>Now it&#39;s worth
mentioning at this point that maybe the most famous thing that Washington ever
did is right along these lines. The most famous thing that he did at the time,
is at the close of the war. The war is over. He has won. He has an army at his
command and what does he do? He resigns his commission and goes home, period.
That was literally world-shaking in its impact. It is not what people thought
would happen at the end of the war. You have a victorious general and an army.
People assume, what happens now is that that victorious general takes power.
Washington literally just said, &#39;Thank you very much&#39; and went back to Mount
Vernon, end of story. </p>
<p>It was noticed the
world over. It was--had such an impact. It literally ensured that Washington
would be the one man most trusted with power forever after, because he had
given that supreme example of giving it up. He had said at the moment where
everyone expected him to keep it, &#39;No. I&#39;m giving it right back.&#39; That&#39;s why
he ends up being the one guy who could have been President--because he proved
in--to Americans at the time, in the ultimate way possible, he was not hungry
for power. Supposedly, at the time--When King George heard that this was what
was going to happen--that Washington was just going to resign and go home--supposedly
his response was that if Washington did do that, quote, &quot;he will be the
greatest man in the world.&quot; That&#39;s the King saying: the impact of that
will be enormous, if he&#39;s actually going to do that. The King doesn&#39;t even
really believe he will, but if he actually does that, that&#39;s an incredible act.
He will be the greatest man in the world. </p>
<p>So one historian has
said basically, &quot;George Washington was the virtuoso of resignations.&quot; [laughs]
He perfected the art of getting power by giving it away. In a sense that&#39;s
true. It&#39;s not that he&#39;s being devious. It&#39;s not that he&#39;s sort of pretending
to be modest because he wants power. It&#39;s that he understands people&#39;s fears.
It&#39;s that he&#39;s serving in positions that he wants to serve, but he then also
understands that his job after serving in them is to step away and allow future
responsibility to be given to him again. He maintains a sort of ideal balance
between ambition and modesty--and it&#39;s this ideal and sort of really necessary
balance in America at the time where people were so scared of power, standing
armies, monarchs, tyrants, dictators, all of these things sort of looming. And
Washington ends up in one way or another proving again and again that he isn&#39;t
any of those things. </p>
<p>And it&#39;s for all of
these reasons why, when King George III finally is let go of--right? I&#39;ve
talked in the past about how Americans first are upset with Parliament and then
finally they&#39;re upset with the King and it&#39;s a slow process of Americans sort
of divorcing themselves from their love and loyalty for England. When they
finally let go of the King, it makes sense, given everything that I&#39;ve just
said, that Washington is the logical person who fills that vacuum of the sort
of symbolic leader who&#39;s going to represent America, who&#39;s going to be the sort
of core symbolic leader of America. </p>
<p>Very early on in the
war, people begin to substitute George Washington for King George in ceremonies
and rituals. As early as 1778, Washington is called the Father of His Country.
Washington&#39;s birthday, and not the King&#39;s, is celebrated as early as 1779. So
literally, he&#39;s just being substituted right in. It&#39;s like, &#39;well, we lost that
symbolic figure. Here&#39;s a new George. We&#39;ll just put him right in. We have a
new leader and he&#39;s virtuous and he&#39;s not ambitious and he&#39;s a good republican
leader so we can actually celebrate him and we want him to be a sort of
symbolic center of the American cause.&#39; </p>
<p>Okay. So I have two
minutes to complete here. What have we seen today? We&#39;ve certainly seen how
Washington looked and acted the part of the ideal republican leader. We&#39;ve seen
how and why this was so important to Americans in revolutionary and early
national America. They had really good reasons to be scared, suspicious about
power and who had it--and Washington proved again and again he was the ideal
person to trust with power. He understood prevailing fears. He addressed
himself to calming those fears in sincere ways in his manner, in his actions,
in his self-presentation, yet also managing to remain an imposing leader
throughout. It was a really difficult balance, I think, for anyone to maintain
and in many ways it&#39;s why he really is the right man with the right skills in
the right place at the right time. </p>
<p>He&#39;s the guy who
manages to maintain that difficult balance--to command an army, to sort of be a
symbolic center of a new nation, to allow for the fact that he&#39;s ambitious but
to not seem too ambitious, to not seem desirous of power. It&#39;s a really, really
tricky thing to carry off and Washington actually did, which is kind of
remarkable. And, granted, there are moments probably when he did it better than
others, but in the end it&#39;s his ability to maintain that kind of balance that
made him the perfect figure for that moment in time and for serving the role
that he served in the Revolution. </p>
<p>Okay. On that I will
conclude. We will move on, on Thursday, to watching Washington in action as we
begin to look at how the war is unfolding on the field of battle. </p>
