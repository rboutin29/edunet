<p><b>Professor Keith Wrightson:
</b>Right.
Well, we&#39;d better get started because there&#39;s quite a lot of ground to cover
today as you will see from the handouts. </p>
<p>Okay. Well, we all
know that Henry VIII had six queens: divorced, beheaded, died, divorced,
beheaded, survived. And that makes good television, and bad television too,
[laughter] and all of those queens are marked on your handouts in
the appropriate place in bold Q1 to Q6, but the real reason that his reign was
so important in English history is of course that he initiated the English
reformation, a momentous change with very far-reaching consequences. And
Henry&#39;s interesting marital career was essentially part of that larger process,
set in train by the will of a powerful king. Well, for that reason the English
reformation was once famously described as being essentially &quot;an act of state,&quot;
its essence being the transfer of legal authority over the church in England
from a distant papacy to a very present English crown. The universal Catholic
Church in England became the Anglican Church of England. So an act of state,
and an act of state it certainly was. It was initiated by the crown and
directed from above and carried through by successive acts of Parliament. And
yet it was also, of course, so much more than that because these acts of state
also inaugurated fundamental changes in the religious culture of the nation.</p>
<p>Looking at the whole,
it&#39;s certainly possible to distinguish, as Christopher Haigh does, a series of
legislative reformations, on the one hand, and to distinguish that from, on the
other hand, what he terms the Protestant reformation, which was a much more
gradual and much more diffuse process of religious change extending over
generations. And yet the two dimensions of the reformation, the legislative
and the Protestant, inevitably went together. </p>
<p>What was once seen as
being a very purposeful process of change--carefully directed, swiftly
accomplished--now tends to be seen as a much more hesitant and uncertain
business, but to call the whole thing, as Christopher Haigh, does &quot;a series of
blundering steps&quot; is perhaps to go a wee bit too far, because there certainly
was purposeful action and the reformation process became much more deliberative
over time as the issues gradually became clearer and as the religious
alignments to which it gave rise gradually crystallized. Christopher Haigh&#39;s
account of it all provides us with an excellent overview, the details of which
take the narrative up to 1603. But what I want to do in the lecture today is to
emphasize the contributions of each phase of development in the crucial
generation from the late 1520s through to 1558--the various stages which
contributed to an emerging religious division--and I want to try to bring out
the logic of those phases of development. All of this can be very confusing in
the details, but there is a certain logic to it. And that means in the first
instance grasping how successive political situations gave rise to particular
developments which had consequences for religious change, one way or the other,
and then later on in section discussion we&#39;ll explore further the larger
question of the extent to which these changes were welcome or unwelcome for the
people at large and the very gradual process of their acceptance. </p>
<p>So let&#39;s look at the
first phase which ran roughly from 1527 to 1531, which we can call a gathering
crisis. Well, if there was a phase of blundering about, as Christopher Haigh
puts it, then it came at the beginning, and it was occasioned of course by the
fact that the King and his advisers were facing a completely unprecedented
situation in 1527. Henry needed a male heir, as you know. The future of the
Tudor dynasty and of the political stability which it had reestablished might
hang on that fact of an undisputed succession. Henry was thirty-six. His
wife, Katherine, was in her early forties. No child was now likely. Now, as
you know, Katherine had originally come to England as the bride of Henry&#39;s
older brother, Arthur, who had shortly died and she had subsequently married
Henry. Brooding on this, Henry by 1527 became preoccupied with a biblical
text, Leviticus 20:21, which translates as &quot;if a man shall take his
brother&#39;s wife it is an unclean thing. He hath uncovered his brother&#39;s
nakedness and they shall be childless.&quot; And at the same time, on a
somewhat less principled note, Henry&#39;s eye had been caught by a young woman of
the court, Anne Boleyn, whom he saw as a potential new queen. She was in her
early twenties, vivacious, ambitious and astute, and she was not willing to be
the king&#39;s mistress; she intended to be queen. </p>
<p>So Henry needed to
get his existing marriage dissolved. He needed it to be declared void from the
beginning by the Pope and to take a new queen, and it should have been very
easy since popes were usually willing to cooperate with the needs of kings in
such matters. But it was rendered difficult by two factors. First of all, Katherine
was a very strong personality. Her sense of honor was outraged by the idea
that her marriage should be dissolved in this way, and in 1527 as matters began
to reach a head her nephew, the Emperor Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire of
Germany, gained control of the Pope, Clement VII, in the course of his Italian
wars. </p>
<p>Now all Henry really
needed was a delegation of authority from Rome to settle the matter and in 1628
[correction: 1528] it looked like he might get it. In that year a papal
ambassador, Cardinal Campeggio, was sent to England and he and Cardinal Thomas
Wolsey were empowered to establish the facts regarding Henry&#39;s marriage, but in
hearings that they inaugurated in 1529 Queen Katherine vigorously defended the
validity of her marriage. She denied that there had been any sexual consummation
to Prince Arthur, Henry&#39;s older brother. She embarrassed the King by publicly
declaring that he knew she had been a virgin when they married. She defended
her honor and her marriage. And then in July 1529 new victories of the Emperor
in Italy meant the Pope was even more firmly under his control and the Pope
revoked the case back to Rome. So the first phase of the developing crisis was
efforts to put pressure on the papacy by threatening the privileges of the
church in England in order to get the Pope to cooperate. </p>
<p>In September 1529,
Cardinal Wolsey, who had clearly failed Henry, was threatened with the legal
charge of <i>praemunire</i>, which was an offense established by statutes in
the fourteenth century regarding the jurisdiction of church and state within
England. He had allegedly illegally exercised his powers as the pope&#39;s legate
in England. And a couple of months later Parliament was called and the members
of Parliament were encouraged by royal counselors to lay complaints not only
against Cardinal Wolsey but also against other alleged abuses in church
affairs. So, at this stage Henry is blustering, he was deliberately stoking up
the latent resentment of clerical privileges amongst members of Parliament, but
as yet there was no intention to go further. Indeed, having set things going in
this manner, fired his warning shots as it were, the King sent Parliament into
recess between December of 1529 and January of 1531, and in the meantime he
assembled a think tank of academics and clergy to prepare his legal case for a
divorce. And he began consulting learned opinion amongst lawyers and
theologians from Europe&#39;s various major universities. But none of this had the
desired effect and in 1530 the Pope cited Henry to appear before him in Rome and
forbade him to remarry until he did so. </p>
<p>The King was both
frustrated and furious, and he found reasons to fail to comply with the Pope&#39;s
requirements in the materials which were being assembled by his academic
research team. These survive and they&#39;re known as the <i>Collecteana</i> and
they included some crucial arguments. One was the argument that historically
the church in England had exercised independent provincial rights. That&#39;s to
say it had the right to autonomy in the settlement of certain internal affairs
without reference to Rome. The second crucial argument, which they put
forward, was that within England the king enjoyed imperial power, not only over
the state but over the church in matters which were not of a strictly spiritual
nature. So Henry, still hoping for a change in the European political
situation which would lead to papal cooperation, used these ideas to put a bit
more pressure on the church. In 1530, his lawyers indicted the entire clergy
in England for <i>praemunire</i>, illegally acquiescing in the exercise of
papal authority. The convocation of the church, meeting in Canterbury,
resisted and Henry demanded that they recognize his supreme headship of the
church. And they eventually did so. They recognized his authority but only &quot;so
far as the law of God allows,&quot; a saving clause, and they gave the King a grant
of 120,000 pounds from the church to try to sweeten his mood. </p>
<p>So where are we in
1531? The King and the church have fallen out badly over Henry&#39;s need for a
dissolution of his marriage. The central issue has been clarified. The
central issue has become that of legal jurisdiction of the papacy over the
English church and therefore its ability to frustrate his divorce since the
church had authority over marriage. But there was no question of any doctrinal
challenge to the Roman Catholic Church, no challenge in matters of faith or
matters of worship. This is a legal issue at this point: which brings us to
phase two, the Royal Supremacy. </p>
<p>As 1531 advanced,
there was no indication that the Pope was going to give way and the political
impasse precipitated the second phase of development, the royal supremacy, and
it was masterminded by Thomas Cromwell between 1532 and 1535. Now a brief word
on Thomas Cromwell. He was a man of very humble origins, the son of a London
cloth worker and tavern keeper. He had had an obscure early career. He&#39;d
probably served as a soldier in Germany, he had worked as a merchant, and
eventually he went into the law. In the 1520s, he gradually emerged as a very
skillful man of business in the household of Cardinal Wolsey, much trusted by
Wolsey for his astuteness and competence. And in 1530 when Wolsey fell such was
Cromwell&#39;s reputation that he was taken into the King&#39;s service and by 1530 was
made a member of the council. And it was Cromwell who saw the way out of the
legal impasse through a carefully planned program of legislation. He knew
exactly what he was doing. Memoranda in his own hand survive which show the
stages of his planning, and in 1532 to &#39;34 his strategy of making Henry&#39;s
divorce possible and then legitimizing these changes was executed stage by
stage through the careful presentation of the King&#39;s desires to Parliament and
management of Parliament to get them passed. </p>
<p>First of all, they put
still more pressure on the church to break any resistance within England. Parliament
was brought to pass the Act in Restraint of Annates. Annates were payments to
Rome which were made when bishops were appointed. This canceled them, but the Act
was held in suspension as a threat to papal finance. Secondly, the House of
Commons put forward what was called its Supplication Against the Ordinaries, a
petition against the exercise of ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the church
courts in England and the abuses which allegedly took place. This was an
attack which provoked the convocation of the church, its own assembly, to
reject the accusations. Henry then rounded angrily on them and demanded their
full submission, and in May 1532 they caved in. The convocation submitted and
abandoned its claim to legal jurisdictional independence. The way was now
clear in England, but there was still no response from Rome and then fate lent
a hand. </p>
<p>In August 1532, the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Archbishop Warham, died. Henry and Cromwell managed
to secure the appointment and the confirmation from Rome of Thomas Cranmer as
the new Archbishop of Canterbury. Now Cranmer was a Cambridge academic who had
taken a great interest in the early development of Protestantism in the 1520s. Henry
and Cromwell knew him as one of the King&#39;s think tank and they knew that he was
willing to do Henry&#39;s bidding over the divorce. With that confidence, an
Archbishop of Canterbury who would do the King&#39;s will, Anne Boleyn at last gave
in to Henry&#39;s importunities. By December 1532 she was known to be pregnant and
in January of 1533 they were secretly married. The King was willing to go
ahead and do that because he was convinced that his first marriage would be
declared to have been void. But now with Anne pregnant things had to move fast.
</p>
<p>In April of 1533,
Parliament was brought to pass the Act in Restraint of Appeals, a crucial
statute. This declared that England was an imperial monarchy, no foreign
jurisdiction was valid within its boundaries, no appeals against a judicial
decision made in England could be taken outside the kingdom. And accordingly in
May of 1533 Cranmer assembled a court, annulled Henry&#39;s marriage to Katherine
of Aragon. And in June 1533, Anne, already secretly married to the King, was
crowned as queen, already six months pregnant with the future Queen Elizabeth I
who was born on the seventh of September. And in the same month, September
1533, the Pope responded by excommunicating the King, casting him out of the
church, but he held the excommunication in suspension in case Henry would begin
to behave. </p>
<p>But Henry didn&#39;t
behave. That wasn&#39;t his way. [Laughter] In 1534, Parliament
passed the Succession Act declaring the validity of the annulment of Henry&#39;s
marriage and his remarriage and fixing the succession to the crown in the new
line. Oaths were required from all major office holders to respect the Act of
Succession. An Act for Submission of the Clergy was passed to legally enshrine
the clergy&#39;s submission and finally the Act of Supremacy, which declared Henry VIII
to be the Supreme Head of the Church of England. In sum then, the necessity of
securing the Tudor dynasty had led to England entering into a state of schism.
Schism. They had rejected the jurisdictional authority of Rome, they had
asserted the royal supremacy over the church, and in 1534 to &#39;5 this was backed
up with a flurry of executions of individuals who dared to defend the Aragon
marriage and the authority of the pope, and those who were executed included
John Fisher, the reforming Bishop of Rochester who could not tolerate this, and
most famously Thomas More, the former Lord Chancellor, former good servant of
the King, who also could not stomach this and died for it. </p>
<p>So we now enter a
third phase, the Henrician Reformation. Now on the face of it, the royal
supremacy over the church had nothing whatever to do with religious
reformation. It was a rejection for reasons of state of the supposedly usurped
legal jurisdictional powers of the Bishop of Rome, but it had nothing to do
with Protestantism and it was not intended to inaugurate reform in matters of
faith or worship. But of course it did. It took place in a context of the
reformation in Europe. It aligned England against Rome, if not necessarily with
the Protestant princes of Germany, or the Protestant cantons of Switzerland. It
gave an initial foothold to that minority who favored some measure of religious
reform, and there were already people around the King who were prepared to use
that opportunity purposefully, though necessarily with extreme caution. Thomas
Cromwell certainly favored reform. Queen Anne favored reform. She received
Protestant books which were secretly brought to her by London merchants and
read them with interest. Thomas Cranmer favored reform, as he had done for
some years. </p>
<p>On the other hand,
most of the bishops and most of the nobility were willing to go only so far
with Henry. They would accept the royal supremacy for the good of the kingdom,
for the good of the succession, but they hoped that it would all end ultimately
in a reconciliation with Rome. So they would go along for the time being. The
key figure in all of this of course was Henry then himself, and once he had the
royal supremacy Henry found that he rather liked it. [Laughter]
He was happy to adopt the position of a moderate reformer of abuses and over
time he increasingly came to believe in his own propaganda. He saw himself as
a Solomon, as a Josiah who had promulgated God&#39;s law and purged the land of
abuses and idolatry. And at the same time the King was notoriously susceptible
to influence and if those who held his trust were able to steer things in the
direction that they favored, then the King might back them if they were
cautious, though they were always well advised to proceed with extreme caution
in order to retain the King&#39;s confidence. He was willing to be influenced but
he could react fiercely if he thought he was being abused. </p>
<p>Well, in the mid to
late 1530s Thomas Cromwell and Thomas Cranmer certainly had the King&#39;s trust. They
had served him very well as Archbishop of Canterbury in Cranmer&#39;s case or in
Cromwell&#39;s case as Vicegerent in Spirituals, the office of administering the
church on behalf of the King. And they did a great deal to mold developments. In
1536, they issued ten articles of faith and a set of injunctions for the
practice of worship in the church which moved very, very cautiously in a
reformist direction. In 1536, Thomas Cromwell organized a visitation, an
inspection, of the monasteries which was deliberately intended to find abuses
and which led, later in 1536, to the dissolution of all religious houses worth
less than 200 pounds a year, the smaller monasteries. It was not presented as
an attack on monasticism in principle but as an attack upon abuses. </p>
<p>It was a severe shock
and it was one of the issues which provoked in 1536 rebellion in the north of
England. That rebellion, which we&#39;ll deal with on another occasion, was
suppressed in 1537 and in the aftermath of that suppression the larger
monasteries were gradually cajoled and encouraged and bullied into surrendering
freely their possessions to the crown. By 1540, every monastery and nunnery in
the kingdom had gone. In 1537, Cromwell and Cranmer engineered the issue of
the Bishop&#39;s Book, a set of homilies which again moved cautiously towards
Protestant definitions of faith. In 1538, the great shrines, the great centers
of pilgrimage at Canterbury and Durham and elsewhere were dissolved, their
riches seized by the crown, broken up on the grounds that they had been
idolatrously abused. And in 1538 the Bible was issued in English; the Great
Bible, a translation into English which was actually based upon the
translations of the Bible by William Tyndale and Miles Coverdale, both of whom
were Protestants. That was not officially admitted but it was a fact. These
were the only translations ready to hand and they needed to produce the Bible
quickly. The Great Bible, then, was issued and on the frontispiece, the
magnificent frontispiece of the Bible, shows Henry sitting in majesty handing
down the word of God to his grateful people. There was not much doubt that by
1539 things had gone a lot farther than anyone anticipated and that elements of
reformed doctrine were being gradually smuggled into Henry&#39;s church. But in
that year the King called a halt. </p>
<p>The situation had
changed again. Another of the events of 1536, to go back a few years, was the
fall of Anne Boleyn. After her marriage to the King and the promising start of
the birth of Princess Elizabeth, no male heir had been born. Anne had suffered
a series of miscarriages. She was in a state of acute nervous anxiety,
understandably. Eventually, she was suspected. Word was brought to the kKng
planting suspicions that she had committed adultery in her desperation to have
a child. Other accusations were brought against her. The Queen was arrested
and executed, and shortly thereafter Henry married Jane Seymour, another lady
of the court. The death shortly after that of Queen Katherine meant that the
marriage to Jane Seymour was now of undoubted legitimacy--both of Henry&#39;s
earlier queens were dead--and in 1537 she gave birth, at last, to a male heir,
Prince Edward. Jane herself died in childbed. </p>
<p>So the King had his
son. That could have cleared the way for reconciliation with Rome and his more
conservative counselors hoped that it would do so quickly, but here again
Henry&#39;s personality proved vital. By now Henry sincerely believed in his role
as Supreme Head of the Church of England. The question at issue was how he
would exercise his power. His conservative counselors persuaded him of the
dangers of the growth of radical Protestantism in the country. They pointed
out that Anabaptists had been discovered in London, that there were so-called
&#39;Sacramentarians&#39; at large. These were people who followed the Swiss
reformation&#39;s teaching on the nature of Holy Communion. In 1539, Henry was
persuaded to endorse the Act of Six Articles which returned England to
unambiguous Catholic doctrinal orthodoxy in matters of faith. And in 1540
Thomas Cromwell, having been accused by his enemies of secretly encouraging
heresy, was arrested and swiftly executed. His real crime was in fact the
fiasco of having arranged the King&#39;s fourth marriage, his marriage to the
German princess Anne of Cleves, which brought Henry into alignment with the
Lutheran princes of Germany. Henry, deceived by a flattering portrait, was
horrified when Anne of Cleves arrived. He described her as a &quot;Flemish mare.&quot; He
refused to consummate the marriage and it was swiftly dissolved. This was a
lucky break for Anne of Cleves who retired to estates in eastern England where
she happily lived out the rest of her life, so she came out of this quite well
[laughter] all things considered. Thomas Cromwell lost his head.
</p>
<p>Now this phase of
events is often portrayed as a return to full Catholic orthodoxy accompanied by
a reinvigoration of traditional worship in the parishes. But I think again that
goes too far. What was ruling in the late years of Henry was not full Catholic
orthodoxy. It was really Henry&#39;s own peculiarly idiosyncratic conscience and
desires in matters of religion. Henry would certainly burn the occasional
radical Protestant if one was caught, but he also executed the occasional
Catholic for opposing the royal supremacy. On one occasion he made a
demonstration by having several of each executed on the same day. You can say
what you like about Henry, not a nice man, a persecutor, but he was an equal
opportunity persecutor. [Laughter] </p>
<p>Henry was listening
to some of the conservative voices in the council, especially Bishop Gardiner
of Winchester and the conservative faction which circulated around Thomas
Howard, the Earl [correction: Duke] of Norfolk. He came under their influence
quite heavily in 1540 when Norfolk brought to his attention his young niece, Katherine
Howard, who became Henry&#39;s new bride, his fifth wife, pushed into his bed at
the age of eighteen by her uncle in the hope of assuring greater influence for
his faction. Nevertheless, although Henry was increasingly under the influence
of conservative figures, he never lost his trust in Thomas Cranmer and indeed
he shielded Cranmer from enemies who would have loved to bring about his fall.
And after the discovery of Katherine Howard&#39;s actual adultery in 1542 and her
execution, the King was much less influenced by his more conservative advisers.
</p>
<p>Certainly, the
gradual drift of the 1530s in the direction of some kind of neo-Lutheran reform
of doctrine had halted, but England&#39;s religion under Henry in his later years
was not full orthodoxy. Parish religion was not as it had been. The cult of
the saints and the shrines and the relics had been greatly reduced. The cult of
purgatory was gone. The monasteries were gone. And on the more positive side a
new vernacular religious culture using the English Bible and English service
books had come into being. And if really, truly doctrinally Protestant people
were still very much a minority they were a growing minority and to some extent
a powerful minority. They included some very powerful people whose potential
influence was out of all proportion to their numbers. Cranmer was still the archbishop
and he favored and helped reformers in the universities and in the church. In
1543, Henry&#39;s last queen, Queen Catherine Parr, who was as much his nurse as
his queen, came into a position of authority and she again showed great
sympathy towards reform. The so-called Seymour Circle at court, those gathered
around Edward and Thomas Seymour, the brothers of Henry&#39;s dead queen, Jane
Seymour, and the uncles of young Prince Edward, also favored Protestantism--and
above all, perhaps, in their direct influence, the tutors who were appointed to
the young Prince Edward and to his sister, Princess Elizabeth, appointed by
Archbishop Cranmer, were all closet Protestants. So all of this was the legacy
of the Henrician reformation. It had not been a truly Protestant reformation
but I think it marked a far more significant break with tradition than is
sometimes recognized. </p>
<p>Okay. Let&#39;s move on
now to a fourth phase, the Edwardian reformation. Henry VIII at last died in
January 1547, aged only fifty-six though he&#39;d been in a state of some
decrepitude for years. And the new king, King Edward, was only nine and a half
years old and that of course is another of those contingencies that helped to
shape the history of the reformation. Edward&#39;s uncle, Edward Seymour, led a
group of reform-minded men in taking control at the center of power. Seymour
was appointed protector of the young prince and Duke of Somerset. Now as Duke
of Somerset and protector, Seymour and his friends&#39; prime interest was
advancing their own power and influence, but there&#39;s little doubt that he was also
of sincere Protestant views and in that context Archbishop Cranmer was able to
exercise far more influence than he had since 1539. </p>
<p>The changes in
religion which were brought about in the next two and a half years suggest a
very high degree of commitment of these men at the center. They may not have
known in 1547 just how far they were going to go, but they certainly intended
to go further than Henry VIII had and they acted swiftly once they had the
power. In 1547, Parliament was persuaded to repeal the heresy laws and the Six
Articles; no more burning of Protestants. They issued reformist injunctions
for the removal of images and the obliteration of religious paintings by
whitewashing them in the churches. That&#39;s when those paintings I described to
you in Saint Agatha&#39;s Easby were whitewashed, only to be discovered again 400
years later. A book of homilies was issued, official sermons of broadly
Lutheran sympathy in their doctrine. Religious guilds and confraternities were
suppressed and their goods were confiscated by the crown. In 1548, communion
was allowed in &#39;both kinds&#39;; that is, both bread and wine were administered to
the laity in the Protestant style. And in 1549 Cranmer issued a prayer book,
and an act of uniformity to insist upon its use, which was at least half
Protestant in doctrine. </p>
<p>That prayer book
brought brief rebellion in the west of England, the so-called Prayer Book
Rebellion, which centered in the counties of the southwest and led briefly to
the siege of Exeter before a royal army arrived to disperse the rebels and to
follow their dispersal with the savage repression of this resistance. Something
like 4,000 rebels were either killed or executed immediately after the
rebellion. As a result, though, Somerset&#39;s dominance in the council was shaken
and he was replaced as a central figure by John Dudley, the Duke of
Northumberland. That change at the center, however, did not lead to any change
in religious policy. In fact, Dudley backed additional innovations in order to
keep the support of Archbishop Cranmer and indeed the favor of the young King
himself. Edward by this time had emerged as a youth of pronouncedly
evangelical Protestant beliefs and inclinations, verging indeed on bigotry. He
was often described as the &#39;young Josiah&#39;, a biblical figure, the young king
who would bring true reform and cleansing of the church. In particular, in
1552 a further prayer book was issued, a revised prayer book, this one
decisively and openly Protestant, and it was backed in 1553 by an emphatically
Protestant statement of faith, the Forty-two Articles. </p>
<p>So, okay, let&#39;s take
stock. The Church of England under Henry VIII was a peculiarly personal blend
of doctrinal orthodoxy with elements of reform in worship and practice. But a
true Protestant minority had emerged especially in London and the southeast and
among certain powerful members of the social elite, and under the boy king
Edward VI and his two regents true Protestant reform moved ahead rapidly over
six years. By 1553, the Church of England was clearly Protestant in doctrine
and in forms of worship, centered on the English Bible and on the Prayer Book
and the nation had become deeply divided in matters of faith. And that leads us
to the fifth phase of this process, the Marian Reaction. </p>
<p>Edward VI, the boy
king, died of pulmonary tuberculosis only a month after the issue of the
Protestant Forty-two Articles of Religion and the wheel turned again. Desperate
to avoid loss of power, the Duke of Northumberland proclaimed as queen Lady Jane
Grey, the nearest Protestant successor who could be named except Princess
Elizabeth, who was left out because she was still stigmatized as illegitimate. Henry
VIII&#39;s daughter, Mary, who at this time was living in seclusion in East Anglia,
was not willing to accept this. As the daughter of King Henry and of Katherine
of Aragon, she raised support amongst the gentry of East Anglia, formed an army
and began to move towards London. The Duke of Northumberland lost his nerve. He
disbanded his troops, capitulated and gave himself up. </p>
<p>So after the turmoil
of the previous twenty-five years Mary had become queen after all. The thing
Henry had sought so hard to avoid had happened. Now how far Mary&#39;s success in
being able to raise troops and finding widespread support for her accession to
the crown, how far it was a result of the fact of her Tudor blood and that she
clearly was the direct heir, or how far it depended upon the appeal of the fact
that she was known to be deeply loyal to the old religion, that&#39;s an open
question. But a deeply loyal Catholic she certainly was. Her young life had
been blighted by the dissolution of her mother&#39;s marriage and the King&#39;s
subsequent actions. She clung, as part of her very identity you could say, to
the old religion and her subsequent policies bear the stamp of that. And they
also reveal just how divided the nation had become by this stage. </p>
<p>Late in 1553, soon
after her accession, Parliament was persuaded to repeal Edward&#39;s Act of
Uniformity which had enforced uniform Protestant worship in the nation. Interestingly
though, eighty members of Parliament were brave enough to oppose that action. Early
in 1554, Mary married. She married Prince Philip of Spain, the future King
Philip II, and that marriage was accepted by Parliament, though with great
reluctance and only after the suppression of a brief flurry of rebellion in
Kent where Sir Thomas Wyatt led a small army to try to seize London and prevent
the Spanish marriage. The citizens of London shut the gates against him and he
was defeated and executed. Then, in the fall of 1554, full papal jurisdiction
was restored in England. Cardinal Reginald Pole, the great English churchman
who had been living in exile in Italy, arrived to absolve the realm from its
schism and was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, but interestingly he was
only--the absolution of England from schism--was only accepted after the Pope
had agreed that monastery land would remain with those who had been granted it
or who had purchased it under Henry VIII. That would not be restored to the
church. </p>
<p>England then was part
of the Catholic fold again, though on terms. Many Protestant ministers in the
church were deprived of their livings and many of them went into exile abroad. The
universities of Oxford and Cambridge were also purged. Some [correction:
eighty] members of Cambridge colleges and some [correction:sixty] members of
Oxford colleges went into exile abroad. Something like 800 ministers or laymen
and their families of pronouncedly Protestant belief also went into exile. From
December 1554, those who remained in England faced the penalties of a revival
of the Heresy Act, punishing heresy with death, and the burnings began. Between
1555 and 1558, over 300 people were burned at the stake. Some of them were
amongst the most notable figures of the Henrician and Edwardian church. Bishops
Latimer and Ridley, two leading Protestants, were burned at Oxford in 1555. Latimer--they
were burned facing each other in the marketplace at Oxford--Latimer famously
calling out to Ridley as the flames came up, &quot;be brave, Master Ridley. Play
the man.&quot; </p>
<p>Archbishop Cranmer
was also burned at Oxford in 1556. He had temporally recanted his
Protestantism from his fear of death but then went back on his recantation, declared
openly his commitment to the new religion and was burned in 1556, holding out
into the flames the hand with which he had signed his recantation. &quot;This
hand hath offended,&quot; he said. Most of the people who were burned,
however, were not the great leaders of the church but humble people, most of
them from London and the southeast. In fact, almost half the burnings took
place in London, in the city of Colchester and in Canterbury. The southeast
was the focus of Protestant strength. They were usually laypeople. Only a
tenth of them were clergymen. They were often young. Most of them were under thirty
and a very high proportion of those executed were around twenty years old. These
were people who had never really known the old religion and who had grown up in
the new and proved prepared to die for it. </p>
<p>Well, the effects of
this holocaust of Protestant resistance are debatable. Certainly Mary, her
bishops and her advisers had simply never expected the resistance to be so
widespread or so prolonged. But the fact that Mary persisted in her policy to
the end really does her no honor. If she had no reason to love her father&#39;s
memory, it&#39;s clear at least that she shared his implacability with those who
opposed her, and by doing so the persecution helped to cement England&#39;s
religious divisions and associated the old religion with a level of persecution
that was wholly unprecedented. There had never been religious persecution of
this intensity, and indeed it was intense not only by English standards but by
the standards of continental Europe at the time. </p>
<p>Well, what might have
happened given more time we&#39;ll never know, because Mary died in November 1558
aged only forty-two. Christopher Haigh suggests, as have a number of other
recent historians, that her reign appears to be an aberration only in
hindsight. He thinks she might have succeeded had she been given time. Protestant
resistance would have lessened, the old religion would have become
reestablished fully and normalized, and perhaps that may well be the case. But
there&#39;s also a sense in which one could say her reign was regarded by at least
some as a temporary interlude even before her death. Mary was thirty-seven
when she came to the throne, thirty-eight when she married a Spanish prince who
was usually absent from her, abroad seeing to the affairs of his other
possessions. She was childless despite a couple of phantom pregnancies which
gave her hope. She had little prospect of bearing an heir, despite her
desperate hopes both for herself and for her faith. For Mary all this was
undoubtedly a personal tragedy and it&#39;s been suggested that she died in a state
of profound depression in her last months. </p>
<p>Both those who
supported her and those who opposed her knew that in the background was another
claimant to the throne, Princess Elizabeth, and that her accession to the
throne would almost certainly bring about another alteration in religion. To
some degree it could be anticipated well in advance. What they didn&#39;t know,
though, was that this time, after the twists and turns of the generation
between 1527 and 1558, it would last. And it would last partly because of the
nature of the religious settlement which Elizabeth introduced, partly because
of the way in which she was able to defend it, and partly for another very
simple contingent reason. When Elizabeth was proclaimed queen on the death of
her sister on November the 17th, 1558, she was only twenty-five years old and
she lived to be seventy--and more of that next week. </p>
