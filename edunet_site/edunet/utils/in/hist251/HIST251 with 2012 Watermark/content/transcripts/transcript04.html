<p><b>Professor Keith Wrightson:
</b>Okay.
Well, last time looking at the household provided a point of entry to some of
the basic realities and priorities that shape people&#39;s lives at the most basic
level in the sixteenth century. But as is already apparent, I hope, these
households of course didn&#39;t live in isolation. On the contrary, every family
was conducting its affairs in the context of a larger landscape of social
institutions and relationships, and what I want to do this week, in concluding
the sort of contextual introduction, is to talk about some of these connections
that bound people together and bound the country together. And I&#39;ll start by
looking at some of the more localized institutions and relationships, those
which bound them together into local communities. </p>
<p>But as soon as I use
that word, &quot;community,&quot; I have to pause because it&#39;s a very loaded
term. Its use tends to beg an important question about society in the period. Put
simply, people in sixteenth-century England didn&#39;t live in entities called
communities. They lived in places they described as manors or parishes,
villages or townships. They very rarely used the term &quot;community&quot; at
all. When we talk about communities, as we often do, we&#39;re actually
introducing a concept which is largely a construct of sociologists and
historians, and more than that we&#39;re also implying something about the nature
and the quality of the social relationships that existed in the manors and
parishes and villages and townships of the distant past. </p>
<p>The very word
&quot;community&quot; carries a great deal of warmth. It&#39;s a good word to co-opt
in the cause of any argument as we see constantly in political life. It
vibrates with a certain moral resonance, and when that term gets adopted by
historians and sociologists it often also invokes a certain nostalgia about the
past. Community always seems to be just out of reach, something that belongs
to a generation or two ago; just over the hill; in decline or under threat.
It&#39;s sort of the before of which we are the after; tantalizing, warm, the
attractive feature of a world we have lost. And that shouldn&#39;t surprise us. The
very term &quot;community&quot; has very old roots derived from the Latin and
meaning literally the quality of being at one. But the concept as it was
developed by nineteenth- and twentieth-century sociologists was often used by
them as a point of reference from which to examine, and often to judge, the
rapid social changes taking place at that time. </p>
<p>So the traditional or
the folk community was very commonly envisaged by the founders of the social
sciences as being almost everything that modern European and American society
was ceasing to be. It&#39;s rural. It&#39;s small scale. It&#39;s economically simple. It&#39;s
introverted and deeply rooted and warm and personal and homogeneous in values
and stable--embodying indeed, one could say, some of the traditions of pastoral
literature. I don&#39;t know if you know Thomas Gray&#39;s eighteenth-century poem the
&quot;Elegy in a Country Churchyard,&quot; but it&#39;s a good example of that kind of
literature. Gray envisaged what he called the &quot;rude Forefathers of the hamlet&quot;
buried in the churchyard. He described them as having bent themselves to &quot;useful
toil&quot; and &quot;homely joys&quot;, &quot;far from the madding crowd,&quot; living in a &quot;cool,
sequester&#39;d vale of life.&quot; These are all phrases from the poem, many of which have
become widely used. </p>
<p>Okay. Well, it&#39;s
easy to appreciate why historians exposed to that long tradition of thinking
about small communities in the past are sometimes apt to imagine the past and
to assume certain things about the quality of life in the past in those morally
loaded terms. To one historian, for example, the late fifteenth- and early
sixteenth-century village was like--he describes it as--&quot;a family embracing and
composed of many families.&quot; Another describes how, to quote him, &quot;the
unchanging traditional life of the peasant system flowed on uninterrupted like
a deep underground river.&quot; It had flowed thus for a thousand years and it
&quot;would continue to flow for another two hundred.&quot; Now in contrast you get some
historians who react violently against what they see as a sentimentalization of
these rural communities. One in particular has described a Tudor village as
being, to quote him, &quot;a place filled with malice and hatred, its only
unifying bond being the occasional episode of mass hysteria which temporarily
bound together the majority in order to harry and persecute the local witch.&quot;<sup>1</sup>
So that&#39;s how he sees it, but both of these positions derive from a concept,
the concept of community, which is so emotionally powerful that it tends to
seduce some scholars into a kind of sentimentality and on the other hand it
enrages others into an equally distorted cynicism about human relations.</p>
<p>Some have suggested
that it might be better if we just stopped talking about communities
altogether, but to do that would surely be to throw out the baby with the bath
water, because the concept of community is very hard to do without. It does
describe a certain aspect of social relationships in local society which is not
just a nostalgic myth; a certain intensity of connectedness amongst people
focused on their local institutions; certain qualities of recognition of one
another, of reciprocity in relationships with one another, of mutuality, of
identification, of obligation. As historians, we mustn&#39;t assume uncritically
that particular settlements or localities in the past were communities in the
classical sense with all the positive characteristics traditionally believed to
go along with them. Community isn&#39;t a thing or a place. It&#39;s a quality of
living. It varies. It&#39;s not always present. It waxes and wanes over time. It&#39;s
subject to change. It exists in different forms and it doesn&#39;t simply, of
course, belong to the past. It&#39;s a perennial aspect of the human situation,
but if you want to consider it in the past then we can best do so by trying to
carefully reconstruct the actual ties, institutional and personal, that linked
people together, the ties through which they mapped out their social world, so
to speak; the ties through which they made it legible and understandable. Well,
such relationships and the institutions that embodied them could be thought of
as the connective tissue of society at the most basic level and they were of
many kinds. </p>
<p>Some were
relationships of authority. We&#39;ve already encountered these in a social order
imagined in terms of hierarchical ties of obligation and differentiation. In
rural society, more broadly, the basic defining relationship was a relationship
of authority, the relationship of lordship and tenancy. You can imagine
sixteenth-century England as being like a myriad of small settlements, most of
them of less than 500 people, scattered over a landscape of considerable
diversity. In the early sixteenth century that landscape hadn&#39;t even been
mapped. The first county maps, which county by county attempted to survey and
map England, were actually produced by Christopher Saxton in 1576. It was such
an important publication that as the maps were pulled from the press some of
them were taken still wet to Elizabeth I&#39;s chief minister Lord Burghley. He
saw the political potential of having accurate maps of the country for the
first time. But in the early sixteenth century they didn&#39;t yet exist. Nonetheless,
the landscape was mapped and structured in another sense by the realities of
lordship, the possession of the land and the authority over tenants that went
with it. </p>
<p>So, late medieval,
early sixteenth-century, social organization was inscribed on the land through
lordship and the characteristic unit of lordship was what they called the
&#39;manor&#39;, a unit of land under the authority of a lord. Some lords held only a
single manor, the petty gentlemen of the countryside. Some of them held many. One
for example, Lord Berkeley, which is spelled Berkeley as in our college, pronounced
&quot;Barkley&quot; in England, Lord Berkeley owned so much of the county of Gloucestershire
down here that he was described by one contemporary as being &quot;embowelled into
the soil of that country.&quot; But whatever the case, whether their land holdings
were small or great, the fact of lordship over manors was fundamental to the
structure of local society. The people who cultivated the land usually did so
as tenants of such manorial lords, and the forms in terms of their tenancies
determined their relationship to their lords and in many respects their
relationships to one another. </p>
<p>Now these forms of
tenancy were many and varied but there were some general patterns. The
terminology is a little tricky so I&#39;ve put all the definitions on your handout.
You&#39;ve probably got more definitions of sixteenth-century land ownership and
land holding than you will ever need, but they&#39;re down there in case you ever
want to refer to them. Basically, each manor was divided into what was
described as the demesne land and what was tenant land. If you look at your
handout, there&#39;s a map there of the manor of Laxton in Nottinghamshire. That&#39;s
almost right in the center of England. And you&#39;ll see on one side at the top
the demesne land and the village and then around it the great fields of the
manor in which the tenants held their land; the demesne and the tenant land. Demesne
land in the Middle Ages had been mostly cultivated by serf labor, that&#39;s to say
the labor of tenants who were not free and who held their land from the lord in
return for labor service on his land. By 1500, serfdom had died out in most
parts of England. It died out in the course of the late fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, still left to some extent over in parts of East Anglia but
it was mostly gone. By 1500, the demesne land tended to be let out by lords in
large units to yeoman farmers. As for the tenant land, some of it was held by
freehold, probably about a fifth overall. A freeholder owned his land, he
could leave it in his will, he could sell it, but he owed the duty of
&#39;recognition of lordship&#39; to the lord of the manor; he had to pay a small
annual sum to recognize such lordship. Most tenants, however, held their land
by what was described as &#39;customary tenure&#39;. That&#39;s to say the land was granted
out to them in the court of the manor, which would meet two or three times a
year, and they held it on terms &quot;according to the custom of the manor&quot;. </p>
<p>&quot;According to the
custom of the manor&quot;; that&#39;s a phrase that&#39;s often used. The custom of the
manor laid down their terms. These customary tenants were usually described as
&quot;copyholders&quot;. They held their land according to a copy of an entry in the
records of the manor court which was given to them as a record. Sometimes if
you go back through the deeds of a very old house you will find, by the time
you get back to sixteenth- and fifteenth-century deeds, a little strip of
parchment which is actually a copy of the original grant of the land on which
that house is built to a copyholder. Okay. Copyholders paid a down payment to
their lord called a fine. They paid an annual rent. They might hold their
land for a period of years like a modern lease or they might hold it for a
period of lives. That was a customary form by which you would take land for
the life of yourself, your wife, and your eldest child. The terms on which
they held their land might be fixed according to the custom of the manor, in
which case they were usually very fortunate, or they might be &#39;arbitrary&#39;;
that&#39;s to say they could be changed. So lordship and the relationship between
lords and tenants was a defining relationship in any rural community. It
created a local map of rights and of obligations. The particular pattern
represented usually a particular local working out of a kind of accommodation
between the power of the lord and what his tenants had been able to win with
him--win from him--or negotiate with him, and those terms were enshrined in
their local custom. So, given those realities, custom, and the notion of
custom, not surprisingly, is another keyword of the period, a very important
notion. </p>
<p>Custom, a word they
use constantly, was an accumulation of rules. An accumulation of rules about
what was considered to be right and proper in a particular place and the
correct procedures for maintaining and enforcing those rules. Custom laid
down, as I&#39;ve already said, the respective rights of the lord and the tenant
over the land. It also laid down the rules for the use of the common grazing
land of the manor. It laid down the rules for the settlement of disputes if
they arose between the tenants of the manor or between tenants and their lord. It&#39;s
been described as a lived-in environment of expectations which had grown up
slowly over time. Generally, people tended to argue when there was any dispute
that customs had existed &quot;time out of mind of man&quot;; that&#39;s another phrase
that&#39;s often used. Custom had governed their rules in that locality &quot;time out
of mind of man&quot;, and when there was a dispute they usually recruited the oldest
tenants they could find in order to pronounce on what they had known throughout
their sixty or seventy years of life, on what they&#39;d heard from their fathers
or their grandfathers, and so on to confirm the customs. In practice, in fact,
custom could be changed. It was subject to gradual modification over time if
all the tenants consented and it was malleable in accordance with changing
circumstances. Nevertheless, it carried this aura of antiquity. So at any one
time the operative custom in a particular place was the outcome of a kind of
adjustment amongst the tenants and between the tenants and their lord. </p>
<p>To this extent custom
was seen as being essentially the property of the tenant community. It
presupposed a community of interest amongst them, and it set the pattern of
expectations that provided the criteria for judging their relationships with
one another and their relationships with their lord. Was that relationship
with their lord equitable and legitimate according to custom? The word they often
used was &quot;reasonable.&quot; Was it reasonable? Was it maintaining custom
or, on the other hand, was it becoming oppressive or exploitative? And as a
result of all of this, in times of economic stress, such as were to come later
in the sixteenth century, custom could very often become a field of contest in
which lords and tenants staked competing claims about what the customs were or
should be. And this was very often to happen in the later sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries as we&#39;ll see when we come to consider peasant rebellion
and popular protest in this period. Very often it revolves around custom. </p>
<p>Okay. Well, let&#39;s
turn now to another aspect of the tenant community, the community of neighbors.
If custom was one key word in rural society, &quot;neighborliness&quot; was emphatically
another. Neighborliness was recognized as being a critically important social
virtue, and the word is constantly used as a kind of norm of good conduct. It
was of course based on residence near one another. The very word &quot;neighbor&quot;
derives from an Anglo-Saxon word, &quot;neah-gebur,&quot; which means
&quot;near dweller,&quot; literally &quot;near dweller.&quot; Neighborliness
was based upon residence, then, and it was conducted and developed through
frequent interaction amongst those who lived near one another and their mutual
recognition of obligations to one another of certain kinds. In part it was
created by the institutions and the customs of the manor which fostered a sense
of place and a sense of identity associated with that particular place. For example,
the manor court served as an instrument of self-regulation especially in the
organization of agriculture within the manor. </p>
<p>If you look at the
other side of the handout, you&#39;ll see the portrayal by the surveyor of Laxton
of one of the fields, and look at how those fields are--the field is divided up
into little strips of land, each of one is numbered--each one of which is
numbered. The tenants held their land scattered in strips across the field. The
numbers are there so that the surveyor could put down which pieces of land were
held by particular tenants in his survey book, and there at the edge of the
field is an area of common land which was used by all the tenants for grazing
their animals. The surveyor has portrayed various sheep grazing on it. It&#39;s a
particularly beautiful map, this map of Laxton, which was done in the early
seventeenth century. Well, that kind of arrangement, that kind of scattering
of land around the field, that sharing of common grazing land inevitably meant
that there had to be a good deal of cooperative organization of agriculture in
such a place, and the manor court provided the opportunities to pass bylaws
which enabled people to draw up the rules for their cooperative agriculture. Bylaws
were described in one contemporary law book as being made for the &quot;common
profit and with the assent of all.&quot; Ideally, you should have unanimity about
what they were and they governed not only cooperative agriculture but also the
mediation of disputes which arose and, if necessary, the punishment of
recalcitrant people. The aim, as one manor court book describes it, was that--I&#39;m
quoting it--&quot;all should concur in the keeping of good neighborhood one
with another in tilling, in laboring, in sowing, in shearing, in pasturing and
all other things pertaining to good and thrifty neighborhood.&quot; </p>
<p>Okay. That was the
ideal. Of course, it wasn&#39;t simply a happy world of peasant cooperation. In
any manor the bigger tenants, the ones who held the most land, tended to
dominate. There were plenty of disputes and arguments, but the constant stress
that they placed on the value of neighborhood, the constant appeals that were
made to that ideal, were certainly part and parcel of ensuring that these
arguments got resolved. One historian of this period has described community
as being in one sense belonging to the same argument and to the institutions
which helped to resolve it. There was a very strong expectation that
ultimately people would conform to a system which was ruled by custom in the interests
of ensuring the sustainability of the agriculture of the community as a whole
and the subsistence of its component households. </p>
<p>Well, so much for the
immediate economic dimension of neighborhood, but in addition neighborhood
involved of course much more than simply engaging in that kind of communal
agriculture, and in fact there were some areas of the country where that kind
of communal agriculture was much less significant. Already in the sixteenth
century there were some counties in which land wasn&#39;t held in great open fields
like at Laxton but was already divided up into the kinds of fields we associate
with the English landscape today, enclosed with hedges and ditches, each farmer
owning a certain number of fields or holding as a tenant a certain number of
fields and farming them according to his own wishes. That kind of agriculture,
enclosed agriculture, was already widely practiced in Kent, in parts of the
north of England, and in some parts of eastern England in the counties of
Suffolk and Essex for example, long established there, and it was to become the
norm throughout the whole country, as we will see. So the economic structure
of the manor and of neighborhood was of less significance in such places, but
everywhere neighborliness also found its expression in other forms. One form,
a very important form, was the ecclesiastical parish. </p>
<p>England was divided
up not only into units of lordship, the manor, but also into about ten thousand
ecclesiastical parishes which provided an additional unit of identity expressed
through people&#39;s collective worship in their parish church. Duties to one&#39;s
neighbor were of course a central element in Christian teaching. They implied
a certain universal moral obligation. Children were asked when they were
taught the church catechism, &quot;who is my neighbor?&quot; Everyone was your
neighbor, not only those who lived by you; a universal moral obligation. And
they were taught also that the second part of the Ten Commandments, four to
ten, involved duties to one&#39;s neighbor; the second table were duties to one&#39;s
neighbor just as the first table, the first few, were duties to God. The
church taught that one should love one&#39;s neighbor as one&#39;s self, which was of
course exceedingly hard to do sometimes, but the duty to try was reinforced in
many ways. At the ritual of the mass, the kiss of peace was part of the ritual
which expressed symbolically being in charity with your neighbors. Those who
were known to be out of charity with their neighbors could actually be excluded
from church services and in particular from the communion service until they
had reconciled themselves, reentered charity with their neighbors and were then
allowed to take communion. </p>
<p>The parish also
stimulated neighborly sentiments in other ways. The fifteenth and the early
sixteenth centuries saw a remarkable flowering of what&#39;s been described as
parish communalism; a whole world of activity centered on the church.<sup>2</sup>
It involved the rebuilding and beautification of many churches. Some of the
most beautiful parish churches surviving today were actually reconstructed in
this period, a period of relative prosperity in which parishioners invested in
their parish churches. It was a period of the founding of many parish
religious guilds. These were associations of parishioners sometimes drawn from
the entire community, sometimes particular sections: associations for the
women, associations for the young, associations for those associated with
particular manors and so forth, who maintained altars in the parish church,
maintained candles on those altars, had patron saints and owed duties to one
another. They prayed for one another. They looked after one another. It was
also a period which saw a flowering of elaborate ritual and festive life. A
great many of the traditional seasonal festivals which are recorded in early
sixteenth-century England had actually emerged in the course of this relatively
prosperous late medieval period. If this kind of aspect of traditional popular
culture interests you, there&#39;s a wonderful book on the subject by Ronald Hutton
called <i>The Rise and Fall of Merry England </i>in which he goes in to a great
deal of detail on these matters. </p>
<p>So whatever the
framework, whether we&#39;re talking about the manor or the parish or just living
close to one another, neighborhood found expression and it found expression
also of course in persistent face-to-face daily contact. The neighborhood was
a primary group. People knew each other exceedingly well. They knew one
another&#39;s business exceedingly well as was often revealed when they were called
upon to give evidence in court. Households interpenetrated one another in all
kinds of ways: assisting one another, borrowing from one another, lending to
one another, and a host of small-scale buying and selling. We get constant
glimpses of these interactions in the records that survive to us. One I
recently saw for example involved a woman who described how on one day she went
&#39;round to her neighbor to borrow a bowl of flour because she&#39;d run out and couldn&#39;t
get any at the mill. On another day she went &#39;round to see her neighbor to get
some burning coals from her fire so that she could start her own fire more
easily, this kind of constant little small change of daily interaction. We
know about these things because she happened to notice on her visits that her
neighbor was a little over-friendly with her lodger which resulted in an
adultery case in the church courts, and these little details of their
relationship, both positive and negative, are revealed. </p>
<p>We find neighbors
involved in arbitrating quarrels, in child minding, in visiting one another
when sick, in giving one another advice, in gossiping with one another, in
reproving one another. It&#39;s all well documented, involved in one another&#39;s
business to an extent which would be very unfamiliar today. It all adds up to
a tangled web of interpersonal obligation. Christopher Dyer, who has written a
wonderful book about part of the west Midlands, over here on the border with
Wales, did one study of the wills of fifteen families in a village in that
region between 1513 and 1540. He found that of the fifteen families some of
them were linked to as many as seven of the others by ties of debt and credit,
of god parenthood, of witnessing one another&#39;s wills, of leaving things to one
another in their wills, all adding up, as he describes it, to &quot;a close web of
friendship, of mutual regard, and of shared responsibility&quot;--and those are just
the relationships which happen to have left recorded evidence for historians to
see. </p>
<p>Well, drawing on
these ties could be crucial at times of particular need. This is a period
which lacks, as I&#39;ve said before, any form of life insurance or other forms of
insurance. Neighbors could provide a kind of social insurance. You find them
backing one another up. For example, when a couple were to be married it was
common for the neighborhood to gather to hold a &#39;bride-ale&#39;. Ale would be
brewed, people would come along, they would pay for the ale and the proceeds
would be given to the new couple. You also get &#39;help-ales&#39; when someone was in
need in another way. One [record] from the late
sixteenth century for example describes how a help-ale was organized for a
widow whose cow had died to provide her with a new animal, which was important
to her family economy. </p>
<p>Because these ties
could be so supportive, at best, there was a strong imperative amongst people
to maintain what they described as their &quot;credit&quot;, to maintain their credit in
the neighborhood, by which they meant their reputation in general, their
reputation for reliability, for honesty, for good conduct. It involved much
more than simply a sort of credit rating in a financial sense as we are
familiar with it today. It was a form, as I&#39;ve said, of social insurance in an
insecure world, and the price of good credit, the price of that element of
security, was conformity, conformity to the standards of the neighborhood. So
ties of neighborhood were something which one could also extend from the
countryside in to urban communities. In the town of Folkestone, which is down
here on the south coast in Kent, for example, one young woman who had been
recently married and was coming to the town with her husband for the first time
found that in the street where they were going to live the neighbors were
gathered. When she arrived they called out, &quot;where is she that will be
our neighbor?&quot; and drank to her. They had a barrel of beer ready to
welcome her. It matters in towns too, often at the level of the street. </p>
<p>The towns also had
distinctive institutions which you wouldn&#39;t find in the countryside. Most
towns had a very strong sense of identity as autonomous, self-governing
communities, especially those of them which actually had a charter from the
king which laid down their rights of self-government, those which were
chartered boroughs. The core members of these communities were the citizens
who held the freedom of the city and as freemen of the city were enabled to
participate in civic government. So in the city of York for example, up here
in the north, about half the male household heads of the city had the status of
freemen and were able to participate in the city&#39;s political institutions. In
the city of Norwich, over here in the east, it was about a third of the male household
heads. Citizenship was usually contingent on having served an apprenticeship
in a craft or trade, having served it to its end, become a member of a craft
fellowship or guild and consequently being admitted to the full freedom of the
city. </p>
<p>And the great men in
the political life of the cities were usually the chief officers of those craft
fellowships or guilds, especially the most powerful ones. Guilds varied in
number. The city of York had sixty-four. The much smaller city of Carlisle
over here in the northwest only had eight. It all depended on the size and
complexity of the urban economy, but their functions were essentially the same.
They regulated particular trades. They governed the taking on of apprentices,
how many apprentices could be admitted to the trade. They tried to keep
nonmembers of the guild out of practicing the trade. Such people were usually
described as foreigners, those who were not members of the guild and were
trying to get in on its particular activity. They controlled the business
practices of masters. They laid down the rules for good business practice and
they controlled labor relations and labors--and wages--between masters and
those who worked for them. But in addition the guilds had a host of social and
religious functions. Members of the guild were under obligation to relieve
other members of the guild who fell sick. They provided them with medical
care. They were under obligation to relieve members of the guild who became
unemployed. They provided for widows and orphans from charitable funds that
they maintained. It was obligatory for members of the guild to attend one
another&#39;s funerals and weddings. They were obliged also to pray for the souls
of dead brothers and sisters of the guild and they were obliged to attend
annual feastings and &quot;drinkings&quot; at which members of the guild would assemble
to celebrate their common fraternity. </p>
<p>All of this fostered
a very strong sense of fraternity or brotherhood. They constantly referred to
one another as brothers and sisters of the guild, the sisters being the wives
and daughters of members of the guild, and it created a strong sense of
identity both within a particular sector of urban economies and in the citizen
body as a whole. And in the citizen body as a whole it would be periodically
displayed in processions on important feast days in which the members of the
guild arrayed in their liveries--the colors of their guild, gowns in particular
colors--would parade in order; generally in order with their, of their,
precedence and importance within the city. When Queen Elizabeth I made her
first entry into the city of London in 1559, for example, the streets were
lined by the city guilds all in their liveries to greet the new queen. </p>
<p>Finally, the
fraternity and the brotherhood which was much stressed by the guilds and the
friendship which was fostered amongst neighbors, ideally, could both be
described as being extensions into social relations of the idiom of kinship. &quot;Friend&quot;
was often used in the sense we use it, a personal friend, but it also in the
sixteenth century meant a relative. It&#39;s still used in that sense in parts of
Ireland today. A friend was commonly a cousin, a brother-in-law and so forth. Brotherhood
and fraternity obviously involve comparison to a bond of kinship. </p>
<p>When one turns to
actual kinship, be it by birth or be it by marriage, that was, of course,
another bond that held together local society. The gentry of the countryside
were much linked together within particular counties by intermarriage. A close
social network can often be uncovered amongst gentry families who not only
lived within easy reach of one another but also sometimes formed, through their
marriage alliances, political alignments within the politics of their counties.
And we get the same sort of thing going on in the cities too especially amongst
the elite of the cities. In the city of Coventry, which is the greatest city of
the Midlands at this time, in Coventry there were twenty-four men who served as
sheriff of the city between 1517 and 1547. On closer examination, it turns out
that six of them were either fathers, sons or brothers of others who served as
sheriff, nine of them were interlinked by marriage into one another&#39;s families,
and another four were interlinked by ties of godparenthood. They&#39;d acted as
godparents of one another&#39;s children, establishing a bond of fictive kinship. </p>
<p>And more generally,
as you know from the reading for this week, the extent to which people in any
given settlement were actually related to one another was limited. People
moved around a good deal more than used to be thought. In most rural
communities one finds little knots of people related to one another but within
the context of a larger neighborhood of unrelated people, and beyond that there
would be a scattering of kin over a significantly larger area. Nevertheless,
if it wasn&#39;t the case that most village communities were heavily interrelated,
those close kin scattered around over what can be described as a social area
around a particular settlement undoubtedly possessed quite a strong sense of
obligation to assist one another. And across even larger areas one&#39;s kin could
form a broad resource of people who could be called upon with some expectation
of a positive response. If you hoped to apprentice one of your sons to a
nearby city for example, one of the best ways of doing that was to activate kin
living there who could help to prepare the way by finding a master to whom the
boy could be apprenticed. </p>
<p>Kin also helped one
another in finding suitable marriage partners and so forth. So kinship was
also one of the bonds which tied together social areas into communities. To
give just a small, petty example of the way in which kinship could function, we
have the record from the 1550s of an old lady called Christian Hatton. In her
old age when she was unable to take care of herself fully, she was cared for in
turn by kinsmen who lived in a number of settlements within walking distance of
one another. They shared the responsibility and periodically she walked
between the different households where she was going to live for a few months
at a time, taking with her her two cows. She had two cows. They were called
Browny and Fillpale. Fillpale was presumably a very good milker. We know
about these arrangements about Christian Hatton and her two cows because after
her death the relatives who had been helping her fell out over who was going to
get the cows, and so by this little accident of human frailty Browny and Fillpale
have entered the pages of history. [Laughter] </p>
<p>So let&#39;s put all this
together. It&#39;s been said that in late medieval and early modern society &quot;the
most fundamental of all bond... was that of mutual obligation.&quot;<sup>3</sup>
That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been talking about obviously. We have been looking at the
realities of those bonds. The institutions and the relationships that I&#39;ve
been surveying provided the basic coordinates of people&#39;s identities beyond the
household. They bound them together into networks of relationships in guilds,
in manors, amongst neighbors, amongst kinsmen, which provided those coordinates
of identity. Those ties were mostly local and they gave a strong flavor of
local particularity to the society and the culture of the time; a particularity
of place, a particularity of custom in that place, a particularity of known
faces and those with whom you regularly interacted, a particularity of
assumptions about shared values and proper behavior. In such a context
people&#39;s everyday dealings were very closely bound up with these direct,
face-to-face personal relationships. They were rarely anonymous. Indeed, they
can be said to have taken on a very strong moral character implicitly,
sometimes explicitly. </p>
<p>People were expected
to meet their obligations. They were enjoined to live in charity with one
another. They were reproved if they failed to do so. In many ways it&#39;s a very
attractive ideal and has some features, which clearly bear out some of the
assumptions of the sociological notions of community. But one should also
never forget that it could also be very demanding, very restrictive, very
excluding as well as including, and it was something which certainly couldn&#39;t
be taken for granted. Community insofar as it existed was always threatened
with potential conflict. It had to be worked at. It has been described as
being a form of constantly negotiated community amongst a set of well-known
people. </p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s a very
important aspect of the world I&#39;m trying to introduce to you. We should
certainly never sentimentalize it. If it was attractive in some ways, it could
be very demanding, very restrictive. It wasn&#39;t an idyllic pre-modern world. There
was plenty of conflict. There was personal rivalry and of course there were
differences of power. But at the same time it was a world that gave priority
to the needs of these collectivities as well as to those of individual
households, and the restraining bonds of these interpersonal obligations could
have a very powerful influence on how people conducted themselves and could
have a very powerful influence on how they understood and perceived and
responded to various of the changes which were to come in the course of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. </p>
<p>Okay. I&#39;ll leave it
there, and next time I&#39;ll go on to look at urban society more fully and the
network of connections which bound together the kingdom as a whole. </p>
