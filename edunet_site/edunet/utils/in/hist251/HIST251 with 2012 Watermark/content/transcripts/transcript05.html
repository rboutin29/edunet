<p><b>Professor Keith
Wrightson: </b>Right.
Well, today is the fourth and final of the contextual lectures introducing
sixteenth-century England. We&#39;ve looked at the social order, we&#39;ve looked at
households, institutions and relationships in local communities, and now I want
to look at the networks of connection that tie the whole thing together,
joining up the dots as it were, so it&#39;s a bit of historical geography or if you
like a kind of guided tour of sixteenth-century England, a bit of historical
tourism.</p>
<p>Well, last time I
stressed that local communities had a certain distinctive local peculiarity or
local particularity, which was partly constructed out of their local customs
and institutions. But it was also something that was influenced by the
different ways that they were linked together into the larger world. The
myriad of tiny local communities in this period was on the one hand a kind of
complex of places which were distinctive entities in their own right, but on
the other hand they were also integral parts socially and politically of larger
spaces, and it&#39;s those larger spaces and the ties that bound them together that
I&#39;m most concerned with today. </p>
<p>Okay. Well, amongst
the most significant of those larger spaces are what contemporaries referred to
as &quot;countries&quot;. They used that word not in the modern sense of a territorial
state but to mean a distinctive area, a landscape, a society, in some respects
a local culture. These countries as they thought of them could be quite
localized, for example on the Scottish border Teviotdale, or down in
Gloucestershire the Vale of Berkeley. These were regarded as distinctive
countries. Or they could use the term more broadly. People talked about the
North Country, they talked about the West Country; areas with less distinct
boundaries. When someone said in a letter, or in a political speech, or
whatever, that he was referring to the opinion of his country he was referring
to such a local area. </p>
<p>Such countries are
usually discussed by historians in terms of contrasting landscapes, physical
geography, and to a certain extent economic activity. If you look at map one,
the small relief map, you&#39;ll find that agrarian England was customarily divided
up into, on the one hand, the highland zone of the north and the west--you have
all the high land represented there, the highland zone--and on the other hand,
the lowland zone of the south and east. That&#39;s one way of perceiving these--the
broad distinctions that were noticed at the time and subsequently. On the
other hand, people sometimes make distinctions between what they called the &#39;fielden&#39;
areas, areas that practiced mixed agriculture, mostly lowland, and various
pastoral zones practicing mainly animal husbandry, and they could be of various
types. There were the open hill pastures of the highland. There were the
woodland pastures. Much of the west of England was still pretty densely
wooded, some parts of East Anglia as well, and they practiced a distinctive
pastoral husbandry focusing on dairying. And then finally there were the
pastoral practices of the fenlands, the areas of eastern England which were
waterlogged in winter and where for the most part the inhabitants practiced
pastoral husbandry. It&#39;s a very distinctive area in this period, flooded
during the winter, the inhabitants regarded as having an extremely distinctive
culture of their own. In fact, shreds of that continue. It&#39;s often said that
people from the fens have webbed feet. [Laughter] This is not
true. I had a roommate from the fens when I was a student and he definitely
didn&#39;t have webbed feet--though he was a good swimmer. </p>
<p>Well, this kind of
distinction in the physical geography can be extended to Scotland and Wales but
there&#39;s less variety. Scotland--two thirds of Scotland is highland. Only the
lowland zone between the Forth and the Clyde is really very good for
agriculture, for arable agriculture, and areas around the coast. Wales again
dominated by the central Cambrian massif, very difficult in this period to
travel north to south in Wales unless you go around the coast. Most of the
major routes traveled east to west because of the mountains. So it&#39;s less
varied. </p>
<p>Okay. If we turn to
another kind of distinctiveness, there&#39;s that associated with the practice of
various industrial activities in the countryside. That was a matter not so
much of the physical geography - though that could influence their location--but
dependent upon other factors. We think of this as the pre-industrial age, and
yet there were already some areas which were rendered distinctive by, for
example, the practice of mining and quarrying that clearly depended upon
geographical factors. You get lead being mined in the hills of Derbyshire or
in the hills of Somersetshire--down here--iron in the Forest of Dean and down
in Sussex, down here, and coal was produced especially around the River Tyne in
the northeast and in a scattering of other places across the countryside and in
South Wales. These industries were already established, and then there was
metal working. There was a great deal of metal working around the town of
Birmingham in the west Midlands which later grew into a great city, one of
England&#39;s greatest centers in the industrial revolution for light engineering. That
was based on its earlier metal working trade. When Henry VIII invaded Scotland
in 1523, he placed bulk orders for arrowheads from the smiths of Birmingham. They
supplied him. Sheffield was also very well known for its metal working; the
knives of Sheffield were very famous as indeed to some extent they still are. Most
people carried what they called a Sheffield whittle--a whittle-- a little knife
that you carried around with you to cut your food and it&#39;s from that name of
course that we get the practice of whittling--whittling wood--from a Sheffield
whittle. </p>
<p>Okay. Above all,
there was on a much larger scale the manufacture of woolen cloth, usually
manufactured in the putting-out system which I described to you; raw materials
put out by capitalist clothiers to workers who spun the wool into yarn, wove
the yarn into cloth in their own cottages scattered across the villages around
a major urban center. And that kind of organization in the putting-out system
of the cloth industry was very widespread indeed. Many of the villages of East
Anglia were heavily involved. Parts of Kent, lots of places in the West Country,
and a number of places scattered across the north were heavily involved in
manufacturing England&#39;s most famous product at this time, high-quality woolen
cloth. </p>
<p>All right. All
that&#39;s fine as a brief descriptive typology of different kinds of areas and
their distinctiveness. Physical geography goes only so far in explaining all
this variation. It&#39;s also to do with the--not only the physical attributes of
the area but also invisible factors; the patterns of connection, the patterns
of interaction, the flows of goods and people which gave areas distinctive
qualities. So, for example, to indicate what I&#39;m trying to express here, the
fact that the coal industry was centered on Tyneside (up here in the northeast
of the country) was not simply because coal was found there and was found near
to the surface where it could be reached with relatively simple technology. It
was also to do with the fact that it lay very close to the River Tyne, a major
navigable river, so the coal, which was bulky and difficult to transport, could
easily be put onto small boats called &#39;keels&#39;, brought down the river on to--and
loaded onto collier ships--which then transported it easily down the coast to
the cities along the coast and above all to the city of London. London could
never have grown as it did in this period if it hadn&#39;t had regular fuel
supplies brought at a reasonable price by coastal routes from the northeast. That&#39;s
why the northeast became the center of the coal industry whereas other areas
which had coal deposits were not yet exploited; they were too inaccessible. Well,
that&#39;s one example. One could think of others, but it&#39;s examining flows of
that kind that&#39;s crucial to understanding how particular localities developed
their special qualities and also the way in which they got articulated into
larger national systems. </p>
<p>So to understand all
of that one needs to look at these connections and the flows which linked local
societies together into the national whole. One could look--one can look--at
those connections in many ways. There are the connections which have to do
with the state and we&#39;ll look at them next week when I look at the early Tudor
monarchy and the reassertion of royal authority. There were connections to do
with the church and we look at them a lot in dealing with the Reformation, but
today I want to focus principally on connections through markets and through
flows of people, demographic flows across the countryside, and in particular
looking at them through the pattern of the urban system, the towns which helped
to organize and to some extent channel these flows. </p>
<p>Well, for analytical
purposes you can distinguish various levels of connection. There were local
market areas based on a small market town linking together the activities of
the villagers within particular countries. Secondly, there were regional and
interregional patterns of trade, and finally there were trading systems of
national or even international significance. Some--I&#39;ll touch on each of them
in turn.</p>
<p>Local market areas
were based upon small market towns. Within a particular country the rural and
the urban were not separate spheres. It&#39;s helpful to think of them as being
bound together by connections to a particular market town. All towns needed
the country&#39;s products of food and raw materials. The country depended upon
the towns to provide a place to trade and also for specialist manufactures,
specialist services of various kinds. So the essential unit to think of is the
market town and its hinterland, and one can distinguish various kinds of market
town. Some of them were really very tiny. The smallest ones were not very
impressive as urban entities. They were just large villages. They&#39;ve been
described as villages with an overlay of urban activities, market villages. One
person rather poetically has described these market towns as being &quot;foci in
time&quot;. They just came alive on market day. The rest of the time they&#39;re
pretty much just like any other village. Well, those are the settlements that
provided weekly markets and a range of specialist services. Most rural
villages would have a smith, a carpenter, a wheelwright, but there were other
crafts which needed a bigger market and so they tended to be located in the
market towns, people like coopers who made barrels or joiners who made furniture
and so forth. </p>
<p>To give you a
specific example, there&#39;s an area of the county of Suffolk called Babergh
Hundred. There&#39;s the name. That&#39;s how it&#39;s spelt. It&#39;s a delightful area of
the country. A recent survey by the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments
found that in that area no less than 24% of the houses date back before 1700. It&#39;s
got a remarkable level of survival of late medieval and early modern buildings,
which makes it delightful. You&#39;ve probably seen it many times in BBC shows. If
you want an ideal English village, that&#39;s the kind of place you&#39;d go to film
it. Well, Babergh Hundred: in 1522, there was a survey done of able-bodied men
which led them to listing the inhabitants and their trades and occupations. There
were thirty-two settlements in the area. Twenty-seven of them had only between
two and fourteen different occupations. Four of them had between eighteen and twenty-seven
occupations. They were the market towns. And finally there was one place
which had as many as forty-nine occupations. That was a big market town, the
town of Sudbury, the name which will be familiar to you no doubt. There are
many Sudburys in the United States.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Well, all market
towns, then, were essentially closely connected and part of the countryside
they served, they gained their living from it, but they also served to bind
those settlements into what you can think of as a kind of social area around
which people move on a regular basis. Just to take an example of this, there
was a small village called Kibworth Harcourt. It&#39;s in Leicestershire, around
about there. A study of Kibworth Harcourt&#39;s been done which shows that
Kibworth Harcourt lay within a day&#39;s walk of a variety of small market towns.
So here we are in Kibworth Harcourt; people who had different things to sell on
any given day of the week virtually could go out to a market town nearby and in
turn people were coming in from other villages to those market towns on
different market days. What you get is the interconnection of the whole area
of course. All the villagers from these different communities are gradually
intermingling in the marketplaces of these market towns. That&#39;s how a local
society meshed together. Contemporaries were very aware of this. In the
course of the Reformation when the attempt to Protestantize the country was at
its height, a good deal of attention was paid for example to preaching in
market towns. Preachers were appointed to preach in market towns. That was
how you reached the people. That&#39;s how you penetrated an area. </p>
<p>Well, in addition,
some market towns had a stronger role, the bigger ones like Sudbury which could
articulate patterns of interaction over a significantly larger area. One
historical geographer has described these as what he calls &quot;cardinal markets,&quot;
really important ones linking countries into sub regions. A very good example
is the town of Richmond in North Yorkshire which has been quite well studied. Richmond
was placed between the hills of the Yorkshire Dales, beautiful high country,
sheep country, wonderful place to go walking or hiking, and the Vale of York,
the lowland Vale of York. It channeled the relationship between those two
areas, the sheep and the dairy produce of the dales including the famous
Wensleydale cheese which you may have encountered. It&#39;s available in some
places in America; recommend it. A big wedge of Wensleydale on top of a slice
of apple pie eaten together is definitely one of life&#39;s more fulfilling
experiences. [Laughter] I would recommend it. It&#39;s a sort of--it&#39;s
a sort of--crumbly white cheese, tangy. The best Wensleydale is still made
from sheep&#39;s milk, originally made by monks from the monasteries in that region
but still produced. Anyway, [laughter] cheese, sheep, wool
coming down to Richmond where they meet the grain and cloth and other products
coming up from the Vale of York and that&#39;s the main center for exchange. In
1536, when the north rose against the Reformation in the rebellion known as the
Pilgrimage of Grace, Richmond was one of its major centers. Proclamations of
the rebellion took place at the market cross in Richmond. Again it makes
perfect sense. This is how you reached people. </p>
<p>Actually, speaking of
Richmond, only if you&#39;ll forgive a small divergence, when people visit Britain
they very often go to London, Oxford, Cambridge, maybe Canterbury Cathedral,
and then skip up to Edinburgh or whatever. It&#39;s well worth taking the time to
go to some of the provincial regions where you can see some lovely places. The
north is a very good example and Richmond is a splendid place to visit. It&#39;s
an almost perfect market town for the twelfth-century castle perched on a bluff
above the River Swale, delightful streets, mostly seventeenth- and
eighteenth-century, built in sort of yellowish sandstone, monastery ruins. It&#39;s
got everything and people--tourists--don&#39;t visit places like this very often. It&#39;s
well worth doing. If you happen to go to Richmond I would recommend near the
marketplace there&#39;s an inn called the Black Lion which does excellent lunches
[laughter] and, as you&#39;d expect in that part of the country, the
roast lamb is terrific but then they have modernized. They do now have
vegetarian options and they have wonderful beer. [Laughter] </p>
<p>The Black Sheep
Brewery is a small brewery in that area which is very well known and they
produce Black Sheep Bitter and also a most unusual bottled beer which is called
Riggwelter, which needs explaining. It&#39;s a dialect word. A riggwelter in the
dialect of this particular area of the north of England is a sheep which has
fallen on its back and can&#39;t get up again. [lLaughter] This
happens with sheep. They trip, they roll on their backs and then they lie
there waggling their feet, [laughter] and the shepherd has to
come and turn them up again. Well, that is--in the dialect of the area a sheep
like that is riggweltered; it&#39;s a riggwelter, and they call this bottled beer
Riggwelter [laughter] because if you consume it in unwise
quantities [laughter] it has exactly the same effect. [Laughter]
Anyway, I tell you this not to encourage you but to, you know--if you did
happen to go to that part of England to warn you against the possible
consequences. [Laughter] </p>
<p>Okay. Well, to get
back to the point, so we have significant market towns and they connect
villages into localities, localities into countries, countries into sub regions.
And that role is revealed in their recorded patterns of population mobility. As
you know, village populations were not rooted and immobile. People moved about
finding work as servants, marrying, taking up a tenancy of land that was
available and so forth, and to some extent you can trace the distances people
moved from their place of birth in the course of their lives. One study has
been done of Worcestershire, over here on the Welsh border, and that suggests
that people were generally living within ten miles of the place they were born,
so kind of moving around their country, and there are other similar studies. A
very good one was done of Kent of the geography of marriage, and it found that
half of the people in the study married people from their home parish, 70%
married people from under five miles, 84% married people from under ten miles,
and 95% married people from under fifteen miles from where they were born, and
again it gives a sense of the area in which people were moving around and where
they of course met marriage partners. </p>
<p>Okay. Well,
distances like that reflect the area of regular social interaction and movement
shaped by local markets and the towns where they were located, which created
social areas with their own distinctive identities and their own particular
orientations. I&#39;ve noticed since living in Connecticut that there&#39;s an
invisible wall across Connecticut which seems to divide Red Sox fans from
Yankees fans, which presumably has something to do with the kind of orientation
of people to different parts of the state, towards New York or towards Boston
so--and it&#39;s an example of the kind of thing I&#39;m talking about, the way in which
people&#39;s connections, where they go shopping, where they go for business and so
forth orient them in particular directions, and that&#39;s what created these
countries in sixteenth-century England too. </p>
<p>Okay. Let&#39;s move on.
In addition, there were some longer distance flows. The key commodities that
one finds in these interregional systems of connection and of interdependence
were of several kinds. There were foodstuffs. Not every area produced enough
food to feed its local population. You tend to get a flow of grain from the
south and east towards the north and west. A lot of it went up the coast for
example from East Anglia, and in reverse you get flows of animal products from
the pastoral areas of the north down to the south heading usually towards the
cities. Many cattle and sheep were driven in great herds having been assembled
in the market towns of the north and the west and Wales, driven down to London
in particular where they&#39;d be fattened up in the villages around London by
graziers before being sold to the butchers of the city. So you get flows of
that kind. You get flows of raw materials. The wool which was produced in
East Anglia or Lincolnshire or the north would find its way down to the woolen
industry in the west and the southeast.</p>
<p>And one gets other
things too. The luxury products which were traded over long distances, things
like wine and spices, fine-quality fabrics. They would tend to come in through
London or one of the major ports like Bristol and then be disseminated across the
countryside. Longer distance flows of foodstuffs, raw materials, luxury goods,
and indeed some less significant manufactured goods. The knives of Sheffield
were found everywhere in the country. If you visit London and are standing by
the river at low tide, you might notice people on the mud banks by the side of
the river putting mud into sieves and sieving it. They&#39;re known as mudlarks. They&#39;re
amateur archeologists. What they&#39;re doing is finding stuff in the mud which
fell out of people&#39;s pockets in London long ago. As you probably are aware,
the taxi system of sixteenth-century London was--were little boats on the
river. Watermen rowed people hither and thither and <i>Shakespeare in Love</i>
is a good example of that kind of thing if you&#39;ve seen that movie. Things fell
out of people&#39;s pockets when they were on the river and they can be found in
the mud. Anyway, one of the most common things the mudlarks find are Sheffield
knives. People carried a knife all the time and they would fall in the river and
they can be found and they end up in museums. </p>
<p>Well, longer distance
flows then. Any town could have a role in distributing goods over the longer
distance, but some had a particularly important role and they were of greater
than sub-regional significance. And the greatest of them are sometimes
described as being provincial capitals, places which in the early sixteenth
century would have a population over 5,000 or 6,000, which seems paltry to
modern eyes but was quite significant at the time, and which exerted influence
over a whole area of the country. To give a good example, York, effectively
the capital of the north of England. York was a city of ancient origin and
considerable importance. It was the great ecclesiastical center of the north. The
Archbishop of York was based there in York Minster, the wonderful cathedral. It
was the center of royal government for the north. The king&#39;s Council of the North
sat at York in the King&#39;s Manor, and York was also a natural point of exchange
for the largest county in the kingdom. </p>
<p>If you look at your
map of towns and counties, you&#39;ll see that Yorkshire--up here--by far the
biggest county. Well, York dominated the trading networks of the entire area. It
provided also all kinds of specialist services for the whole of the north of
England. If your church needed new bells, York was the only place you could
get a bell cast. If you wanted to buy a clock, you would probably need to go
to York. Not many clocks were manufactured, it was a very specialist occupation,
a tiny number of the greatest cities. If you wanted a book beautifully bound,
you would go to York. York had people like bookbinders serving the cathedral
and so forth. Its position on the River Ouse meant that it was also a town
which controlled a major artery of long-distance trade. The River Ouse runs up
from the city of Hull on the coast up into North Yorkshire and along the river
would pass many goods being landed at Hull and coming up into the area, or
coming down the river and then being shipped to national and international
markets. </p>
<p>Any of the really
great cities of the time had that same kind of role. Norwich was in effect the
capital of East Anglia and was the second largest city at the time. Bristol, in
effect the capital of the West Country. Chester, very significant also to the
north of Wales and controlling trade with Ireland, and so one could go on. Newcastle
up in the northeast also very significant, strategically important, close to
the Scottish border. Just as patterns of population mobility within particular
localities indicate the local social areas within which people moved, so the
patterns of migration to the really great cities tell us about their regional
and interregional significance. For Norwich, for example, there are surviving
lists of apprentices and where they came from, the young men who came in to
learn a trade. They came from all over East Anglia, the whole region, and
indeed from further afield. Norwich was important enough to pull people in
from the Midlands, and the same sort of thing is true of other areas that can
be studied in that way. In Bristol a similar study shows that the apprentices
came from all over the west Midlands and they came from--let me just check the
figure--thirty-seven different towns and villages of which twenty-five were
actually located on the River Severn which runs up like that. It&#39;s pretty
obvious what was going on here. These places were particularly connected to
Bristol through the river trade and people were coming down river to start
their careers in Bristol as apprentices. Bristol also drew apprentices from
Wales and from the southwest of England. </p>
<p>Okay. Okay. Cities
such as Bristol or York or Norwich were already places of national
significance. They focused entire regions and bound them together into the
national unit and they channeled inter-regional trade, but the final element of
the kind of articulation that I&#39;m talking about, of course, is at the ultimate
national level and that&#39;s provided above all by the capital city, London. As
you know from your reading, the English urban system in this period was rather
polarized. There was only one city with more than 15,000 population in the
early sixteenth century and that was London. Nowhere else could come near
rivaling London. In the 1520s, London already had a population of 55,000,
which made it something like four times the size of Norwich, and it was
growing. Indeed, it was to grow to a population of something like 200,000 by
the last decades of the sixteenth century. London was the biggest marketing
center for food and raw materials. London--supplying London meant farmers all
over eastern and southern England were sending their goods towards the capital
city. There was a lot of road traffic. There was also river traffic down the
River Thames, coastal traffic bringing goods to where they could be landed to
supply London. </p>
<p>London was also the
biggest supplier of goods that were desired elsewhere in the kingdom. It was
the biggest center of manufacturing of all kinds of things which would be sent
out to cities and towns elsewhere in the kingdom. It was the biggest supplier
also of all kinds of specialist services which weren&#39;t readily available
elsewhere. London had a lot of lawyers for example. If you wanted legal
business done, London was the place to go. London was where the royal courts
met, hearing the most important court cases. London was the place which had a
lot of proper university-trained physicians if you had medical problems. It
was very rare to find a physician like that out in a small town. So it was the
place to go for all kinds of things. An almost ridiculous example: if you were
a great nobleman or a gentleman and you wanted to have a grand renaissance tomb
erected in your parish church in preparation for your death. And lots of them
did this. They even wrote the inscriptions themselves while they were still
alive saying what wonderful guys they&#39;d been, [laughter] and if
you wanted something like that and you could afford it, London was the place
that you got it. That&#39;s where the stone masons were who would do something
like that. They were manufactured in London, to order, and then shipped out in
pieces to wherever they were to be erected and then they would be erected by
local masons in a parish church somewhere else in the kingdom, just--it&#39;s true
but it&#39;s a silly example in a way, but it makes the point. </p>
<p>Right. Above all,
London was the great center of international trade. The dominance of London
was based upon the fact that it was so close to the crossing across to the
Netherlands. You can have a short voyage across the North Sea to the cities of
the Netherlands and above all the city of Antwerp, which should be marked on
the bottom corner of your map but seems to have gotten lost in the Xerox
machine in some cases. London was the major market for English cloth which was
exported abroad and it was the principal place where imports were landed. In
fact, woolen cloth alone made up two thirds of English exports in the early
sixteenth century. Two thirds of English exports were woolen cloth, and at
least half of that cloth went to the Continent through London. It was gathered
in London from all over the north and the west of England and from Wales and
exported in fleets of ships organized by a company called the Merchant
Adventurers. </p>
<p>In return, all kinds
of goods were brought back especially from the Netherlands: luxury textiles,
fine-quality linen, silk, miscellaneous manufactures which were not made in
England, pins for example. They didn&#39;t manufacture pins in England. They came
from Holland. Starch--they didn&#39;t manufacture starch; that came from the
Netherlands too. Paper--there were no paper manufacturers in England. The
book trade, based in London of course, depended upon imports of paper from the
Netherlands and then there were all sorts of groceries, olive oil, fruit,
spices, sugar, wine. A great deal of this came via the Netherlands. The
Netherlands was the great trading area of northern Europe with its cities,
notably Antwerp, and they connected the trade of Scandinavia, the Baltic in the
north, to trade down the Atlantic coast and to the Mediterranean. And also the
river routes of Europe which culminated in the Netherlands, like the Rhine, all
brought in goods. The Netherlands was the center and England was connected to
world trade via the Netherlands. </p>
<p>I keep mentioning
Antwerp. Antwerp was the center of all of this and its importance was very
well recognized. It was with Antwerp that the English traded above all. It&#39;s
no accident that when Sir Thomas More in 1517 wrote his book, <i>Utopia, </i>he
sets it in Antwerp where he presents himself on an embassy to Antwerp, which
actually took place, talking to the sailor Raphael Hythloday who tells him the
story of the wonderful land of Utopia which he&#39;s located in his voyages to the
west. Other things came from the Netherlands too; ideas. It was one of the
major centers for the smuggling of early Protestant books into England from the
1520s onwards, for example. </p>
<p>So London&#39;s dominant
position was reflected in the fact that it had a truly national migration
field. A study&#39;s been done of 1,000 new freemen of the city in 1551 to 1553,
young men completing their apprenticeship and becoming freemen of the city. Only
a fifth of them had been born in London or the metropolitan area itself. A
quarter of them came from the southeast and East Anglia, a quarter of them came
from the Midlands, a quarter of them came from the north, and then there were a
scattering of others from different parts of the kingdom, relatively few from
the southwest. Probably the importance of Bristol meant that young men from
the southwest went there rather than to London, but London&#39;s catchment area was
truly national. </p>
<p>Well, this
description and analysis of marketing structures and the way they&#39;re
articulated perhaps gives a sense of the integrated nature of a system of
exchange already in the early sixteenth century, and so it was. It&#39;s not
difficult to imagine a merchant sitting in his counting house in Bristol
perhaps eating some salt fish which would have been caught off the coast of
North Wales. It would have been packed into barrels which were made with
barrel stays which probably were imported from Ireland via Chester. It would
be salted with salt which was produced in the county of Cheshire nearby. If
he&#39;s accompanying it with a little wine, that would have come from southwestern
France and was probably landed in Bristol. If he was drinking that out of a
pewter goblet, the pewter would have been made with lead from the Mendip Hills
and tin from Cornwall probably actually produced by craftsmen working in
Bristol itself. And maybe he&#39;s wearing a nice gown to keep the drafts off which
would be fine-quality worsted cloth from Norwich. And if he&#39;s got a fine linen
shirt because he&#39;s very well off, it would be Netherlandish linen. That was
the best; the cheap stuff came from England and Lincolnshire. And if he&#39;d
starched his collar, the starch would have come from Antwerp probably. Let&#39;s
have him cut his fish up. He uses a Sheffield knife. [Laughter]
</p>
<p>Okay. Well, it&#39;s easy
to imagine that. That--it mattered that those connections existed and they did
exist, but we also finally just have to appreciate the limits of that kind of
sophisticated commercial interconnection. Remember what I&#39;ve said before: this
was still primarily a rural world in which people lived within relatively
contained areas and focused mostly on a little bit of local exchange and
producing their own subsistence. So most people most of the time had only
limited connections to these larger flows, to these larger commercial networks.
The people who were really involved with them were distinctive groups in
society: townspeople of course, especially the inhabitants of the greater
cities; to a lesser extent also the inhabitants of those areas like the
industrial areas which were producing goods for longer distance trade; the big
commercial farmers who were involved in longer distance marketing of grain or
cattle, and a variety of middlemen who conducted that trade. And finally
deeply involved in all of this were the social elites. They were the people
who consumed the luxuries. They were the people who went down to London to
attend the royal court from time to time. They were the people who had truly
national social networks with their equals as members of the elite. But the
point is that the intensity of the integration varied a lot. </p>
<p>It varied socially;
it varied geographically. Some areas were probably pretty densely connected
and commercialized, the southeast in particular. It has more towns, it&#39;s more
heavily populated, it has a better road system, and so forth. Other areas were
less closely interconnected. Some of the longer distance connections I&#39;ve
described were flowing across areas where people&#39;s lives were in fact much more
contained on a day-to-day basis. When historians try to conceptualize the
whole thing they have to try to express both the reality of the
interconnections and their importance but also their limits, the continuing
importance of localism within your country. People talk about an elaborate
mosaic of interlocking local societies. They talk about what was still a
highly territorialized society, although a national society also. They talk
about an amalgam of different local societies at different stages of
development all influencing each other, and yet often a world in which old ways
coexisted with the new. Well, both dimensions of the picture have validity. Commercial
relations have a vital place, and yet many local societies and economies were
still to a great degree autonomous or semiautonomous. </p>
<p>All in all, it could
be described as not yet a fully integrated commercial society but a traditional
agrarian world with a limited commercial sector. Within that commercial sector
the predominant flows tended to be from the north and the west towards the
south and the east, but to imagine it as being simply a dynamic advanced
southeastern core and a rather backward northern and western periphery doesn&#39;t
do justice to the more distant provinces. It&#39;s better, I think, to think in
terms of certain core activities which are to be found all over the kingdom
though they tend to be somewhat more concentrated in the south and east. But
those outposts and those connections really mattered. They exercised a degree
of leverage in local economies, on local cultures, and on local politics. </p>
<p>So we have a set of
local societies, local economies, even local cultures with important elements
of linkage. It&#39;s those links, those connections, that get activated and get
elaborated by some of the really significant developments of this period, the
commercial developments, of course, most obviously perhaps, but it&#39;s also
through those same links and connections that people in distant areas of the
kingdom became involved in some of the other major changes of the period, the
so-called educational revolution, the growth of literacy, religious change,
political change. What I&#39;ve been talking about really is essentially a framework
of communication which is central to economic life, to cultural life, to the
political dynamism of the period. And finally the national society as a whole
was one which was created not only by those ties, vital as they were, but also
by other forces, by political forces and by religious forces, and it&#39;s those
that I&#39;m going to turn to next week when we come at last to look at the
activities of the early Tudor kings and to what was going on in the church on
the eve of the Reformation. So context done, hopefully it will help you to
understand the dynamics of change which we turn to next. </p>
