<p><b>Professor Keith
Wrightson: </b>Right.
Okay. Let&#39;s begin today with a few apparent paradoxes. In one of my earlier
lectures I quoted to you at length from the--[laughter]. Okay. Okay.
That gives authenticity, right? [Laughter] Okay. Start again.
I quoted to you at length from the Tudor <i>Homily on Obedience </i>first
published in 1547 with its stress on hierarchy, degree, order, subordination,
and obedience. And yet as you know within two years of the publication of that
homily in 1547 there was a wave of peasant protest in 1549 right across the
south of England and open rebellion in East Anglia, Kett&#39;s Rebellion. </p>
<p>This was a society in
which the common people below the level of the &#39;middling sort&#39;, the leaders of
village society, had no formal political voice. They were, as Sir Thomas Smith
put it, &quot;to be ruled over and not to rule others,&quot; and yet not infrequently we
find those same common people raising their voices in protest and sometimes in
demand. It was a society in which the gentry rulers regarded their social
inferiors with a great deal of condescension. The language they used to
describe them says it all: the &quot;meaner sort of people,&quot; &quot;the clowns,&quot; &quot;the
ruder sort,&quot; &quot;the rabble.&quot; And they expected their deference. Men were
expected to uncover their heads before their social superiors, do them &quot;hat
honor,&quot; as it was called, women were expected to bob a curtsy, and yet this
condescension on the part of the gentry was tinged with anxiety and an
expectation of insubordination. As one of them, Sir John Oglander, put it, &quot;the
common people are always apt to rebel and mutiny upon the least occasion.&quot; </p>
<p>Well, how can one
reconcile all of these paradoxes? Well, maybe the answer is in fact simple
enough. Deference and obedience was the norm, it was instilled by precept, it
was learned by repeated daily experience, and yet periodically it could perhaps
be destabilized by circumstances; a famine perhaps, a particularly callous
example of exploitation by a landlord. Things like that could perhaps render
people desperate, leading them to rise in a convulsive spasm of anger and
despair, and when that happened all good order could be threatened by the mob,
what the gentry called the &quot;many-headed monster,&quot; the common people, &quot;the beast
with many heads.&quot; </p>
<p>Well, it&#39;s a powerful
image and not without historical foundation, and yet to characterize all or
even most forms of popular disturbance in early modern England in this way is
profoundly misleading. A generation of research on popular protest has shown
just how inadequate that stereotype is, and the resulting shift of perception
amongst historians is reflected in the kind of language they now use to describe
these things. People nowadays talk little about &#39;the mob&#39;; they talk more
about &#39;the crowd&#39;. They talk less about &#39;revolt&#39; and more about &#39;protest and
resistance&#39;. We&#39;ve moved from the study of &#39;riots&#39; to the study of what people
term &#39;popular political culture&#39;. Now whether that term is fully justified
we&#39;ll see, but the evidence at least reveals that the common people were
neither unconditionally deferential to their rulers nor on the other hand were
they secretly alienated from the existing social order, but rather, as one
laboring man from Northamptonshire in the English Midlands put it on one of
these occasions, they could--to quote him, they could &quot;tell well enough how to
devise a means to help themselves.&quot; And they could do that within the
parameters of the prevailing structures of power and authority within which
they were obliged to work because as yet no one had suggested any possible
alternative. </p>
<p>Popular protest has
been well described by John Walter as being in the first instance a &quot;politics
of subsistence,&quot; a politics of subsistence. Its most immediate objectives were
frequently the defense or the amelioration of a threatening economic situation.
The most obvious case of that was in the case of food riots. These tended to
occur in years of dearth; bad harvest years when grain was in short supply and
the prices of food rocketed, years like 1587, 1594 to &#39;7, 1622 to &#39;3, 1631,
1647 to &#39;8, and so on. These riots also occurred in years of industrial
depression when rural industrial workers in particular who were dependent upon
the market for most of their food supplies found that they lacked the income to
supply themselves because their employers were no longer able to put out work
to them. The 1620s saw some very bad industrial depressions of that kind. </p>
<p>Well, either
circumstance, a bad harvest or a year of industrial slump, could produce a
sudden and catastrophic decline in what economists refer to as people&#39;s
&#39;exchange entitlements&#39; as consumers, or in plain English, they were unable to
afford the food that they needed. Agrarian disturbances were rather less
predictable, but they occurred sporadically and occasionally in areas, or
individual communities, where the manorial tenants, or the local population
more generally, were confronted with changes which threatened to undermine the
viability of particular patterns of local rural economy.</p>
<p>So, in 1536, as you
know, part of the causes of the Pilgrimage of Grace rising were protests
against the pushing up of entry fines for land in parts of northwestern
England. In 1549, Kett&#39;s Rebellion was rooted in protests against the
exploitation of landlords&#39; grazing rights. But above all in the late sixteenth
and early seventeenth centuries the grievance which motivated protests was
enclosure; enclosure of the land which extinguished rights of common pasture;
pasture rights which were particularly valued. So, for example, in the small
town of Berkhamstead, which is just to the north-west of London in the county
of Hertfordshire, in 1618, several villages existed around a very large area of
common land on which they all had rights to graze their cattle and sheep; they
had rights to put their pigs into the woodland; they had rights to gather fuel
and wild fruits and to capture small animals for the pot, rabbits in
particular. The loss of all that, when attempts were made to enclose
Berkhamstead common, were deeply resented, and that&#39;s the kind of situation
that so often occurred. Now situations of that kind occurred sporadically
though sometimes they also came in clusters. </p>
<p>In 1607, there was a
wave of enclosures in villages where the three counties of Northamptonshire,
Warwickshire, and Leicestershire met in the Midlands up here. That was known
as the &#39;Midland Rising&#39; because there was a kind of scattering of riots across
the whole area. Or again in 1628 to 1632 there occurred what&#39;s known as the
&#39;Western Rising&#39; in the forested areas of the west of England. Those areas
were being disafforested and cleared and the land turned into enclosed farms,
and much resistance sprang up amongst those who had formerly enjoyed common
rights in the woodlands. And finally in the--from the 1630s, in response to
the drainage of the Fenlands of eastern England and the allocation of reclaimed
land in enclosed farms to those who invested in that improvement, there was a
wave of resistance. The people of the Fens to the south of the Wash and in
Lincolnshire lost, as a result of the drainage, their grazing rights, their
fishing rights, their wildfowling rights, the rights to gather rushes and turf
for thatch or fuel, and they bitterly resisted these changes in the so-called
&#39;Fenland Riots&#39; which actually sputtered on for over thirty years. </p>
<p>Okay. So we&#39;re
dealing primarily with forms of protest against, or forms of resistance to,
circumstances which had a detrimental effect upon the household economies of
the inhabitants of particular districts, and those circumstances were felt at
one time or another all over England and Wales. But there was also rather more
to it than that, although it took historians quite a while to appreciate the
fact. When people first started looking closely at the records which survive
relating to these events, the most immediately striking thing about the
evidence was that these risings, revolts, or riots were in fact relatively
restrained and relatively purposefully directed. </p>
<p>Perhaps we&#39;d been
misled by the very term &quot;riot,&quot; which was often used to describe them in the
legal records. That word of course conjures up an image of lurid breakdown of
order, but in fact in English law a riot was simply an unlawful act committed
by three or more people who had assembled for the purpose. As a result, the
reality of those events which are described conventionally as &#39;riots&#39; could be
much less harrowing than the image which the term tends to conjure up in our
minds.</p>
<p>So, take food riots
for example. First of all, they were by no means an automatic response to the
existence of a dearth or scarcity of food. They were in fact relatively few
even in pretty bad years. Their form was also relatively restrained. Crowds
didn&#39;t simply seize food from anyone who had a stock of food to be seized; the
gentry or big farmers with well-stocked barns, for example. In fact, food
riots were almost exclusively directed at middlemen in the grain trade. They
were almost entirely directed against corn dealers. Again, crowds involved in
these riots rarely stole food and took it away. More likely they involved the
stopping of middlemen who were transporting grain which they had bought up in
bulk in the market and forcing them to sell it to the crowd at prices below the
inflated market rate; that&#39;s to say at prices which local people thought they
could afford. And finally they very rarely involved violence against people. Quite
often food riots involved, or were even led by, women who could be quite
violent in their language and their threats but rarely physically violent. The
object was to prevent the removal of grain, to keep it in the area, and to
force those who had it to sell it to local people, rather than to attack them
personally. </p>
<p>So essentially it
appears to be the case that these were protests against dysfunctions in the
developing internal traffic in foodstuffs. Such a trade, especially in grain,
was essential to supply England&#39;s growing cities and those areas of the
countryside which are often described as &#39;dependent areas&#39; which didn&#39;t produce
enough grain for the local population&#39;s needs. But the system of internal
trade which was developing was not yet sufficiently well developed to iron out
regional inequalities in the supply of foodstuffs which was available in bad
years, and in addition that system offered opportunities or temptations to
evade the law. </p>
<p>The law stated that
the poor should always be served first in the market, at prices which were
agreed by the market officers as reasonable, before large-scale commercial
dealers were allowed to participate. Yet that law was frequently flouted. In
Hertfordshire for example to the north of London, in 1598 the local justices
had to deal with the major problem of large-scale dealers who were supplying
the London food market intercepting grain before it ever came to the local
markets, buying it on the road and removing it immediately to London. Problems
of that kind could provoke a great deal of local resentment.</p>
<p>And this kind of
situation helps to explain the geography of food riots. They tended to take
place in or near market towns in heavily populated areas with many consumers
dependent upon those markets. They took place in or around market towns of
food-exporting areas where the local poor witnessed commercial dealers buying
up supplies at prices which they couldn&#39;t afford, in order to ship the grain
elsewhere. And they occurred in areas that such dealers passed through on
their way to major urban markets. In particular, one finds a lot of food
rioting in the market catchment area of London, in the southeast, and in the
southwest around the great city of Bristol; similarly to a lesser degree around
Norwich in East Anglia. So these actions were aimed at rectifying quite
specific forms of local grievance, a sense amongst local populations that they
were being exploited by middlemen in the grain trade and abused. Where there
was no such grievance the poor seemed simply to have tightened their belts in
bad years or even in some parts of the north and far west to have starved
quietly. And those of them who did take action usually did it in a fairly
purposeful manner, focusing on achieving a specific end--supplying their own
needs at prices that they could afford. Defending, one could say in the
jargon, their &#39;exchange entitlements&#39;. </p>
<p>Well, similarly,
agrarian disturbances present a less lurid picture than the one conjured up by
the word &quot;riot.&quot; They certainly often involved large crowds of people who had
assembled together to prevent an enclosure, or to reverse it, or to prevent the
drainage of Fenland, or to reverse it, and so forth; knocking down hedges and
fences, blocking drainage works and so forth. But they were also relatively
orderly. Surprisingly often agrarian riots were announced in advance. They
were even sometimes preceded by meetings in the local manor court or in the
church at which the tenants would agree upon their action. In one village for
example called Ryton, R-y-t-o-n, up in the northeast of England, in 1607, the
manor court actually required all tenants to turn up with a spade or an ax in
order to take down an enclosure to which they objected. They even laid it down
in the manor court, as a bylaw, that any tenant who failed to turn up to take
part would be fined six pence. </p>
<p>Sometimes these
actions were initiated having been agreed upon by a public signal, quite often
the tolling of the church bells. They frequently involved the gathering of
whole communities: men, women, and children together. Sometimes they were led
by local notables. Sometimes the minister of the parish might be the leader. Sometimes
they were led by parish or manorial officers, or members of the manorial jury. Sometimes
they even enjoyed the tacit support of sympathetic local gentlemen, who might
themselves be losing out from a particular enclosure and were content to
encourage some action against it, even though they rarely took part themselves.
One of the reasons that Oliver Cromwell was so popular in eastern England, in
the Fenlands that he came from, was the fact that in 1628 he had defended the
rioters in the Fens in Parliament against the innovations that they were
protesting against. He was known as the &quot;Lord of the Fens&quot; for his popularity
in the area. It didn&#39;t hurt when he later recruited his regiments there. </p>
<p>Riots often involved
a strong element of ritual. Frequently, they involved the ritual removal of a
fence or a hedge. Sometimes those who pulled down fences or hedges did it two
at a time to avoid the legal definition of a riot as an illegal act committed
by three or more persons. Sometimes the youth, or the women of the community,
were to the fore in this action in order to evade severe punishment. It was
thought that they would be held less culpable. Sometimes hedges were pulled
down by men dressed as women, and this transvestite element in the ritual of
rioting is quite fascinating. It perhaps symbolized a world turned upside
down. No one could have deceived themselves that these were actually women. They
had beards for a start. [laughter] But they dressed as women
sometimes, perhaps symbolizing a world turned upside down. </p>
<p>Fences and hedges
once they were destroyed were sometimes sawn up and burned, or even ritually
buried. Sometimes the land returned into tillage was ritually plowed to
symbolize its return to the manorial community, or sometimes where it was
common pasture which was being defended, animals were put back onto it by the
villagers in order to symbolize their reclamation of their common pasture. And
quite often all of this might be accompanied by a rather festive atmosphere. Cakes
and ale were frequently prepared to be enjoyed afterwards, often around a
bonfire. Music sometimes accompanied the proceeding. There might be dancing. In
the Fenlands they enjoyed a game which was known as &quot;Fenland football.&quot; This
was the original form of football in which large crowds of young men simply
chased across the countryside kicking an inflated pig&#39;s bladder. In the
Fenland when they got together for Fenland football, they kicked it across the
countryside and destroyed every drainage ditch that they passed in the course
of chasing the ball. </p>
<p>It&#39;s interesting also
that these actions often took place upon festival days. The rising in the
Midlands in 1607 started on May Day. Shrove Tuesday in February was often a
popular date. It was a time known for village games which involved rituals of
inversion, turning the world upside down for a day. Another popular occasion
was Rogation Day, the day on which people perambulated the boundaries of the
parish to note the parish boundaries, and that&#39;s something I&#39;ll return to. And
again, agrarian risings of this kind very rarely involved violence against
people. The crowds might appear very threatening. There were rarely any
injuries to individuals. Indeed, those against whom the crowd were rioting or
protesting very often kept out of the way. </p>
<p>So what we&#39;re dealing
with are occasions which were often very highly targeted and very purposeful
affairs, rather than outbreaks of anarchy and unrestrained violence. It&#39;s
equally evident that they were expressive of a kind of moral order, which
involved not just defense of the material interests of the community, important
as that was, but expressed also a set of values: what E.P. Thompson in a famous
phrase described as the &quot;moral economy of the crowd,&quot; by which he meant a
popular consensus about the nature of legitimate and illegitimate practices in
economic life, involving notions of the proper behavior expected from different
sections of the community, and asserting notions of certain popular rights in
the economic sphere. Rioters do indeed very often seem to have been infused
with a strong sense of the rectitude of their acts. They were sustained in
that by certain legitimizing ideas. </p>
<p>As one might expect,
in agrarian disturbances the vital legitimizing idea was that of custom. As
you know, in any individual manor, custom constituted a kind of local lived-in
environment of norms and usages, a collection of rights which people believed
to have existed &quot;time out of mind to which the memory of no man is to the
contrary,&quot; in the phrase they often used; &quot;time out of mind.&quot; And to that
extent custom provided a powerful legitimating rhetoric for actions of this
kind. For example, in 1630 when the tenants of one manor in the southwest of
England defended their claim to pasture rights in the forests they were able to
produce ten witnesses whose average age was seventy-eight, quite
extraordinarily old people for this period, who testified to the existence of
their customs in the woodlands during their own long lives and in those of
their fathers and of their grandfathers, as they had been told when they were
children.</p>
<p>But in the changing
circumstances of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries custom had
become not only a set of long-established rights and practices but also, in a
time of change, a potential arena of conflict between landlords and tenants. If
the tenants were trying to defend what they took to be the antiquity and
reasonableness of customs which protected their interests, many landlords were
anxious to explode those claims, or to persuade people, or to pressurize
people, into removing customs which inhibited what they saw as &#39;improvement&#39; of
their estates. With that kind of conflict of interests, when push came to
shove the notion of the sanctity and wisdom of custom strengthened the arm of
those who tried to resist claims against local customs which were detrimental
to their interests. </p>
<p>In the case of
enclosure, they saw themselves also as resisting a kind of innovation which had
been declared illegal by various statutes throughout the sixteenth century. The
laws against enclosure in fact were repealed in 1624, but the fact that
enclosure had for long been declared illegal by Parliament was remembered, and
that again gave a sense of legitimacy. And some rioters could even claim a
higher authority. As I mentioned, very often enclosure riots took place on
Rogation Day. That was the day when traditionally the older members of the
village community gathered together with some of the youngest members, in
particular young boys, to walk the boundaries of the parish, to &#39;beat the
bounds&#39; as it was called. The Church of England even had a special homily for
Rogation Day and it had some significant texts. One of them was Deuteronomy
27:17: &quot;cursed be he that removes his neighbor&#39;s landmark.&quot; Another was
Proverbs 22:28: &quot;remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set.&quot; The
rituals of walking the boundaries of the parish were all about such landmarks,
they were all about such boundaries, such common territories and their
sanctity, and they tried to impress upon the young boys who were part of the
procession, where exactly the boundaries were. There were various rituals
involved in this. If a boundary involved a stream, then one of the boys might
be thrown in the stream to help him remember where it was.
[laughter] It was common if there were boundary stones to get
one of the boys to touch the stone with his finger after which the finger was
twisted by one of the older men to give him a sharp pain to remind him. One
village practiced sitting little boys on the stones with their bare bottoms. They
sometimes even struck a child at particular boundary spots so that they would
remember the place. It was all part of the ritual. If such occasions
sometimes ended with purposeful attacks upon new-fangled boundaries which had
been erected in the form of enclosure and which excluded local inhabitants from
formerly common land, then they may very well have had a sense of divine
approval for what they did in defending their boundaries. </p>
<p>As for food rioters,
they had a strong enough sense of their own right to have food available at
reasonable prices. When she was asked what had motivated her to take part in
the stopping of a grain shipment in 1629, one woman from Essex said it was, to
quote her, &quot;the cry of the country and my own want&quot;; &quot;the cry of the
country and my own want.&quot; Grain rioters could also claim, with some
justification, to be merely enforcing the law. They could see themselves as
engaging in a kind of mass citizen&#39;s arrest of grain dealers who were breaching
market regulations, or they could see themselves as enforcing the regulations
supposed to be put into effect in times of scarcity which the local magistrates
should have enforced. And frequently grain riots broke out where the
magistrates had been slow to do so. </p>
<p>So then, rioting
crowds had an empowering sense of the rectitude of their actions. But of course
they weren&#39;t simply disinterested upholders of custom and law. They were also
defending their own interests, and in that endeavor riot was a tactic in a kind
of negotiation with local authorities. Very often food riots were preceded by
petitioning; petitioning the local magistrates to act to relieve distress and
to put into operation scarcity regulations. It was commonly the case, as I&#39;ve
already observed, that such riots came after weeks of deteriorating
circumstances during which the local magistrates had been slow to act. Hence,
you could see riots as being in some sense a kind of &quot;petitioning in strength
and in deed.&quot; </p>
<p>Agrarian riots were
often in a similar way a particular stage in a process of dispute and
negotiation. That might include, for example, initial appeals to people who
had set in motion enclosure schemes to desist and give them up. The appeal
might come from a local minister. It might come from sympathetic local
gentlemen. It might come from the women of the parish. It might come from the
manorial jury. If that failed, then there were a number of informal sanctions
which could be taken to try to put moral pressure upon those who were engaged
in an enclosure. So for example, in 1616 in a village called Over Compton,
which is in Dorset down in the southwest, a local enclosing landlord who was
called Andrew Abington found a paper stuck on the church door when he came to
church one Sunday. The paper read, &quot;Here be Andrew Abington&#39;s
Commandments,&quot; and it followed: &quot;Thou shalt do no right. Thou shalt catch what
thou canst. Thou shalt pay no man. Thou shalt bear false witness against thy
neighbors. Thou shalt deny thine own hand,&quot; that is deny responsibility.
And shortly afterwards, Andrew Abington&#39;s Commandments, having embarrassed him
at the church door, had been set to music and were being sung around the local
ale houses as an effort to humiliate him. </p>
<p>Or again there could
be anonymous threats. One landlord in Warwickshire in 1607 received an
anonymous letter threatening that action would be taken if he proceeded with
the enclosure, and the letter was signed &quot;Thomas Unhedgeall&quot;; Thomas
Unhedgeall. Another form of action frequently taken was to initiate lawsuits. Sometimes
tenants would get together and pool their resources in a common fund to bring a
case. At Neroche Forest in Somerset in the west country, for example, tenants
anxious to defend the woodlands &quot;put their purses together,&quot; as it was put, on
the advice of the sympathetic steward of another local gentleman, who gave them
that advice after an open meeting, and then with their common purse they hired
a lawyer to bring a case to try to prevent the enclosure. </p>
<p>When a riot came it
was often also a deliberate tactic to get the case heard in an authoritative
central court, especially the Court of Star Chamber meeting in Westminster. The
Court of Star Chamber, as one of the highest courts in the land, was staffed
with councillors who were often reasonably sympathetic to the interests of the
local tenantry and who might further their case or force arbitration in the
interests of preserving public order. A riot, which could provoke a landlord
to bring a case in Star Chamber, was an excellent way of having local
grievances heard before an authoritative forum and had the additional advantage
of getting it done at the expense of the landlord who brought the case. </p>
<p>So there&#39;s a tactical
element in many enclosure riots and that&#39;s, of course, an important reason for
their relative restraint. They were a way of calling the authorities&#39;
attention to grievances; a way of putting pressure on the authorities to act
and to remedy these discontents. And surprisingly often it worked. Magistrates
did put emergency dearth regulations into operation in the aftermath of food
riots. Punishments of food riots were usually relatively few and relatively
light. Or again Star Chamber or other central courts quite frequently ordered
the settlement of particular disputes by a process of arbitration and sometimes
indeed they even found for the tenants and forbade the planned enclosure. </p>
<p>But, if action on the
part of local people was not restrained in that way it could be a very
different story. At Maldon on the coast of Essex in 1629 for example, there
were two food riots. The first of them ended in the authorities taking action
to put scarcity regulations into effect and punishing very few people and
punishing them only lightly. When a second riot took place, the authorities
lost their patience. A special commission was sent down from Westminster which
tried those involved as ringleaders in the riots and hanged four of them,
including the leader of the Maldon riots, Ann Carter, who was known to her
followers as &#39;Captain Ann&#39;. Or again in the Midlands in 1607 the spread of
rioting against enclosure from parish to parish was eventually deemed by the
authorities to be so threatening that they defined it as treasonable rebellion.
Martial law was declared and the rising was put down with another crop of
executions, including the execution of the leader, John Reynolds, known to his
followers as &#39;Captain Pouch&#39;. He got that name because he had a leather pouch
in which he claimed to have authority from the king to oppose enclosures. When
he was taken, it was found that his pouch contained his lunch, some bread and
cheese. Interestingly, in the new<i> Oxford Dictionary of National Biography </i>you&#39;ll
find both Ann Carter and Captain Pouch included amongst the dignitaries of
national history. The--our sense of the past has broadened wide enough to
include people who previously would have had no place. </p>
<p>Well, that kind of
outcome, if things were deemed to have gone too far, could very sharply remind
the common people only too graphically of who ruled in sixteenth- and
seventeenth-century England. And that kind of flat repression of discontent
was usually a sign that the authorities had become nervous. And it raises a
further point. The usual focus in the literature upon the relative order and
the rationality and the tactical good sense of popular protest, and on the
usual moderation of response on the part of the authorities, all of this is
true. And yet it runs the risk of making it all seem a little bit too neat, a
little bit too orderly. I think we have to remember also that there was a good
deal of danger in all of this activity; sometimes quite serious danger. </p>
<p>One mustn&#39;t forget
that the participants in many of these actions were very anxious and sometimes
very angry. We mustn&#39;t forget that sometimes what began as a specific,
localized, limited, protest could escalate. The outstanding example is Kett&#39;s
Rebellion in 1549, which began as an enclosure riot and ended of course with
open rebellion and indeed a pitched battle. That was very exceptional. Nonetheless,
that possibility did exist. The point is that as a tactic of protest and as a
tactic of negotiation with rulers, riot could be a rather dangerous game of
brinkmanship. The authorities for their part had to try to contain it. They
were expected to respond. They had to retain their authority and their
credibility by responding in the right kind of way. The crowd for its part
often pushed and menaced, but it had to avoid going too far if it was not to
provoke pretty severe retaliation. Acts of insubordination had to be tricked
out with the appearance of ultimate deference to authority. The responses of
concession and conciliation which the authorities made had to retain the
appearance of gracious magnanimity on the part of rulers, concerned rulers. That
was the best way to save their face. </p>
<p>It seems to be the
case that for the most part this delicate line was held, which is, in a way, a
tribute on the one hand to the skill with which the leadership of the crowds
conducted their actions and, on the other hand, the skill with which many of
the magistrates tried to defuse what were potentially very explosive situations.
But of course that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that the protestors were sincere in
the postures of deference which they might adopt in the face of authority when
they negotiated with them, and it certainly doesn&#39;t mean that popular protest
was, as some historians have argued, essentially un-political. </p>
<p>When people describe
these actions as un-political what they seem to mean is that they involved no
challenge to the authority of the state, and that they were not indicative of
any revolutionary attempt to overthrow the established social order. Well, of
course they didn&#39;t! Even the most determined of protestors had no alternative
model of the social and political order to appeal to. There are no conceptions
of equal rights. There are no conceptions of democracy. They had to work
within the structures of power and authority in a hierarchical society as they
found them. Their objectives were necessarily limited. But that doesn&#39;t mean
that their objectives were not &#39;political&#39; in the sense that they were
attempting to exert some influence on how power was exercised, influence on how
power was exercised within their local communities. </p>
<p>These forms of
popular protest one could say, in that sense, were quintessentially political
in the sense that they advanced claims by local people to be considered; that
they advanced claims to certain rights--to eat, to enjoy the common--rights
which they were very aware of even in a social system that permitted them no
formal political voice. They could still have some say in defining the terms
of their subordinate place in society and they could achieve limited ends in
doing so. That matters a great deal. It matters a great deal because it
prevented their complete alienation from the existing social order and
encouraged them to seek justice where they felt aggrieved, rather than simply
exacting from time to time a desperate and bloody revenge--and that mattered. It
could matter a great deal in particular when the country fell into political
crisis in the 1640s. </p>
<p>And finally, one last
point: the historians who write about popular protest very often have, towards
the end of their studies, a somewhat elegiac tone. That&#39;s because in the long
run the defenders of the customary agrarian order lost. They lost because the
world that they--that they were trying to defend was gradually dissolving all
around them. By the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the
resistance of manorial communities to agrarian change was very largely over,
because such manorial communities hardly existed anymore. Communities of
tenants with a collective interest in the customs of the manor had gradually
given way to a rural society consisting of landlords, large-scale commercial
farmers, and landless agricultural laborers who possessed very few rights to
defend. </p>
<p>But, if that was the
case, the tradition of protest established in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries did not entirely die. Grain riots certainly continued. They faded
out only in the nineteenth century when greater agricultural productivity and
modern railway transportation finally ironed out and alleviated the
inequalities of supply which had once provoked those local actions. And as for
the defense of custom one could say, I think, that aspects of it were
transferred into another sphere. Custom might be in retreat in rural England,
but in the emerging world of industrial England a new world of custom was being
born. It was being born amongst the skilled journeyman workers of the urban
trades, amongst rural weavers, amongst coal miners, and seamen in the growing
merchant navy. In all of these spheres new customs, the customs of the trade,
were being established. And they involved, rather like the older agrarian
customs, certain established expectations and practices: expectations regarding
fair wages, decent working conditions, the proper relationship which should
exist between master and employee. These people, increasingly numerous in the
seventeenth century, were the products of an emergent capitalist market
economy. They were its children. They didn&#39;t oppose it as such. But they
tried to place their own limitations on the demands which it made upon them, as
best they could, defending their own place within its structures. I&#39;m speaking
of course of the emergence of the earliest forms of labor organization which
you find emerging amongst the journeymen and manufacturing workers of the
industrial districts from the late seventeenth century. The context had
changed, but the essence of the tradition could be said to have continued in
new ways for new times. The age of the manor was ending, but the age of
organized labor was just beginning.</p>
