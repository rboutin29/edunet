<p><b>Professor Keith Wrightson</b>: Okay, well today
we&#39;re just winding down. First of all, a few concluding reflections to wrap up
the course. </p>
<p>Well, we&#39;ve now
traced the development of a society, of a political culture and indeed, in many
ways, a whole national culture, over more than 200 years, 250 years. I
promised when we started off in lecture one that we&#39;d be looking at some great
personalities, some great events and some great processes, and I hope that that
promise has been met. </p>
<p>We&#39;ve had the great
personalities, warts and all, with or without heads. We&#39;ve also traced a
changing political culture: the development of the institutions of
representative government; the eventual taming of personal monarchy; the
development of concepts of the rule of law, of political participation, of
notions of liberty under the law. We&#39;ve also looked at the emergence, the
early stages of the emergence, of a fully capitalist market economy, and indeed
its connections to a nascent world economy. And we&#39;ve looked at the transition
from a late medieval society of orders to what can reasonably be described as a
nascent class society. We&#39;ve looked at a transformation in religious culture,
the eventual acceptance of a tentative pluralism and toleration in matters of
belief. And of course we&#39;ve looked at enormous changes in levels of education,
in popular literacy and the print culture that served these and so on. And
throughout all of this, in many ways, we&#39;ve looked at the hammering out of the
conflicts to which all of these processes gave rise. And eventually, the
finding of ways to deal with those conflicts peaceably. </p>
<p>Well, these are
things of some significance. They matter, most obviously, to the extent that
some of the events and processes that we&#39;ve been examining in this period have
left a legacy in the modern world in terms of institutions, in terms of values,
in terms of ideas. And that&#39;s not just true of England or Britain, but also of
a larger world that at one time or another was subject to British influence,
firsthand or at secondhand. To that extent, many of these things are a widely
shared legacy and worth knowing something about. They are, in the words of one
Tudor chronicler, in his definition of history, they&#39;re &quot;tales useful to be
known.&quot; And all that is one form of what Peter Laslett, in his famous phrase,
described as &quot;understanding ourselves in time.&quot;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>But when he used that
phrase, he also meant something larger. He meant reflecting on the actual nature
of the historical process. Now, of course one can do that for any period of
history for any country; they&#39;re all equally valuable as human experience,
though the stories and the meanings vary. We&#39;ve looked at one particular case,
but it also serves to illustrate some general points about the historical
process and I&#39;ll raise them briefly. </p>
<p>First, of course,
history is process. We&#39;re looking at societies which are in constant motion.
Change is the heart of the matter. People change, societies and their
institutions change, their values change, their identities change. An outline
course of this kind helps to reveal that, and early modern England certainly
illustrates that general truth. It was a time obviously enough of the breaking
of worlds and of the making of worlds, of the erosion of old certainties and
identities and structures, and the creation of new ones. </p>
<p>But secondly,
historical change of this kind is messy. It&#39;s complex and messy and, in many
ways, ambiguous. History is never scripted in advance. Historians who have an
ideological cast of mind might like to pretend that it is and to describe
historical processes as though they have a certain inevitability, leading to
preconceived ends of one kind or another. But they deceive themselves.
Nothing in history is pre-ordained. Some change may be the successful outcome
of deliberately planned action, but a great deal is the result of improvised
responses to immediate contingencies. And in both cases, there are always the
unforeseen consequences. The history of early modern England illustrates this
well enough. Think of the Henrician Reformation, or think of the regicide and
what followed it, or think of the long working out of the outcome of the Revolution
of 1688. </p>
<p>So it&#39;s not scripted
in advance and it&#39;s not synchronized either. Change of different kinds
proceeds at different paces. We&#39;ve looked at political change, economic
change, social change, cultural change. We&#39;ve seen the urgency with which
political change can often take place, but then there are also those processes
which are of a very gradual, very slow and cumulative nature, worked out over
generations and uneven in their long-term impact. Think of the uneven spread
of literacy, for example, or the process of economic change that I&#39;ve looked
at. As a result, at any one point in time, any society is a kind of mixture of
forms because change is uneven, because it&#39;s partial. </p>
<p>So, the process is
messy, but nonetheless, in all of this one can find patterns, one can trace
connections. If it wasn&#39;t so, one would not be able to offer interpretations
of the process of change. One wouldn&#39;t be able to offer arguments about the
nature of causation. And again, looking at a particular society over a long
period of time helps one to appreciate this aspect of the study of history. It
reveals the interconnections. It reveals the way things work their way through
over time. But no single interpretation ever encompasses it all, of course.
No single interpretation ever holds all the answers. How can one simply answer
a question like, &quot;When did England become Protestant?&quot; And what did that mean,
anyway? That&#39;s why, of course, we constantly need to revise our views of it
all in the light of new evidence, in the light of new imaginative insights on
the part of historians. </p>
<p>We can never wholly
recover the past; it&#39;s gone, it&#39;s drowned in time. But we can enter a dialog
with the evidence that it has left and, by doing that, remake the past again
and again in the present, according to our changing preoccupations and our
changing understandings. Finding new dimensions of what was going on,
previously neglected; finding new meanings, new understandings. And this is
very evident in the ongoing debates over all the major issues of this particular
period, and the way that new issues are constantly emerging. </p>
<p>Well, it&#39;s because of
that complexity that I&#39;ve tried to present an account of change in this period
that is complex and many faceted, that includes many dimensions; the political,
the economic, the social, the cultural, each of them making its own
contribution to an overall process, each of them helping to make the overall
process comprehensible. And it&#39;s because of the ambiguities in all of this
that I&#39;ve tried to adopt a variety of perspectives; looking at things from the
Catholic point of view and from the Protestant point of view, from the
monarchical, from the populist; history as viewed from the top, or from the
bottom, or from the middle; history wearing breeches, history dressed in a
gown. And there&#39;s a point to all of this; the point is simply that history
contains many stories, all of which deserve to be told. It contains, in the
evidence it leaves to us, many voices, all of which deserve to be heard. No one
owns the past; it&#39;s common land. There&#39;s no velvet rope denying access. It&#39;s
not a gated community. The dead, in the evidence they leave to us, will talk
to anyone. They&#39;re very nice that way. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve also tried
repeatedly to give a sense of the context within which people lived, made their
decisions and choices, and acted. And again, there&#39;s a very simple historical
philosophy behind that which is neatly stated in the old adage that people make
their own history, but they don&#39;t make it just as they choose. They make it within
contexts and under conditions that are not of their own choosing; some of which
are inherited, some of which are newly encountered, some of which can be
anticipated, some of which take them by surprise. But by their actions and
responses and choices, they can change their world, though always within
certain constraints. And to understand that process and the outcomes, we need
to understand the context within which people acted in their own time, in their
own ways, according to their own lights. </p>
<p>One of the most
important of such contexts is of course the structures of power in any society,
in determining action, in initiating change. Some people carried more weight,
some had more clout; we&#39;ve seen examples enough of that in early modern England
in the political sphere, in the economic sphere and elsewhere. But we&#39;ve seen
examples too of the fact that power can be resisted, it can be confronted, it
can even be put under restraint. People make their own history, they can alter
the contexts, sometimes quite significantly, reshaping the world that is
encountered by the next generation, and that in a sense has been the core of
the narrative element of this course. So to conclude: things change, change is
messy, it&#39;s ambiguous in its meaning, there are many interconnected stories,
history has many voices, people make their own history, but not just as they
please, and if some have more power than others to call the shots, they don&#39;t
have to have it all their own way; nor did they. </p>
<p>Reflecting on the process
as a whole gives the history of any period and any country its meaning, its
many meanings, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s worth bothering. In studying history, we
constantly reconstruct the past in the present, disciplined as we do it by
respect for the evidence which it leaves to us, but drawn in to examine and to
re-examine that evidence by the problems which we ourselves feel the need to
understand. Each of us is drawn, almost instinctively, to those aspects of the
past which continue to resonate to us individually across the centuries because
they speak to us for reasons we sometimes might not fully understand. They
speak to our preoccupations, they speak to our dilemmas. And in trying to
understand them, we can not only understand ourselves better in time, but also
see possibilities for the future. </p>
<p>Historical events can
often be dismaying, but historical study is ultimately encouraging; it&#39;s
concerned with change, with possibility, with adaptation, with finding ways.
It&#39;s concerned with human experience and achievement of every kind. Sustaining
a sense of that ancestry is important in what sometimes seems an increasingly
frivolous and de-historicized Western culture with an extremely shallow
awareness of its own past that can result in a kind of disorientation.
History, in contrast, tries to understand; to understand what we have been, to
raise questions and suggestions and implications for what we might be capable
of becoming. And that&#39;s why history, all history, matters. It really does
matter. </p>
<p>Okay, well that&#39;s my
little sermon, and now we&#39;re going to have a short awards ceremony, for which I
must prepare myself. [Laughter]</p>
<p>Right. [Laughter]
I hereby declare myself Supreme Head of the History Department. Henceforward
only my interpretations will be taught, and henceforward, all books published
by members of the Department will contain a groveling dedication to me.
[Laughter] But even the most horrid tyrant cannot rule alone.
You need an aristocracy. [Laughter] And aristocracies, as you
know, need to be rewarded. And so we have an awards ceremony to reward our
teaching fellows; the russet-coated captains of this course who (laughs) know
what they teach and love what they know. Okay, now I have some nominations for
these awards here prepared for me by Thomas Cromwell.</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>Right. Now, first of
all, what do we have here? Yes, okay. We have the Henry VIII Award for
Devotion to Family Values and for being top redhead. [Lucy Kaufman] [Applause]</p>
<p><b>Student: </b>[Laughs]<b>
</b>Oh, thank you [laughs]. It&#39;s a divorced, beheaded, died,
divorced, beheaded, survived bag, which I will use for my library books for my
work.</p>
<p><b>Keith Wrightson</b>: Okay. And now we
have the Elizabeth I Award for Not Making Windows into Students&#39; Souls and for
Keeping Advisors in their Place. [Courtney Thomas] [Laughter and
applause]<b>. </b></p>
<p>And looking ahead to
the Stuart Succession which I&#39;ve done my best to avoid, but unfortunately it&#39;s
going to happen, so my soothsayers tell me, we have the King Charles II Award --
the last real king -- the King Charles II Award for Being Tall, Dark and Partly
French -- [laughter]<b> </b>-- and for staying cool and carrying
on. To Justin DuRivage. [Applause]<b> </b></p>
<p>Okay. So that&#39;s it.
[Laughter] Do remember to let me know if you intend to come to
the Center for British Art tomorrow morning for the last visit there and now
we&#39;ll turn to housekeeping matters and I&#39;ll tell you a little bit about the nature
of the exam.</p>
