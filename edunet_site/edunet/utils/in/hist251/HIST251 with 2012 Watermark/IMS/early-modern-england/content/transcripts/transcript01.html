<p><b>Professor Keith
Wrightson: </b>Right.
So this is History 251, and this morning I want simply to introduce the class
and to explain what it might offer to you. </p>
<p>First of all, it&#39;s
obviously an outline course. It deals with a large period of history, 200-250
years, covering what I describe in the title as &#39;Early Modern England&#39;. Well,
that&#39;s a label that may or may not mean very much to you. I could have called
the course &#39;Tudor and Stuart England&#39; and indeed that term is used in the
subtitle. It is about England in the reigns of the Tudor and Stuart monarchs
running roughly from the 1480s to the 1710s. But to call it that might suggest
that the course is structured around the rulers and that like so much history
the focus is very much on the top. Well, in part it certainly is. In
introducing the political narrative, which will form part of the core of the
course, I&#39;ll certainly be looking at the lives and the times of the great
figures who gave their names to the age, the faces on the coins you might say.
The notorious Henry VIII and his six unfortunate wives who are always difficult
to remember in the right order--and Lucy, you have a helpful phrase for this, yeah?</p>
<p><b>Student: </b>Divorced, beheaded,
died, divorced, beheaded, survived.</p>
<p><b>Professor Keith
Wrightson: </b>Okay.
Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived--the lucky one. Henry VIII.
The stunning and rather perplexing Queen Elizabeth I--Gloriana, Good Queen Bess,
the Virgin Queen. Whether you imagine her as Cate Blanchett or as Judi Dench [laughter]
she still has the glamour, a woman who announced to her people early in her
reign that she would &quot;not make windows into men&#39;s souls.&quot; She would &quot;not make
windows into men&#39;s souls.&quot; And she&#39;s continued to resist the efforts of most
historians to try to make windows into hers. And then there&#39;s the four Stuart
kings. James I described at the time as &quot;the Wisest Fool in Christendom,&quot; a
man who after an adventurous youth as King of Scotland became King of England
and it was said treated every day thereafter as if it were Christmas day. Charles
I, his son, whose policies precipitated Civil War in the mid-seventeenth
century and who was eventually put on trial and executed by his own people in
1649. His son, Charles II, restored to the throne after ten years of
republican government, Charles known as the Merry Monarch, the man who was
energetic principally in his pleasures, famous for having innumerable
mistresses and fourteen illegitimate children, never--though no legitimate
children at all--never happier than when swanning around St. James Park with
one of his mistresses and his spaniels. The--you know the King Charles spaniel--a
nice, little black and white spaniel? Yeah, named after him of course. And the
King looked rather like a King Charles spaniel [laughter], you
know when he had his wig on--the nice, curly ears as it were and he had nice
brown eyes too. [Laughter]. And then his brother, James II,
former Duke of York, came to the throne and after three years was driven from
it in the second English revolution of the seventeenth century, driven in to
exile, later known as the King Over the Water by those who remained loyal to
him. Well, it&#39;s been said that two of the Stuart kings were politically astute
but morally defective and two were virtuous men whose political ineptitude cost
them the throne. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, we could say of this remarkable
dynasty that to lose the throne once could be considered a misfortune but to
lose it twice suggests a certain amount of political ineptitude. </p>
<p>Well, you will hear
and read about all of these people and the many others who shaped England&#39;s
public destiny and political destiny in this period, and others too--and today
is September 3rd, which reminds me of Oliver Cromwell. He was born and died on
September 3rd and also fought his two greatest battles on September 3rd, which
is probably no coincidence. It was his lucky day. The great puritan general,
the Lord Protector of the English republic between 1653 and 1658, a man
described as a man of &#39;agonies and exultations,&#39; a quite extraordinary figure.
An idealist in some ways, ahead of his time on religious toleration for
example, in other ways tainted by the bigotry of his age, and historically
perhaps more loved and more hated than almost any other figure in British
history. </p>
<p>So there are the
great ones, but there&#39;s also much more to it than can be approached by focusing
on such figures alone. And if about a third of the lecture course is devoted
to the political narratives and the--and understanding how they unfolded--the
rest is devoted to other aspects of the period, to its religious history, to
its social history, aspects of its economy, aspects of the culture of the time.
These are matters which might sometimes have been vitally influenced by the
decisions of rulers, but they also developed in their own independent ways and
they obviously involved a far larger cast of characters. So this course is
very much about the common people too and their experience of the age as well
as about those who ruled them. So like one of the great Hollywood epics we
have a cast of millions. That&#39;s why I&#39;m using the more capacious, if vaguer,
label &quot;Early Modern England,&quot; by which I mean simply the broad period
between the end of the fifteenth and the middle of the eighteenth century which
saw the laying down of what were to become the essential characteristics of
modern Britain in government, in religion, in economy, in social structure, in
culture, in political values. </p>
<p>So I&#39;m inviting you,
then, to take a journey of the imagination through two and a half centuries. But
you might say that was an awfully long time ago. This is the kind of history
that&#39;s long dead, that&#39;s drowned in time. Why should you concern yourselves
with the distant past, so remote from your own contemporary experience? Why
bother with England or Britain? Why does it matter? Well, I&#39;d say there are
at least three good reasons for exploring deep history and in a way that takes
us way beyond the immediacy of a more familiar historical world. First of all,
because to do so is imaginatively enriching--it involves rediscovering a lost
world and that takes imagination. Secondly, because it&#39;s also intellectually
demanding. All history, of course, involves us in a fairly rigorous
intellectual discipline. We have to develop arguments about causation, about
why things happened the way they did, and we do that by establishing a dialog
between the questions that we want to ask and the evidence which the past has
left to us. Well, my point is simply that that can be a peculiarly enthralling
exercise for periods of the distant past for which the evidence is often
ambiguous or difficult or partial, in which it&#39;s produced by unfamiliar
institutions, in which people are thinking with unfamiliar casts of mind, and
we have to try to think ourselves into those minds to understand what was
happening in their own terms, informing our causal arguments. That can stretch
you imaginatively and intellectually. And thirdly, and perhaps most
importantly, because it creates meaning. It helps us to understand ourselves
in time in a deeper way by exposing twenty-first century attitudes and values
and experiences to a much deeper comparative context. Looking at the distant
past can alert us to the sheer otherness of the past, to the reality of deep
and fundamental change in the course of four or five centuries and to the
provisional and contingent and temporary nature of so much that we take for
granted today, as well as the family resemblances which can still be found. That&#39;s
an exercise which can be enormously provocative and stimulating, a challenge
that helps us understand better our own place in time. </p>
<p>Right. Well, the
story of early modern England has got a good deal to offer in all of these
respects. It can certainly capture the imagination. This was a time of great
events: the Reformation, the civil wars of the seventeenth century, the
foundations of the first British empire. It was a time of great personalities:
the rulers that I&#39;ve already mentioned, but also it was the age of Shakespeare,
of Milton, the time of the diarist Samuel Pepys, the proto-democrat John
Lilburne, the early feminist writer Mary Astell, and so one could go on. It
was a time of great processes as well as events: longer-term processes, great
changes in the structures of society, in economic development, in political
culture, in the growth of literacy and print culture. And it&#39;s also the period
when, almost for the first time in British history, we have the evidence
surviving that enables us to get to grips with the mass of the population and
to explore the everyday dynamics of their lives, their relationships, their
emotional palettes you might say. </p>
<p>It&#39;s only from about
the early sixteenth century that the sources survive in large quantities that
enable imaginative historians to approach questions like how long do people
live? How subject were they to early death from diseases like the plague? What
age did they get married? Who chose their marriage partners? What was the
quality of their family relationships? How many people could read and what did
they read if they could read? How did people make their livings and how did the
economy change? What were the levels of crime and violence and how well were
they controlled?-- and a host of other questions which are not previously
accessible because we don&#39;t have adequate sources. So one can begin to get a
sense of the rest of the population, and to give you just one particular
example, around about 1900 a box of papers were found in the cellars of
Worcester College, Oxford, and they turned out to be the papers of the
secretary of the council of Oliver Cromwell&#39;s army, and they included a verbatim
shorthand account of debates which had taken place in 1647 at the end of the
Civil War when the council of the army debated the settlement of the kingdom in
the aftermath of the war. </p>
<p>One of the
extraordinary things about this verbatim account is that you hear the voices of
the common soldiers. One of them who is representing a cavalry regiment keeps
interrupting the debate. He keeps saying, &quot;What has the soldier fought
for all this time?&quot; He uses the phrase again and again: &quot;What has the
soldier fought for?&quot; And it&#39;s thrilling because you hear for the first
time the voice of the common people erupting into the councils of the nation.
Well, that symbolizes in a sense what the available documents enable people to
do from the sixteenth century onwards. </p>
<p>Secondly, looking at
early modern England can engage the intellect. The historical literature is
exceptionally rich. It&#39;s very large, created by generations of historians from
all over the English-speaking world, and quite a few of them or significant of
them were Yale scholars. This literature has produced many of the classic
works of historical writing in the English language and it&#39;s also proved to be
restless and innovative and rather argumentative. All of the recent movements
in historical research and writing are represented amongst its practitioners; mainstream
political and constitutional history, gender history, the &#39;new social history,&#39;
the &#39;new cultural history&#39; influenced by critical theory, what people now
describe as the &#39;new political history&#39; which tries to reintegrate social and
political development. All of this is represented and much more. Since the
1960s in particular it&#39;s been one of the most vigorous of historical
traditions. There&#39;s plenty there to engage the intellect, whatever it is that
you happen to be most interested in. </p>
<p>And thirdly, it helps
to understand ourselves in time. Of course, all periods of history do that,
but the events of the early modern period have a peculiar resonance. The
events and processes of these centuries are of more than merely historical
interest. If you&#39;re concerned with the institutions of representative
government and how they came into being for the first time; if you&#39;re concerned
with the notion of the rule of law; if you&#39;re concerned with the structures and
dynamics of a capitalist market economy; if you&#39;re interested in concepts of
individual liberty and collective responsibility, or with the excesses of
religious fanaticism, or with innumerable social and cultural attitudes which continue
to echo in our own relationships and in our own time, if we only know how to
recognize them, and if you&#39;re concerned with the language itself, then early
modern England has got a great deal to say to you. It&#39;s because these issues
are so alive in the literature of the period that the literature is so rich,
and it&#39;s for that reason also that it&#39;s very much an international literature. </p>
<p>These issues concern
scholars from all over the world and there&#39;s a further dimension to that too,
which is that a great deal of what happened in sixteenth- and
seventeenth-century England later impacted upon a much wider world. The
history of early modern England is, by extension, very much a part not only of
British history but also of American and Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand
history. It&#39;s got things to say about the history of India and of Africa. Some
of the things that happened in this period left their fingerprints all over the
world in all kinds of ways. They--it certainly left its fingerprints on New
Haven to come close to home. If you look around the town and you look at the
churches: Episcopal, Presbyterian, Congregational, Baptists, Quakers, all of
these religious traditions have their origins in sixteenth- and
seventeenth-century England. Or if you look at the street names. Running out
of Broadway we have Goffe, Whalley, and Dixwell streets, all three of them
named after three of the men who signed the death warrant of King Charles I in
1649 and later hid out in New Haven, which was a radically puritan colony which
gave them asylum after the return of the king. Our suburb of Hamden is named
after John Hampden who, in 1637, stood up against the policies of King Charles I
and tried to fight him in a landmark legal case. And if you start turning to
other place names in Connecticut it just gets ridiculous. We have New London,
okay, as old London. We have Norwich, or &#39;Norrich&#39; as it&#39;s pronounced in
England, it&#39;s up there. New Haven itself is down here. We have Litchfield,
that&#39;s over there. And we have Durham--is up there. And we have Stamford,
which is there, yeah. We have Greenwich, which is over here. Same place names,
they&#39;re just in a different configuration and, in a sense, that&#39;s symbolic of
the relationship between British and early modern--early American history: same
names, different configuration, slightly different meanings. So in a sense a
good deal of this is American history by extension and of consequence to
everyone who&#39;s become involved in America&#39;s story over the last two and half
centuries. To explore it is to explore part of your own identity. </p>
<p>Right. Well, this
course is intended to provide an introduction to all of this. It&#39;s up to date. It&#39;s
also intended to be very inclusive in its range and contents. We&#39;ll run through
from the late fifteenth century to the early eighteenth century. We&#39;ll look at
the momentous changes and innovations which took place. In 1500, England was
very much a personal monarchy. The king really ruled. By 1700, it&#39;s a
constitutional monarchy in which the center of political life was a permanently
sitting elected parliament and it&#39;s become not simply the Kingdom of England
but the United Kingdom of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. In 1500,
England was part of Catholic Christendom, practicing a very lively and vital
form of late medieval Catholicism. By 1700, the country was aggressively
Protestant with an established Church of England which could no longer contain
all the varieties of Protestant denominations which had emerged, leading to the
granting finally of religious toleration in the late seventeenth century. In 1500,
it was largely a localized economy of peasant families and urban craftsmen. By
1700, it was a highly commercialized market economy, capitalistic in structure
and engaged in trade with a much larger world, especially with the East and
with the Atlantic. In 1500, it&#39;s a world of rural communities and small towns
with only one significant city, London. By 1700, it was the most rapidly
urbanizing country in Europe, London had become the biggest city in Europe and
a kind of prototype metropolis. In 1700, London was regarded as a kind of a
shock city the way people thought about New York in the mid-twentieth century. In
1500, most people were illiterate. By 1700, literacy was widespread. There
was a vigorous print culture including the first English language newspapers.
And so one could go on and on, pointing the contrast between the beginning and
the end of the period. </p>
<p>The story of these
and other massive transformations used to be told as a kind of a triumphalist
story, an unfolding of British destiny, what people refer to as &#39;the Whig
interpretation of history&#39;, a very nationalistic take on the history of this
period. It traced the growth from the sixteenth century of political liberty,
religious freedom, economic opulence, and world power as a kind of steady
upward ascent. Sometimes it had to be hard fought against the forces of
tyranny or superstition or backwardness, but in a sense it was portrayed as
being almost preordained, a kind of English version of manifest destiny. Well,
since the 1950s, the perspective has changed massively. Britain&#39;s place in the
world has changed. People think about its history differently. New forms of
history have been pioneered. Other voices are now heard, especially the voices
of the losers in these processes, all the people who only had a subordinate
place in these achievements. As a result, we&#39;ve now got a less one-sided and,
in many ways, a more mature historiography. We&#39;ve got over the old tendency to
strut and swagger about Britain&#39;s historical role. The changes of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries now seem very far from preordained and, as
I say, the less one-sided perspective reveals the losses as well as the gains,
the failures and the crimes as well as the achievements. The point is it&#39;s all
part of the story and it&#39;s all available to be studied. </p>
<p>Well, let&#39;s look
briefly at the syllabus. It&#39;s roughly chronological. There&#39;s a timeline
running through the whole thing, but as it develops there are overlaps. I
planned it as a kind of building up of layers of knowledge, each one acting as
a kind of stepping stone to the next. In the earliest lectures, lectures two
to six, I&#39;ll concentrate on trying to establish some of the contexts of
society, economy and government as they were in the early sixteenth century. I&#39;ll
be looking at the household, at local communities, at people&#39;s social and
economic roles and relationships, at the structures of power and authority as
they were at the time of kings Henry VII and Henry VIII, roughly between the
1480s and the 1540s. That&#39;s to establish the context because, as has been
said, the discipline of history is essentially a discipline of context. Facts
acquire their meaning only when one understands the context which helps us to
grasp their meaning. So we&#39;ll set up the context. Then from lecture seven we
move into the tracing of change. Lectures seven and eight will look at the
impact of the Reformation and the opening up of religious divisions between the
1530s and the 1550s. In lecture nine, we&#39;ll pause to look at some of the
problems which were produced by the massive population growth which began in
the sixteenth century and the economic stirring which that produced. </p>
<p>In lectures ten and eleven,
I&#39;ll look at the England of Elizabeth I, focusing on the problems in religion
and in government policy faced by the Queen, the struggle for stability in the
immensely insecure environment which she inherited, and then in lectures twelve
and thirteen I&#39;ll go on to look at some of the principal features of social
change under Elizabeth and the early Stuarts, looking at roughly the 1580s
through to the 1630s, a period of major transition in society and economy. Lectures
fourteen through seventeen will look at various aspects of social and cultural
change in the same period, the late Elizabethan, early Stuart period. I&#39;ll
look at the witch craze of that time. I&#39;ll look at crime and disorder, at
popular protest and rebellion and at literacy and education. Then lectures eighteen
to nineteen, we&#39;ll come to the religious and political tensions of the early
seventeenth century which eventually exploded in 1642 into the civil wars--which
I&#39;ll look at in lectures twenty and twenty-one--and the establishment after the
execution of King Charles the First of the English Republic which lasted until
1660. Lecture twenty-two will look at the restored monarchy after 1660,
tracing it up to the revolution of 1688. Lecture twenty-three will look at the
rapid economic development of the late seventeenth century which provided the
resources to back the matter I&#39;ll treat in lecture twenty-four, which was the
creation of a new state structure and the emergence of Britain as a significant
world power. </p>
<p>So that&#39;s the rough
timeline. Those are the issues which will be covered. Obviously, the course
has an essentially narrative structure but it&#39;s also very much an analytical
narrative. It&#39;s about trying to understand how all of these changes intersected
with each other, how they influenced each other over time. And I suppose
that&#39;s what really interests me, trying to grasp the wholeness of the process
of historical change, how it all fits together, and that&#39;s the best reason for
doing an outline course of this kind. It enables you to see these developments
in the round; all the different aspects; how they intersect.</p>
<p>Now the readings
which are suggested on the syllabus will help you hopefully to do all of that. They&#39;ve
been chosen quite carefully. The three textbooks are available from the Yale
bookstore. The course packet of additional selections from various books and
articles is available from Docuprint down on Whitney, the address is given on
the syllabus and the phone number, and all of these works are also on reserve
in the library, in Sterling. The reading runs at about 100 to 150 pages a
week. </p>
<p>Now some of the
readings you&#39;ll find are quite demanding, but I make no apologies for that. You
can say it&#39;s a mark of respect for the capabilities of the students that I&#39;m
setting some pretty challenging stuff at times. But if you follow the readings
as we go through you should build up a coherent grasp of the whole period in
its different aspects and be introduced to the work of some of the best historians
currently writing about it. In a sense it&#39;s a course in good, lucid, robust
historical prose. The readings and the lectures together will provide the
basis for the section discussions which will tend to develop and add to the
lecture themes rather than simply repeating to them--repeating them--and two of
the sections will be visits to the British Art Center to look at some of the
visual evidence there. Those visits have to be on a Friday morning and they
are optional; they&#39;re not part of the examinable nature of the course but
they&#39;re there if you&#39;re interested and would like to go along. </p>
<p>Okay. Within the
sense of the whole period, which I hope you&#39;ll develop, you&#39;ll be asked to do
two pieces of more detailed work, a shorter paper of about five pages and a
longer one of about ten pages, the first due in week seven, the second due in
week fourteen. This should give you an opportunity to develop personal
interests. You can have a completely free choice of topic. You can write your
papers about any aspect of the period that you find interesting and you want to
pursue more deeply. I&#39;ll give out, in a couple of weeks&#39; time, a list of
topics that might interest you, but feel free to bring forward suggestions of
your own that you&#39;d like to investigate, or things you might pick up from
lectures that you want to take further and so forth. I&#39;ll also issue a longer
bibliography which will help to prepare for those papers and which will also
include material. If you&#39;d like to look at the history of Scotland or Ireland
or Wales, then there&#39;ll be material there on their developments also. All you
need to do about the papers is to consult with me or with the teaching fellows
to get advice on the best reading for researching the papers and subject to
that you have a free hand, whether that&#39;s some of the classical issues of the
period or whether it&#39;s other things that you simply have to--happen to have an
interest in. Last year someone was interested in public health and ended up
doing work on the plague and early public health measures, for example. We had
a person also who was interested in pregnancy and childbirth. Well, you can do
that. There&#39;s a literature on it and so forth, whatever it happens to be. The
overall assessment will be 15% for participation and discussion, 20% for the
short paper, 40% for the long paper, and 25% for the final exam, which will be
an exam in which you&#39;ll be required to write two essays from quite a large
choice of about twenty topics covering the whole range. </p>
<p>Okay. Finally, let
me introduce the teaching fellows. We have Courtney Thomas and Lucy Kaufman
and Justin DuRivage. All of us will be available to assist you in section
discussions of course. We&#39;ve scheduled seven sections with quite a wide spread
of times which hopefully will cater for everyone who&#39;s interested, and we will
be available, of course, in office hours. The teaching fellows will explain
their office hours when sections begin in third week. I&#39;ll be available
usually on Tuesdays between five and seven and on Thursdays between two and four
- p.m. in both cases. Right, other times by appointment and of course we&#39;re
all available by e-mail when necessary. Throughout, the basic teaching
philosophy for this course is quite simple. First of all, history should be
challenging but it can also be fun and, secondly, if students are going to do
well they deserve attention; so if you want it you can have it. </p>
<p>Okay. So this is a
terrific period to study. It has a terrific literature to work on. Yale has a
long and distinguished tradition in this field and fabulous resources for
studying it in the libraries, in the British Art Center, in the special
collections. My objective is simply to encourage you to engage with this field
and to use these resources and to do well, to achieve your potential and to
enjoy it. I&#39;ve been teaching and researching and writing about this period for
about forty years. Courtney and Lucy and Justin have been at it less long but
they know their stuff. We have three teaching fellows who really know their
stuff. They have their own special interests but they&#39;re very familiar with
the whole picture. We are in a position to guide you and help you get the most
out of this course, and no doubt in engaging in discussion with you and in discussing
your paper topics and so forth we will also learn from you. People new to the
subject always see things that one&#39;s missed no matter how long one&#39;s been
working on it. So we&#39;ll be happy to do all of that. So if the course attracts
you, take it and use it and use us to develop your knowledge and your skills. That&#39;s
what we&#39;re here for, and if anyone wants to ask any particular questions just
come on up at the end. Okay? </p>
