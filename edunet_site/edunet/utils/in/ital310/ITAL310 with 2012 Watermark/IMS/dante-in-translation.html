<h3>About the Course</h3>
<p>The course is an introduction to Dante and his cultural milieu through a critical reading of the <i>Divine Comedy</i> and selected minor works (<i>Vita nuova</i>, <i>Convivio</i>, <i>De vulgari eloquentia</i>, <i>Epistle to Cangrande</i>).  An analysis of Dante's autobiography, the <i>Vita nuova</i>, establishes the poetic and political circumstances of the <i>Comedy</i>'s composition.  Readings of <i>Inferno</i>, <i>Purgatory</i> and <i>Paradise</i> seek to situate Dante's work within the intellectual and social context of the late Middle Ages, with special attention paid to political, philosophical and theological concerns.  Topics in the <i>Divine Comedy</i> explored over the course of the semester include the relationship between ethics and aesthetics; love and knowledge; and exile and history. <a href="/italian-language-and-literature/dante-in-translation/content/class-sessions"> view class sessions &gt;&gt;</a></p>
