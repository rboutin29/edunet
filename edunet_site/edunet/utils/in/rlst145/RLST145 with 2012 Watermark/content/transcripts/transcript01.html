<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> You don't need me to tell you that
human civilization is very, very old. Nevertheless, our knowledge of
the earliest stages of human civilization was quite limited for many
centuries. That is, until the great archaeological discoveries of the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which unearthed for us the great
civilizations of the Ancient Near East, of which I have drawn a
remarkably life-like map here on the board: [laughter] Mediterranean, I
always start with the Mediterranean Ocean, the Nile River, the Tigris
and the Euphrates. So: the great civilizations of ancient Egypt,
Mesopotamia and the area we refer to as the Fertile Crescent, of which
a little part here about the size of Rhode Island is Canaan. And
archaeologists in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were stunned
to find the ruins and the records of remarkable peoples and
cultures--massive, complex empires in some cases but some of which had
completely disappeared from human memory. Their newly uncovered
languages had been long forgotten; their rich literary and legal texts
were now indecipherable. That soon changed. But because of those
discoveries, we are now in a position to appreciate the monumental
achievements of these early civilizations, these <i>earliest</i>
civilizations.</p>

<p>And so many scholars, and many people, have remarked that it's not a
small irony that the Ancient Near Eastern people with one of the, or
perhaps <i>the</i> most lasting legacy, was not a people that built and
inhabited one of the great centers of Ancient Near Eastern
civilization. It can be argued that the Ancient Near Eastern people
with the most lasting legacy is a people that had an idea. It was a new
idea that broke with the ideas of its neighbors, and those people were
the Israelites. And scholars have come to the realization that despite
the Bible's pretensions to the contrary, the Israelites were a small,
and I've actually overrepresented it here, I'm sure it should be much
smaller, a small and relatively insignificant group for much of their
history. They did manage to establish a kingdom in the land that was
known in antiquity as Canaan around the year 1000. They probably
succeeded in subduing some of their neighbors, collecting
tribute--there's some controversy about that--but in about 922 [BCE]
this kingdom divided into two smaller and lesser kingdoms that fell in
importance. The northern kingdom, which consisted of ten of the twelve
Israelite tribes, and known confusingly as Israel, was destroyed in 722
[BCE] by the Assyrians. The southern kingdom, which consisted of two of
the twelve tribes and known as Judah, managed to survive until the year
586 [BCE] when the Babylonians came in and conquered and sent the
people into exile. The capital, Jerusalem, fell.</p>

<p>Conquest and exile were events that normally would spell the end of
a particular ethnic national group, particularly in antiquity.
Conquered peoples would trade their defeated god for the victorious god
of their conquerors and eventually there would be a cultural and
religious assimilation, intermarriage<i>. That</i> people would
disappear as a distinctive entity, and in effect, that is what happened
to the ten tribes of the northern kingdom to a large degree. They were
lost to history. This did not happen to those members of the nation of
Israel who lived in the southern kingdom, Judah. Despite the demise of
their national political base in 586 [BCE], the Israelites alone,
really, among the many peoples who have figured in Ancient Near Eastern
history--the Sumerians, the Akkadians, the Babylonians, the Hittites,
the Phoenicians, the Hurrians, the Canaanites--they emerged after the
death of their state, producing a community and a culture that can be
traced through various twists and turns and vicissitudes of history
right down into the modern period. That's a pretty unique claim. And
they carried with them the idea and the traditions that laid the
foundation for the major religions of the western world: Judaism,
Christianity and Islam.</p>

<p>So what is this radical new idea that shaped a culture and enabled
its survival into later antiquity and really right into the present day
in some form? Well, the conception of the universe that was widespread
among ancient peoples is one that you're probably familiar with. People
regarded the various natural forces as imbued with divine power, as in
some sense divinities themselves. The earth was a divinity, the sky was
a divinity, the water was a divinity, had divine power. In other words,
the gods were identical with or imminent in the forces of nature. There
were many gods. No one single god was therefore all powerful. There is
very, very good evidence to suggest that ancient Israelites by and
large shared this world view. They participated at the very earliest
stages in the wider religious and cultic culture of the Ancient Near
East. However, over the course of time, some ancient Israelites, not
all at once and not unanimously, broke with this view and articulated a
different view, that there was one divine power, one god. But much more
important than number was the fact that this god was outside of and
above nature. This god was not identified with nature. He transcended
nature, and he wasn't known through nature or natural phenomena. He was
known through history, events and a particular relationship with
humankind. And that idea, which seems simple at first and not so very
revolutionary--we will see, that's an idea that affected every aspect
of Israelite culture and in ways that will become clear as we move
through the course and learn more about biblical religion and biblical
views of history, it was an idea that ensured the survival of the
ancient Israelites as an entity, as an ethnic religious entity. In
various complicated ways, the view of an utterly transcendent god with
absolute control over history made it possible for some Israelites to
interpret even the most tragic and catastrophic events, such as the
destruction of their capital and the exile of their remaining peoples,
not as a defeat of Israel's god or even God's rejection of them, but as
necessary, a necessary part of God's larger purpose or plan for
Israel.</p>

<p>These Israelites left for us the record of their religious and
cultural revolution in the writings that are known as the Hebrew Bible
collectively, and this course is an introduction to the Hebrew Bible as
an expression of the religious life and thought of ancient Israel and
as a foundational document of western civilization. The course has
several goals. First and foremost, we want to familiarize you with the
contents of the Hebrew Bible. We're not going to read every bit of it
word for word. We will read certain chunks of it quite carefully and
from others we will choose selections, but you will get a very good
sense and a good sampling of the contents of the Bible. A second goal
is to introduce you to a number of approaches to the study of the
Bible, different methodological approaches that have been advanced by
modern scholars but some of which are in fact quite old. At times, we
will play the historian, at times we will be literary critics. "How
does this work as literature?" At times we will be religious and
cultural critics. "What is it the Israelites were saying in their day
and in their time and against whom and for what?" A third goal of the
course is to provide some insight into the history of interpretation.
This is a really fun part of the course. The Bible's radically new
conception of the divine, its revolutionary depiction of the human
being as a moral agent, its riveting saga of the nation of Israel,
their story, has drawn generations of readers to ponder its meaning and
message. And as a result, the Bible has become the base of an enormous
edifice of interpretation and commentary and debate, both in
traditional settings but also in academic, university, secular
settings. And from time to time, particularly in section discussion,
you will have occasion to consider the ways in which certain biblical
passages have been interpreted--sometimes in very contradictory
ways--over the centuries. That can be a really fun and exciting part of
the course.</p>

<p>A fourth goal of the course is to familiarize you with the culture
of ancient Israel as represented in the Bible against the backdrop of
its Ancient Near Eastern setting, its historical and cultural setting,
because the archaeological discoveries that were referred to [above] in
the Ancient Near East, reveal to us the spiritual and cultural heritage
of all of the inhabitants of the region, including the Israelites. And
one of the major consequences of these finds is the light that they
have shed on the background and the origin of the materials in the
Bible. So we now see that the traditions in the Bible did not come out
of a vacuum. The early chapters of Genesis, Genesis 1 through
11--they're known as the "Primeval History," which is a very
unfortunate name, because these chapters really are not best read or
understood as history in the conventional sense--but these 11 chapters
owe a great deal to Ancient Near Eastern mythology. The creation story
in Genesis 1 draws upon the Babylonian epic known as Enuma Elish. We'll
be talking about that text in some depth. The story of the first human
pair in the Garden of Eden, which is in Genesis 2 and 3 has clear
affinities with the Epic of Gilgamesh, that's a Babylonian and Assyrian
epic in which a hero embarks on this exhausting search for immortality.
The story of Noah and the flood, which occurs in Genesis 6 through 9 is
simply an Israelite version of an older flood story that we have found
copies of: a Mesopotamian story called the Epic of Atrahasis [and] a
flood story that we also have incorporated in the Epic of Gilgamesh.
Biblical traditions have roots that stretch deep into earlier times and
out into surrounding lands and traditions, and the parallels between
the biblical stories and Ancient Near Eastern stories that they
parallel has been the subject of intense study.</p>

<p>However, it isn't just the similarity between the biblical materials
and the Ancient Near Eastern sources that is important to us. In fact,
in some ways it's the dissimilarity that is remarkably important to us,
the biblical transformation of a common Near Eastern heritage in light
of its radically new conceptions of God and the world and humankind.
We'll be dealing with this in some depth, but I'll give you one quick
example. We have a Sumerian story about the third millennium BCE, going
back 3000--third millennium, 3000 BCE. It's the story of Ziusudra, and
it's very similar to the Genesis flood story of Noah. In both of these
stories, the Sumerian and the Israelite story, you have a flood that is
the result of a deliberate divine decision; one individual is chosen to
be rescued; that individual is given very specific instructions on
building a boat; he is given instructions about who to bring on board;
the flood comes and exterminates all living things; the boat comes to
rest on a mountaintop; the hero sends out birds to reconnoiter the
land; when he comes out of the ark he offers a sacrifice to the
god--the same narrative elements are in these two stories. It's just
wonderful when you read them side by side. So what is of great
significance though is not simply that the biblical writer is retelling
a story that clearly went around everywhere in ancient Mesopotamia;
they were <i>transforming</i> the story so that it became a vehicle for
the expression of their own values and their own views. In the
Mesopotamian stories, for example, the gods act capriciously, the gods
act on a whim. In fact, in one of the stories, the gods say, "Oh,
people, they're so noisy, I can't sleep, let's wipe them all out."
That's the rationale. There's no moral scruple. They destroy these
helpless but stoic humans who are chafing under their tyrannical and
unjust and uncaring rule. In the biblical story, when the Israelites
told the story, they modified it. It's God's uncompromising ethical
standards that lead him to bring the flood in an act of divine justice.
He's punishing the evil corruption of human beings that he has so
lovingly created and whose degradation he can't bear to witness. So
it's saying something different. It's providing a very different
message.</p>

<p>So when we compare the Bible with the literature of the Ancient Near
East, we'll see not only the incredible cultural and literary heritage
that was obviously common to them, but we'll see the ideological gulf
that separated them and we'll see how biblical writers so beautifully
and cleverly manipulated and used these stories, as I said, as a
vehicle for the expression of a radically new idea. They drew upon
these sources but they blended and shaped them in a particular way. And
that brings us to a critical problem facing anyone who seeks to
reconstruct ancient Israelite religion or culture on the basis of the
biblical materials. That problem is the conflicting perspective between
the final editors of the text and some of the older sources that are
incorporated into the Bible, some of the older sources that they were
obviously drawing on. Those who were responsible for the final editing,
the final forms of the texts, had a decidedly monotheistic perspective,
ethical monotheistic perspective, and they attempted to impose that
perspective on their older source materials; and for the most part they
were successful. But at times the result of their effort is a deeply
conflicted, deeply ambiguous text. And again, that's going to be one of
the most fun things for you as readers of this text, if you're alert to
it, if you're ready to listen to the cacophony of voices that are
within the text.</p>

<p>In many respects, the Bible represents or expresses a basic
discontent with the larger cultural milieu in which it was produced,
and that's interesting for us, because a lot of modern people have a
tendency to think of the Bible as an emblem of conservatism. Right? We
tend to think of this as an old fuddy-duddy document, it's outdated,
has outdated ideas, and I think the challenge of this course is that
you read the Bible with fresh eyes so that you can appreciate it for
what it was, [and] in many ways what it continues to be: a
revolutionary, cultural critique. We can read the Bible with fresh and
appreciative eyes only if we first acknowledge and set aside some of
our presuppositions about the Bible. It's really impossible, in fact,
that you not have some opinions about this work, because it's an
intimate part of our culture. So even if you've never opened it or read
it yourself, I bet you can cite me a line or two--"an eye for an eye, a
tooth for a tooth," and I bet you don't really know what it means. "The
poor will always be with you": I'm sure you don't really know what that
means. These are things and phrases that we hear and they create within
us a certain impression of the biblical text and how it functions.
Verses are quoted, they're alluded to, whether to be championed and
valorized or whether to be lampooned and pilloried. But we can feel
that we have a rough idea of the Bible and a rough idea of its outlook
when in fact what we really have are popular misconceptions that come
from the way in which the Bible has been used or misused. Most of our
cherished presuppositions about the Bible are based on astonishing
claims that others have made on behalf of the Bible, claims that the
Bible has not made on behalf of itself.</p>

<p>So before we proceed, I need to ask you to set aside for the
purposes of this course, some of the more common myths about the Bible.
I have a little list here for you. The first is the idea that the
Bible's a book. It's not a book. We'll get rid of that one. The Bible
is not a book with all that that implies, that it has a uniform style
and a message and a single author, the sorts of things we think of when
we think in a conventional sense of the word "book." It's a library.
It's an anthology of writings or books written and edited over an
extensive period of time by people in very different situations
responding to very different issues and stimuli, some political, some
historical, some philosophical, some religious, some moral. There are
many types or genres of material in the Bible. There's narrative,
wonderful narrative stories. There's all kinds of law. There are cultic
and ritual texts that prescribe how some ceremony is supposed to be
performed. There are records of the messages of prophets. There's lyric
poetry, there's love poetry, there are proverbs, there are psalms of
thanksgiving and lament. So, there's a tremendous variety of material
in this library, and it follows from the fact that it's not a book but
an anthology of diverse works, that it's not an ideological monolith.
And this is something a lot of students struggle with. Each book, or
strand of tradition within a book, within the biblical collection
sounds its own distinctive note in the symphony of reflection that is
the Bible. Genesis is concerned to account for the origin of things and
wrestles with the existence of evil, the existence of idolatry and
suffering in a world that's created by a good god. The priestly texts
in Leviticus and Numbers emphasize the sanctity of all life and the
ideal of holiness and ethical and ritual purity. There are odes to
human reason and learning and endeavor in the wisdom book of Proverbs.
Ecclesiastes reads like an existentialist writing from the twentieth
century. It scoffs at the vanity of all things, including wisdom, and
espouses a kind of positive existentialism. The Psalms are very
individual writings that focus on individual piety and love and worship
of God. Job, possibly the greatest book of the Bible, I won't give away
my preferences there, challenges conventional religious piety and
arrives at the bittersweet conclusion that there is no justice in this
world or any other, but that nonetheless we're not excused from the
thankless and perhaps ultimately meaningless task of righteous living.
One of the most wonderful and fortuitous facts of history is that later
Jewish communities chose to put all this stuff in this collection we
call the Bible. They chose to include all of these dissonant voices
together. They didn't strive to reconcile the conflicts, nor should we.
They didn't, we shouldn't. Each book, each writer, each voice reflects
another thread in the rich tapestry of human experience, human response
to life and its puzzles, human reflection on the sublime and the
depraved.</p>

<p>And that leads me to my second point, which is that biblical
narratives are not pious parables about saints. Okay? Not pious tales.
They're psychologically real literature about very real or realistic
people and life situations. They're not stories about pious people
whose actions are always exemplary and whose lives should be models for
our own, despite what Sunday School curricula will often turn them
into. And despite what they would have us believe. There <i>is</i> a
genre of literature that details the lives of saints, Hagiography, but
that came later and is largely something we find in the Christian era.
It's not found in the Bible. The Bible abounds with human not
superhuman beings, and their behavior can be scandalous. It can be
violent, it can be rebellious, outrageous, lewd, vicious. But at the
same time like real people, they can turn around and act in a way that
is loyal and true above and beyond the call of duty. They can change,
they can grow. But it's interesting to me that there are many people
who, when they open the Bible for the first time, they close it in
shock and disgust. Jacob is a deceiver; Joseph is an arrogant, spoiled
brat; Judah reneges on his obligations to his daughter-in-law and goes
off and sleeps with a prostitute. Who are these people? Why are they in
the Bible? And the shock comes from the expectation that the heroes of
the Bible are somehow being held up as perfect people. That's just not
a claim that's made by the Bible itself. So biblical characters are
real people with real, compelling moral conflicts and ambitions and
desires, and they can act shortsightedly and selfishly. But they can
also, like real people, learn and grow and change; and if we work too
hard and too quickly to vindicate biblical characters just because
they're in the Bible, then we miss all the good stuff. We miss all of
the moral sophistication, the deep psychological insights that have
made these stories of such timeless interest. So read it like you would
read any good book with a really good author who knows how to make some
really interesting characters.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the Bible's not for children. I have a 12-year-old and an
8-year-old. I won't let them read it. I won't let them read it. Those
"Bible Stories for Children" books, they scare me. They really scare
me. It's not suitable for children. The subject matter in the Bible is
very adult, particularly in the narrative texts. There are episodes of
treachery and incest and murder and rape. And the Bible is not for
naïve optimists. It's hard-hitting stuff. And it speaks to those who
are courageous enough to acknowledge that life is rife with pain and
conflict, just as it's filled with compassion and joy. It's not for
children in another sense. Like any literary masterpiece, the Bible is
characterized by a sophistication of structure and style and an
artistry of theme and metaphor, and believe me, that's lost on adult
readers quite often. It makes its readers work. The Bible doesn't
moralize, or rarely, rarely moralizes. It explores moral issues and
situations, puts people in moral issues and situations. The conclusions
have to be drawn by the reader. There are also all kinds of paradoxes
and subtle puns and ironies, and in section where you'll be doing a lot
of your close reading work, those are some of the things that will be
drawn to your attention. You'll really begin to appreciate them in
time.</p>

<p>The fourth myth we want to get rid of: the Bible is not a book of
theology, it's not a catechism or a book of systematic theology. It's
not a manual of religion, despite the fact that at a much later time,
very complex systems of theology are going to be spun from particular
interpretations of biblical passages. You know, there's nothing in the
Bible that really corresponds to prevailing modern western notions of
religion, what we call religion, and indeed there's no word for
religion in the language of biblical Hebrew. There just isn't a word
"religion." With the rise of Christianity, western religion came to be
defined to a large degree by the confession of, or the intellectual
assent to, certain doctrinal points of belief. Religion became defined
primarily as a set of beliefs, a catechism of beliefs or truths that
required your assent, what I think of as the catechism kind of notion
of religion. That's entirely alien to the world of the Bible. It's
clear that in biblical times and in the Ancient Near East generally,
religion wasn't a set of doctrines that you ascribed to. To become an
Israelite, later on a Jew--the word "Jew" isn't something we can really
historically use until about this time [ca. 500 BCE], so most of our
period we're going to be talking about the ancient Israelites--to
become an Israelite, you simply joined the Israelite community, you
lived an Israelite life, you died an Israelite death. You obeyed
Israelite law and custom, you revered Israelite lore, you entered into
the historical community of Israel by accepting that their fate and
yours should be the same. It was sort of a process of naturalization,
what we think of today as naturalization. So the Hebrew Bible just
isn't a theological textbook. It contains a lot of narratives and its
narrative materials are an account of the odyssey of a <i>people</i>,
the nation of Israel. They're not an account of the divine, which is
what theology means, an account of the divine. However, having said
this, I should add that although the Bible doesn't contain formal
statements of religious belief or systematic theology, it treats
issues, many moral issues and some existential issues that are central
to the later discipline of theology, but it treats them very
differently. Its treatment of these issues is indirect, it's implicit.
It uses the language of story and song and poetry and paradox and
metaphor. It uses a language and a style that's very far from the
language and style of later philosophy and abstract theology.</p>

<p>Finally, on our myth count, I would point out--well I don't really
need to cross this out, this is something to discuss--I would point out
that the Bible was formulated and assembled and edited and modified and
censored and transmitted first orally and then in writing by human
beings. The Bible itself doesn't claim to have been written by God.
That belief is a religious doctrine of a much later age. And even then
one wonders how literally it was meant--it's interesting to go back and
look at some of the earliest claims about the origin of the biblical
text. Similarly, the so-called five books of Moses--Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, the first five books we call the
Pentateuch of Moses--nowhere claim to have been written in their
entirety by Moses. That's not something they say themselves. Some laws
in Exodus, you know, the Book of the Covenant, a few things--yes, it
says Moses wrote those down, but not the whole five books that
tradition later will ascribe to him. The Bible clearly had many
contributors over many centuries, and the individual styles and
concerns of those writers, their political and religious motivations,
betray themselves frequently.</p>

<p>I leave aside here the question of divine inspiration, which is an
article of faith in many biblical religions. It's no doubt an article
of faith for people in this very room. But there is no basic
incompatibility between believing on faith in the divine inspiration of
the Bible and acknowledging the role that human beings have played in
the actual formulation and editing and transmission and preservation of
that same Bible. And since this is a university course and not perhaps
a theological course or within a theological setting, it's really only
the latter, the demonstrably human component, that will concern us.</p>

<p>It's very easy for me to assert that our interest in the Hebrew
Bible will be centered on the culture and the history and the
literature and the religious thought of ancient Israel in all of its
diversity rather than questions of faith and theology. But the fact
remains that the document is the basis for the religious faith of many
millions of people, and some of them are here now. It is inevitable
that you will bring what you learn in this course into dialogue with
your own personal religious beliefs, and for some of you, I hope all of
you, that will be enriching and exciting. For some of you it may be
difficult. I know that, and I want you to rest assured that no one in
this course wishes to undermine or malign religious faith any more than
they wish to promote or proselytize for religious faith. Religious
faith simply isn't the topic of this course. The rich history and
literature and religious thought of ancient Israel as preserved for us
over millennia in the pages of this remarkable volume, that is our
topic, and so our approach is going to be necessarily academic; and
especially given the diversity of people in this room, that's really
all that it can be, so that we have a common ground and common goals
for our discussions. But it has been my experience that from time to
time students will raise a question or ask a question that is prompted
by a commitment, a prior commitment to an article of faith. Sometimes
they're not even aware that that's what they're doing, and I want you
to understand that on those occasions I'll most likely respond by
inviting you to consider the article of faith that lies behind that
question and is creating that particular problem for you. I'm not going
to be drawn into a philosophical or theological debate over the merits
of that belief, but I'll simply point out how or why that belief might
be making it difficult for you to read or accept what the text is
actually and not ideally saying, and leave you to think about that. And
I see those as wonderful learning opportunities for the class. Those
are in no way a problem for me.</p>

<p>All right, so let's give a few sort of necessary facts and figures
now about the Bible and then I need to talk a little bit about the
organization of the course. So those are the last two things we really
need to do. An overview of the structure of the Bible. So you have a
couple of handouts that should help you here. So, the Bible is this
assemblage of books and writings dating from approximately 1000
BCE--we're going to hear very diverse opinions about how far back this
stuff dates--down to the second century: the last book within the
Hebrew Bible was written in the 160s BCE. Some of these books which we
think are roughly from a certain date, they will contain narrative
snippets or legal materials or oral traditions that may even date back
or stretch back further in time, and they were perhaps transmitted
orally and then ended up in these written forms. The Bible is written
largely in Hebrew, hence the name Hebrew Bible. There are a few
passages in Aramaic. So you have a handout that breaks down the three
major components. It's the one that's written two columns per page.
Okay? We're going to talk in a minute about those three sections, so
you want to have that handy.</p>

<p>These writings have had a profound and lasting impact on three world
religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. For the Jewish communities
who first compiled these writings in the pre-Christian era, the Bible
was perhaps first and foremost a record of God's eternal covenant with
the Jewish people. So Jews refer to the Bible as the <i>Tanakh</i>.
It's the term you see up here. It should be also on that sheet,
<i>Tanakh</i>, which is really the letter [sounds] "t", "n" and "kh",
and they've put little "a's" in there to make it easy to pronounce,
because kh is hard to pronounce, so Tanach. Okay? And this is an
acronym. The T stands for Torah, which is a word that means instruction
or teaching. It's often translated "law"; I think that's a very poor
translation. It means instruction, way, teaching, and that refers to
the first five books that you see listed here, Genesis through
Deuteronomy. The second division of the Bible is referred to as
<i>Nevi'im</i>, which is the Hebrew word for "prophets." The section of
the Prophets is divided really into two parts, because there are two
types of writing in the prophetic section of the Bible. The first or
former Prophets continues the kind of narrative prose account of the
history of Israel, focusing on the activities of Israel's prophets. All
right? So, the Former Prophets are narrative texts. The Latter Prophets
are poetic and oracular writings that bear the name of the prophet to
whom the writings are ascribed. You have the three major prophets,
Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and then the twelve minor prophets, which
in the Hebrew Bible get counted together as one book, because those
twelve are very small. The final section of the Bible is referred to as
<i>Ketuvim</i> in Hebrew, which simply means "Writings," and that's
probably about 50% of the Hebrew you're going to get in the whole
course, so please don't be scared. You know, I've got two or three
other terms that'll be useful along the way, but there's really no need
to know Hebrew. I just want you to understand why <i>Tanakh</i> is the
word that's used to refer to the Bible. So the <i>Ketuvim</i>, or the
Writings, are really a miscellany. They contain works of various types,
and the three parts correspond very roughly to the process of
canonization or authoritativeness for the community. The Torah probably
reached a fixed and authoritative status first, then the books of the
Prophets and finally the Writings. And probably by the end of the first
century, all of this was organized in some way.</p>

<p>If you look at the other handout, you'll see, however, that any
course on the Bible is going to run immediately into the problem of
defining the object of study, because different Bibles served different
communities over the centuries. One of the earliest translations of the
Hebrew Bible was a translation into Greek known as the Septuagint. It
was written for the benefit--it was translated for the benefit of Jews
who lived in Alexandria--Greek-speaking Jews who lived in Alexandria,
Egypt in the Hellenistic period somewhere around the third or second
century BCE. The translation has some divergences with the traditional
Hebrew text of the Bible as we now have it, including the order of the
books, and some of these things are charted for you on the chart that
I've handed out. The Septuagint's rationale for ordering the books is
temporal. They've clustered books Genesis through Esther, which tell of
things past; the books of Job through the Song of Songs or the Song of
Solomon contain wisdom that applies to the present; and then the
prophetic books, Isaiah to Malachi, contain or tell of things future.
Some copies of the Septuagint contain some books not included in the
Hebrew canon but accepted in the early Christian canon. The Septuagint,
the Greek translation, became by and large the Bible of Christianity,
or more precisely it became the "Old Testament" of the Hebrew Bible
[correction: Professor Hayes meant to say Christian Bible instead of
Hebrew Bible here]. The church adopted the Hebrew Bible as a precursor
to its largely Hellenistic gospels. It was an important association for
it, with an old and respected tradition. Our primary concern is the
Bible of the ancient Israelite and Jewish community--the 24 books
grouped in the Torah, Prophets and Writings on that other sheet--which
is common to all Bibles. Whether Jewish or Christian, those 24 are the
baseline common books. So those are the 24 that we're going to focus
on.</p>

<p>Because the term "Old Testament" is a theologically loaded term, it
sort of suggests the doctrine that the New Testament has somehow
fulfilled or surpassed or antiquated the Bible of ancient Israel,
you're going to hear me refer to the object of our study as the Hebrew
Bible. You may certainly use any other term, and you may certainly use
the term Old Testament, as long as it's clear we're talking about this
set of 24 books and not some of the other things that are in the Old
Testament that aren't in the traditional Hebrew Bible. It means you're
studying less, so that might be a good thing. So, it's fine with me if
you want to use that but I will prefer the more accurate term "Hebrew
Bible." Also while we're on terminology, you'll notice that I use BCE
to refer to the period before 0 and CE to refer to the period after 0;
the Common Era and Before the Common Era, and in a lot of your
secondary readings and writings they'll be using the same thing. It
corresponds to what you know as BC, Before Christ, and Anno Domini, AD,
the year of our Lord. It's just a non-Christian-centric way of dating
and in a lot of your secondary readings you'll see it, so you should
get used to it: BCE and CE, Before the Common Era and the Common
Era.</p>

<p>From earliest times, Christians made use of the Bible but almost
always in its Greek translation, and the Christian Old Testament
contains some material not in the Hebrew Bible, as I've mentioned. And
some of these works are referred to as the Apocrypha--so [some of] you
will have heard that term. These are writings that were composed
somewhere around here, sort of 200 BCE to 100 CE. They were widely used
by Jews of the period. They simply weren't considered to be of the same
status as the 24 books. [beeping noise] I'm glad they pick up the
garbage at 11:10 [laughs] on Wednesday mornings. But they did become
part of the canon of Catholic Christianity and in the sixteenth
century, their canonical status was confirmed for the Catholic Church.
With the Renaissance and the Reformation, some Christians became
interested in Hebrew versions of the Bible. They wanted to look at the
Hebrew and not the Greek translation from the Hebrew. Protestants, the
Protestant church, denied canonical status to the books of the
Apocrypha. They said they were important for pious instruction but
excluded them from their canon. There are also some works you may know
of, referred to as the Pseudepigrapha--we'll talk about some of these
things in a little more detail later--from roughly the same period;
[they] tend to be a little more apocalyptic in nature, and they were
never part of the Jewish or the Catholic canon, but there are some
eastern Christian groups that have accepted them in their canon. The
point I'm trying to make is that there are very many sacred canons out
there that are cherished by very many religious communities, and
they're all designated "Bibles." So again, we're focusing on that core
set of 24 books that are common to all Bibles everywhere, the 24 books
of what would in fact be the Jewish <i>Tanakh</i>.</p>

<p>Not only has there been variety regarding the scope of the biblical
canon in different communities, but there's been some fluidity in the
actual text itself. We don't, of course, have any original copies of
these materials as they came off the pen of whoever it was who was
writing them, and in fact before the middle of the twentieth century,
our oldest manuscripts and fragments of manuscripts of the Bible dated
to the year 900. That's an awful long distance from the events they're
talking about. And we've got to think about that, right? You've got to
think about that and what it means and how were they transmitted and
preserved without the means of technology, obviously, that we have
today; and what was so exciting in the middle of the twentieth century
was the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. I'm sure that you've heard
of them. They brought about a dramatic change in the state of our
knowledge of our Hebrew manuscript evidence. The Dead Sea Scrolls were
found in caves in the Judean desert. We used to think they were a
library of a sectarian community; now I think they think it was a
pottery factory or something. So maybe they were just shoved there by
people fleeing the Roman conquest in 70 [see note 1].</p>

<p>So that's up for grabs. But we have this really great collection of
scrolls, and among them we have found an almost complete copy of every
book of the Bible. Sorry--almost complete copy of the Book of Isaiah
and then partial copies or fragments of all of the biblical books,
except maybe Esther. Am I wrong about that? I don't think there's an
Esther from Qumran, I think that's the only one. [This is correct. No
book of Esther has been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.] And some of
them date back to the fourth and third century [BCE]. So do you
understand now why everybody was so excited? Suddenly, we have
evidence, thirteen or fourteen hundred years earlier, that people were
reading this stuff and, by and large, it's a pretty constant textual
tradition. Sure there are differences, sure there are differences. We
see that our manuscripts are not exactly like those fragments, but
there is a remarkable degree, a high degree of correspondence so that
we really can speak of a relatively stable textual tradition but still
some fluidity. And that's going to be interesting for us to think
about.</p>

<p>There are many translations of the Bible, but I would like you to
purchase for this course the <i>Jewish Study Bible</i> [see
References]. So let me turn now to just some of the administrative,
organizational details of the course, the secondary readings that we'll
be using. I'm asking you to pick up the <i>Jewish Study Bible</i> not
only for the translation of the <i>Tanakh</i>, which is a very good
translation, but because it contains wonderful scholarly articles in
the back. It used to be we had a course packet for this course that was
two volumes, and now with the purchase of this, I've been able to
really consolidate the readings. They're really wonderful; great
introductions to the individual books of the Bible and so I think you
will find that this will become like a Bible to you [laughs]. So you
need to pick that up. It's at the Yale bookstore. I also would like you
to pick up this paperback, it's not terribly expensive. We're going to
be using it in the first few weeks especially: <i>The Ancient Near
East</i> [see References]. Other readings, the secondary readings for
the course, are all already online [for on-campus students]. I will be
also making them available at Allegra [bookstore] for people who would
like to just purchase them already printed out so you don't do it
yourself, but I know some people really prefer to work online--and
certainly for the first week of reading, you can get started because it
is online. I don't think things will be available at Allegra's until
probably tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<p>The syllabus. As you can see, it's a pretty thick syllabus, but it's
divided into a schedule of lectures and then a schedule of readings.
All right? So, understand that there are two distinct things there.
It's not just all the scheduled lectures. The last few pages are a
schedule of the actual readings, and the assignment that you'll have
for the weekend and for next week's lectures are the readings by
Kaufman. I really, really need you to read that before the next class,
and I want you to read it critically. Kaufman's ideas are important,
but they are also overstated, and so they're going to be interesting
for us. We're going to wrestle with his claims quite a bit during the
course of the semester. The secondary readings are heavier at the
beginning of the course when we are reading very small segments of
biblical text. That will shift. Right? Towards the end of the course
you're going to be reading, you know, a couple of books in the Bible
and maybe a ten-page article of secondary reading; so, you know, it's
front loaded with secondary readings. So you'll want to get started on
the Kaufman, because for the first few weeks it's quite a bit of
secondary reading but we're covering just a few chapters of Bible each
time in the first few weeks.</p>

<p>Sections: We're going to be doing this online registration thing
that I've never done before, so I hope it works. We do have three
teaching fellows for this course. I hope that will be sufficient.
Actually, if the teaching fellows could stand up so people could at
least recognize you, that would be wonderful. Anyone wants to
volunteer, we could have a fourth. Okay, so we have two in the back
there, we have Tudor Sala raising his hand and Tzvi Novick here. They
will be running regular discussion sections and then Kristine Garroway
will be running a writing requirement section. I don't think that was
listed in the Blue Book [Yale College Programs of Study], but it
should've been listed online that it is possible to fulfill your
writing skills requirement through this course. So Kristine will be
running that. We will bring on Monday--so please have your schedules as
well-formed as they are, on Monday--we will put up times and we will
take a straw poll to figure out if we can accommodate everybody within
the times.</p>

<p>One more extremely important announcement, it's on your syllabus,
but I want to underline it even more than it is already underlined and
boldfaced. I want to underline the importance of the section
discussions in this course. In fact, it's really wrong to call them
section discussions. It sounds like you're discussing the lectures and
the readings and you're really not. The section discussions are a
complement to the lectures. What I mean is: this is an awfully big
thing to spend just one semester studying, and I can't do it all, and
in my lectures I'll be trying to set broad themes and patterns and
describe what's going on, but I want you to have the experience of
actually sitting and reading chunks of text and struggling with that
and understanding the history of interpretation of passages and how so
many important things have happened historically because of people's
efforts to understand this text. So in sections, a large part of the
focus in section will be on specific passages, reading and struggling
with the text, the kind of thing I can't do in lecture. This is
important because your final paper assignment will be an exercise in
exegesis, an interpretation. The skills that you will need for that
paper I am fairly certain are not things that you would've acquired in
high school and, if we have some upperclassmen--I don't know, but maybe
not even some upperclassmen will have acquired here yet. Exegesis is a
very particular kind of skill and the teaching fellows will be
introducing you to methods of exegesis. So it's really a training
ground for the final paper, and we have found that people don't succeed
in the course in the final paper without the training they get in
section discussion, which is why section participation is worth ten
percent of your grade. However, if there are repeated, unexcused
absences, there will be an adjustment in the grade calculation, and it
will be worth twenty to twenty-five percent of your grade, and it will
be a negative grade also. And believe me, this is a favor to you. It is
definitely a favor to you. These sections are critically important in
this course. Okay? So, if you have any questions, I can hang around for
a few minutes, but thank you for coming. We'll see you Monday.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Notes</p>

<p>1. This most recent challenge to the long-standing hypothesis that
the settlement at Qumran near the Dead Sea was home to a monastic sect,
has been issued by archaeologists Yitzhak Magen and Yuval Peleg. In
"Back to Qumran: Ten years of Excavations and Research, 1993-2004," in
<i>The Site of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Archaeological Interpretation and
Debate</i>, eds. Katharina Galor, Jean-Baptiste Humbert, and Jurgen
Zangenberg (Brill, 2006), Magen and Yuval argue that Qumran was the
site of a pottery factory, and that there is no essential connection
between the activity of the site and the library of scrolls found in
near-by caves. The view has raised interest but has not replaced the
prevailing consensus that the scrolls were the library of a monastic
sect that lived at Qumran.</p>
