<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> Last time we started looking at
the psalms and a number of different genres or forms in which the
psalms appear. We were just looking at a psalm last time which seems to
explicitly reject the Deuteronomistic interpretation of the national
history and the national tragedy, depicting Israel as innocent, and
rebuking God for his inaction.</p>

<p>There's another psalm in this genre that I'd like to read from. This
is Psalm 44, selective passages:</p>

<blockquote>"…In God we glory at all times,<br />
 and praise Your name unceasingly.<br />
 Yet You have rejected and disgraced us;<br />
 You do not go with our armies.<br />
 …You let them devour us like sheep;<br />
 You disperse us among the nations.<br />
 You sell Your people for no fortune,<br />
 You set no high price on them…<br />
 All this has come upon us,<br />
 yet we have not forgotten You,<br />
 or been false to Your covenant." [Very different from what the
prophets have been screaming!]<br />
 "Our hearts have not gone astray,<br />
 nor have our feet swerved from Your path,<br />
 though You cast us, crushed, to where the sea monster is,<br />
 and covered us over with deepest darkness.<br />
 If we forgot the name of our God<br />
 and spread forth our hands to a foreign god,<br />
 God would surely search it out,<br />
 for He knows the secrets of the heart.<br />
 It is for Your sake that we are slain all day long,<br />
 that we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.<br />
 Rouse Yourself; why do you sleep, O Lord?<br />
 Awaken, do not reject us forever!<br />
 Why do You hide Your face,<br />
 ignoring our affliction and distress?<br />
 We lie prostrate in the dust;<br />
 our body clings to the ground.<br />
 Arise and help us,<br />
 redeem us, as befits Your faithfulness."</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So here's a psalm full of anger that contains an explicit denial of
the rhetorically inflamed charges against Israel that we read in many
of the prophetic books. We have <i>not</i> forgotten You, we
<i>haven't</i> been false to Your covenant, our hearts <i>haven't</i>
gone astray, we <i>haven't</i> swerved from Your path. Why are You
behaving this way?</p>

<p>This astonishing protestation of innocence that accuses God of
sleeping on the job is reminiscent of Job. In a way, the two
conflicting viewpoints that we see running through a lot of this
literature--one in which: there is suffering, therefore there must be
sin, Israel has sinned horribly: and the other: there is inexplicable
suffering, we haven't done anything that would deserve this, anything
at all--it really is reminiscent of Job. It seems to give us these two
perspectives on Job's suffering as an individual. We see that now
played out on the level of the nation. What we have here is a view that
is asserting God's negligence rather than Israel's guilt.</p>

<p>Then you can contrast psalms like 44, the one I've just read, and
74, which I read at the end of the last lecture, with Psalms 78 and
106. These psalms belong to the category of hymns, and some people call
this category 'hymns in celebration of divine action in Israel's
history'--the sort of historical reviews that praise God for all he has
done for Israel; and they toe the Deuteronomistic line in their
recapitulation of Israel's history. From the Creation, from the Exodus
and on to the conquest of the Promised Land, they stress Israel's utter
indebtedness to God. God has patiently endured Israel's constant
faithlessness. So when you juxtapose these two types of psalms, they're
just remarkably different.</p>

<p>[Psalm 78]</p>

<blockquote>He performed marvels in the site of their fathers,<br />
 in the land of Egypt, the plain of Zoan.<br />
 He split the sea and took them through it;<br />
 He made the waters stand like a wall.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It continues: "…He split rocks in the wilderness"--so it's a
recounting of all the marvelous things that God has done,</p>

<blockquote>But they went on sinning against Him,<br />
 defying the most high in the parched land.<br />
 To test God was in their mind<br />
 when they demanded food for themselves.<br />
 They spoke against God, saying,<br />
 "Can God spread a feast in the wilderness?<br />
 True, He struck the rock and waters flowed,<br />
 streams gushed forth;<br />
 but can He provide bread?<br />
 Can He supply His people with meat?</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It's interesting that this is in the third person; <i>they</i> did
all these terrible sinful things.</p>

<p>The psalm that I just read previously that protests Israel's
innocence is in the first person. We have not strayed at all. We've
been completely faithful to you, why are you treating us this way? So
God's faithful actions, Israel's faithless responses are featured in
the psalm that I just read and also in 106. They toe the
Deuteronomistic line, and again we see this clear attempt to explain
Israel's tragic end. Here again the tendency is to blame Israel and to
justify God at all costs.</p>

<p>We move on now to the genre of psalms. Actually, these are two
genres that I'm putting together, the genres of blessing and cursing.
Obviously they're rather antithetical. But first of all, psalms of
blessing are psalms that invoke God to bless the righteous. It might be
the nation Israel or it might be the righteous within the nation, and
to punish or afflict the wicked, and again, that can be enemy nations
or it can be the wicked within Israel and other nations. And sometimes
these psalms can be quite shocking in their violence and in their
fury.</p>

<p>Psalm 137, "By the rivers of Babylon"--very rarely people read all
the way to the end of that particular psalm. It's very poignant at the
beginning, but at the very end it calls for vengeance on the
Babylonians who destroyed Jerusalem, verses 8 and 9, "Fair Babylon, you
predator, / a blessing on him who repays you in kind / what you have
inflicted on us; a blessing on him who seizes your babies / and dashes
them against the rocks!"</p>

<p>Psalm 109 contains this very lengthy list of terrible afflictions
that the psalmist is asking God to smite his foes with (that was a
poorly constructed sentence!), that the psalmist is asking God to, I
don't want to say bestow, but inflict upon his foe. Verses 8 and 10:
"May his days be few, may another take over his position. May his
children be orphans, / his wife a widow"--that's a nice way of saying
"may he die."</p>

<blockquote>May his children wander from their hovels,<br />
 begging in search of [bread].<br />
 ...May he be clothed in a curse like a garment,<br />
 may it enter his body like water,<br />
 his bones like oil.<br />
 Let it be like the cloak he wraps around him,<br />
 like the belt he always wears.<br />
 May the Lord thus repay my accusers,<br />
 all those who speak evil against me.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So again, it's hardly the simple piety that we often associate with
the Book of Psalms.</p>

<p>The last category I just want to briefly mention is a category of
psalms that have a reflective or meditative tone. These are psalms of
wisdom, psalms in praise of instruction or Torah and meditation. They
are somewhat proverbial in nature, many of them will begin with the
sort of stock phrase, "Happy is the man who…" so we see that in Psalm
128:</p>

<blockquote>Happy are all who fear the Lord,<br />
 who follow His ways.<br />
 You shall enjoy the fruit of your labors;<br />
 you shall be happy and shall prosper.<br />
 Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine within your house;<br />
 your sons, like olive saplings around your table.<br />
 So shall the man who fears the Lord be blessed."<br />
Or "reveres the Lord" – [that] is the sense of "fear"
there.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Many psalms we've seen seem to presuppose worship in the temple, and
can even have that antiphonal character, the call and response, or call
and echo character. But there are three that, instead, have this theme
of meditating upon or delighting in the Torah; that's Psalm 1, Psalm
19, and Psalm 119 (conveniently enough!).</p>

<p>119 is the longest psalm because it's written in acrostic form.
There are different stanzas, a different stanza for each letter of the
alphabet (22 letters) and there are eight lines in each stanza, all
eight lines beginning with that letter of the alphabet, so it's a very,
very long psalm.</p>

<p>The psalm represents Torah as an object of study and devotion.
Studying Torah makes one wise and happy: Psalm 19, verses 8 through
11,</p>

<blockquote>The teaching of the Lord is perfect,<br />
 renewing life;<br />
 the decrees of the Lord are enduring,<br />
 making the simple wise;<br />
 The precepts of the Lord are just,<br />
 rejoicing the heart;<br />
 the instruction of the Lord is lucid,<br />
 making the eyes light up.<br />
 The fear (or reverence) of the Lord is pure,<br />
 abiding forever;<br />
 the judgments of the Lord are true,<br />
 righteous altogether,<br />
 more desirable than gold,<br />
 than much fine gold;<br />
 sweeter than honey,<br />
 than drippings of the comb.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So this elevation of Torah reflects the shift that begins or starts
to occur in the Second Temple Period, the late Second Temple Period, in
which Torah is of growing importance. In about two minutes we're going
to start to talk about this period and the importance and centrality of
Torah--its centrality in terms of study --and the study of Torah as a
form of worship.</p>

<p>So there are many different ways to categorize and classify the
psalms. Many individual psalms seem to combine units that belong to
different categories. So, for example, you have Psalm 22 which opens as
a lament, "My God, My God why have You forsaken me?" That's the
well-known RSV translation, and then it changes to a hymn of praise. It
concludes with this--it goes on into a kind of confident triumph.</p>

<p>At least one psalm, Psalm 68, really defies any kind of rigid
categorization, so we can't be too strict in trying to impose these
forms. They are helpful guides to the interpretation of the Psalms, but
again, we can't be too rigid about it.</p>

<p>But from the sampling that we've seen it should be apparent that the
Psalms are a microcosm of the religious insights and convictions of
ancient Israelites. Perhaps because so many of them lack historical
specificity--some of them are quite historical; some of them in fact
recount Israel's history in order to praise God, but many of them,
very, very many of them lack any real historical specificity, and that
is probably the reason that the Psalms have become a great source for
personal spirituality in Western civilization.</p>

<p>Some of them were composed perhaps as many as 3000 years ago, and
yet, they can be inspiring or they can feel relevant to contemporary
readers. They can provide an opportunity to confess one's failings or
to proclaim good intentions, or to rail against misfortune, or to cry
out against injustice, or to request assistance, or to affirm trust in
divine providence, or to simply express emotions of praise and joy, and
wonder at creation, or reflect on human finitude in the face of divine
infinitude.</p>

<p>I mentioned briefly the centrality of Torah--actually no--let me
finish talking about Psalms and also move onto another major poetic
work then we'll come back to talk about the Restoration period.</p>

<p>Another poetic book within the anthology of the Hebrew Bible is the
little work known as the Song of Songs. And for many people this is
perhaps the most surprising book to be included in the Hebrew canon.
It's a beautiful and very erotic love song that celebrates human
sexuality and physical passion.</p>

<p>The opening line seems to be a late superscription that attributes
the book to Solomon, and it seems more likely however that these
sensuous love lyrics are post-exilic. The attribution to Solomon was
probably fueled by the fact that in 1 Kings 4, we read that Solomon--or
there's a tradition there that Solomon uttered 3,000 Proverbs and 1,005
songs. So it seems natural to attribute this song to Israel's most
prolific composer of songs and proverbs, according to tradition.</p>

<p>The speaker in the poem alternates, most often it is a woman. She
seems to be addressing her beloved. Sometimes she addresses other
women, the daughters of Jerusalem. At times the speaker is a man, but
he's not identified as Solomon. Solomon's name is mentioned about six
times, but Solomon is not said to be one of the speakers and for the
most part the main speaker is female.</p>

<p>There's a pastoral setting for the book. The two young lovers
express their passion through and amid the beauties of nature. There
are frequent references to gardens, and vineyards, and fruit, and
flowers, and perfumes, and doves, and flocks of goats, and shorn ewes.
There are very vivid descriptions of the physical beauty of the lovers.
They are described in highly erotic passages. Translations of the Song
of Songs vary tremendously as you might imagine, so I'm going to read
one little section from the translation by someone named Walsh, C.E.
Walsh, which I think captures the tremendous eroticism in some of the
passages of Song of Songs:</p>

<blockquote>I slept, but my heart was awake.<br />
 Listen, my lover is knocking.<br />
 "Open to me my sister, my love,<br />
 my dove, my perfect one,<br />
 for my head is wet with dew…"<br />
 My lover thrusts his hand into the hole,<br />
 and my insides yearned for him,<br />
 I arose to open to my lover,<br />
 and my hands dripped with myrrh,<br />
 my fingers with liquid myrrh,<br />
 upon the handles of the lock.<br />
 I opened to my lover,<br />
 but he was gone. [Walsh 2006, 111-12]</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>These poems are very unique. They give expression to the erotic
feelings of a woman and, as I say, translations will vary tremendously.
According to Jewish tradition, the ancient Rabbis debated over whether
or not the Song of Songs should be included in the canon. And it was
Rabbi Akiva, a late first- early second-century sage, whose view
prevailed. He declared "the whole world was only created, so to speak,
for the day on which the Song of Songs would be given to it. Why?
Because all the writings are Holy, but the Song of Songs is the Holy of
Holies."</p>

<p>But for some religious authorities over the centuries, the candid
descriptions of passionate love proved to be too much, and so the
explicit content of the book (which contains no reference to God, by
the way; God is not mentioned anywhere in the Song of Songs, so it
seems to have been a completely secular poem originally)--the explicit
content of the book has at times been interpreted away. So not only do
we have translations that tone down a great deal of the eroticism, but
we also have a tradition of interpretation that interprets away a lot
of the explicit content of the text.</p>

<p>So we have trends within Jewish tradition that read the book as a
metaphor or an expression of God's love for his chosen people, Israel.
Christians have allegorized the song, seeing it as an expression of
Christ's love for his bride who is the spiritual church. And I think
some--I think all of the sections will be dealing with the Song of
Songs this week, so you should have an interesting time looking at some
of the interpretations of this text.</p>

<p>Now I want to move on a little bit more to the historical background
of some of the books that we'll be looking at in today's lecture and
then also the last couple of lectures.</p>

<p>We left the Israelites in exile in Babylon. And in 539 BCE the
Babylonian Empire was itself defeated by the Persians under the
leadership of Cyrus--Cyrus of Persia. In 539 he manages to establish
the largest empire that's been seen in the Ancient Near East to date.
It stretches from Egypt all the way north up to Asia Minor which is
modern-day Turkey, and all the way over to Eastern Iran; a huge
empire.</p>

<p>Unlike other ancient empires, the Persian Empire espoused a policy
of cultural and religious independence for its conquered subjects. The
famous Cyrus Cylinder--this is a nine inch long fired clay cylinder and
it's covered in cuneiform writing--it tells of Cyrus' conquest of
Babylon. The conquest is described as being at the command of Babylon's
god, Marduk, so obviously the Babylonians' god Marduk wanted "our Cyrus
of Persia" to be able to come in and conquer this nation. It tells of
his conquest and it tells of Cyrus' policy of allowing captives to
return to their homelands and to rebuild their temples and worship
their gods. This is consistent; this archaeological find is consistent
with the picture that's presented in the Bible.</p>

<p>According to the biblical text we'll be discussing soon, Cyrus in
538 gave the Judean exiles permission to return to Jerusalem and
reconstruct their temple. The exiles did return; <i>many</i> of the
exiles returned. They returned to what was now a Persian province: it's
the province of Yehud; I don't think I wrote that up there. Yehud is
the name now of Judea and Yehud is where we're going to get the word
Jew. Yehudi is the word Jew; one who belongs to the province of Yehud.
So many of the exiles returned to this now-Persian province Yehud, and
they exercised a fair degree of self determination.</p>

<p>Now, periodization of Jewish history tends to center on these
events, so the period from 586 to 538 or so--that's known as exilic
period. Most scholars maintain that the traditions of the priestly
source, the traditions of the Deuteronomistic source had pretty well
reached their final form in those years. Obviously, older traditions go
into the composition of those corpora, but they reach their final form
for the most part in that period.</p>

<p>So the post-exilic period following is also known as the Persian
period, at first, but of course the Persians won't rule for long.
Alexander's going to come marching through the Ancient Near East, so
after the Persians we'll have the Hellenistic Period. But the period
after the exile is referred to as the Persian period, the period of the
Restoration, [or] the post-exilic period. It's also called the Second
Temple Period because by about 520 they will have reconstructed the
temple; so it's not inaccurate really to refer to this time as the
Second Temple Period. The second temple will stand until 70, the year
70 of the Common Era. So the period, of course, before the exile we
think of as the First Temple Period (the temple is destroyed in 586),
so the first temple period or pre-exilic period.</p>

<p>Now, the books of First and Second Chronicles provide a second
account of the history of Israel. Genesis all the way through 2 Kings
has given us one long account. FirstChronicles actually begins with
Adam and it does go through--1 and 2 Chronicles do go up to the
Babylonian exile. They echo a good deal of what we find in the Books of
Samuel and Kings, but they have more of a priestly bias and they
eliminate a lot of material that sheds a poor light on Israel's kings.
So, for example, you won't find the story of David and Bathsheba when
you're reading the Chronicles account of the reign of David.</p>

<p>So Chronicles is already an interpretation. It's an inner-biblical
interpretation. It is the Bible interpreting itself. A later strand of
tradition reflecting on earlier strands of tradition and re-presenting
that material in a particular light. The Chronicler is less interested
in David's political genius, for example; it doesn't go into his
strategy and his political accomplishments nearly so much as it does go
into his role in establishing Jerusalem as a religious capital, in
planning a temple, in organizing the music for temple worship. These
are the interests of the Chronicler.</p>

<p>The Book of 2 Chronicles concludes with the decree of Cyrus,
permitting the Jewish captives to return to their homeland and build
their temple. We have a second, fuller version of this decree, which as
I said, seems to be consistent with what we know of Persian
policies--the policy of tolerating and even encouraging local religious
cults. So that fuller version appears in Ezra.</p>

<p>I'm going to read first from 2 Chronicles. 2 Chronicles
36:22-23,</p>

<blockquote>And in the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, when the
word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah was fulfilled, the Lord roused the
spirit of King Cyrus of Persia to issue a proclamation throughout his
realm by word of mouth and in writing, as follows: "Thus said King
Cyrus of Persia: The Lord God of Heaven has given me all the kingdoms
of the earth, and has charged me with building Him a House in
Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Any one of you of all of His people, the
Lord His God be with him and let him go up.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Then in Ezra there is an addition. Ezra 1:3 and 4,</p>

<blockquote>…let Him go up to Jerusalem that is in Judah, and build the
House of the Lord God of Israel, the God that is in Jerusalem; and all
who stay behind, wherever he may be living, let the people of his place
assist him with silver, gold, goods, and livestock, besides the
freewill offering to the House of God that is in
Jerusalem.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Notice that the decree at the very beginning in Chronicles--in the 2
Chronicles version--the decree is said to fulfill the word of the
prophet Jeremiah. Now, you remember that Jeremiah prophesied that the
Babylonian exile would last 70 years; he wrote a letter, he said settle
down, this is going to last a while, plant plants and build homes. So
he had prophesied 70 years for an exile. Well, from the time of the
first departure of exiles in 597, maybe to the return in 538, 61
years--it's close. If you look from the destruction of the first temple
perhaps in 586 to the completion of the second somewhere between 520,
515, we're not really sure, that's about 70 years. Either way, it seems
that in the eyes of the Chronicler it was close enough. This seems to
have been a fulfillment of Jeremiah's prediction. That it would be
about 70 years before they would return.</p>

<p>So the books of Ezra and Nehemiah give an account of the return of
the Babylonian exiles in the late sixth and fifth century. And Ezra and
Nehemiah were regarded as a unit; those two books were regarded as a
unit in the Hebrew Bible, until the Middle Ages. They may in fact have
formed part of a larger historical work; Ezra, Nehemiah, 1 and 2
Chronicles.</p>

<p>Ezra, and to a lesser degree, Nehemiah seem to have a good deal in
common with Chronicles, and therefore may derive from the same author.
So sometimes in secondary literature you will see references to the
Chronicler, which refers to the hypothetical author of 1 and
2Chronicles and Ezra and possibly Nehemiah.</p>

<p>The chapters report the initial return of the exiles, the rebuilding
of the temple, the career of Ezra, and the career of Nehemiah. All four
of the books were probably edited in the late fifth century BCE, maybe
close to the fourth century--that's our best guess--when Judah was a
small province still within the massive Persian Empire.</p>

<p>The books of Ezra and Nehemiah, however, contain conflicting
information about the return, about the restoration, and as a result
our knowledge of the timing of various events is quite poor. It's
really not clear who returned first to help rebuild Jerusalem, whether
it was Ezra a priest, or Nehemiah a scribe. He was a
Persian--;[correction]: not a scribe, he was a governor. Ezra was a
priest and scribe, Nehemiah was a Persian appointed governor of
Judah.</p>

<p>And even though the Chronicler dates events according to the year of
the reign of the Persian king, the king is Artaxerxes, and
unfortunately there are two kings named Artaxerxes in the fifth century
and there's one in the fourth, so it's extremely difficult to figure
out when these events happened. So keeping in mind that even the
experts cannot agree at all on the sequence of events, we are simply
going to look at the career of Ezra, the career of Nehemiah. I'm not
going to claim priority for either of them.</p>

<p>Because the events are not presented in chronological order, even in
the books, I'm going to skip fairly freely around, back and forth
between the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah.</p>

<p>So the Book of Ezra opens with Cyrus' decree, which we've heard, and
then provides a long list of the exiles who returned to Judah after
538. They're led by Sheshbazzar; and then among the exiles he says
there was Yeshua who was a priest and Zerubbavel. Zerubbavel was a
grandson of King Jehoiakim who was the last Davidic king who had been
kept in house arrest in Babylon. He had been among the exiles in 597,
he eventually had been released from house arrest in Babylon, so now
his grandson Zerubbavel, a Davidide, was returning to Jerusalem, and
you can imagine that this would have stirred hope in the hearts of
many.</p>

<p>Chapter 3 of Ezra describes the sacrifices offered on a rebuilt
altar and the beginning of the process of rebuilding the temple,
probably around 521 or so:</p>

<blockquote>When the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of
the Lord, priests in their vestments with trumpets, and Levites sons of
Asaph with cymbals were stationed to give praise to the Lord, as King
David of Israel had ordained. They sang songs extolling and praising
the Lord, "For He is good, His steadfast love for Israel is eternal."
All the people raised a great shout extolling the Lord because the
foundation of the House of the Lord had been laid. Many of the priests
and Levites and chiefs of the clans, the old men who had seen the first
house [=the first temple], wept loudly at the sight of the founding of
this house. Many others shouted joyously at the top of their voices.
The people could not distinguish the shouts of joy from the people's
weeping, for the people raised a great shout, the sound of which could
be heard from afar.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So the older generations who remember the magnificence of the first
temple of Solomon shed tears. The younger people are shouting for joy
at the establishment of a new temple.</p>

<p>But the building doesn't proceed smoothly and that's due largely to
the hostilities of the surrounding communities. These surrounding
communities are referred to adversaries, adversaries of Judah and
Benjamin. In chapters 4, 5, and 6 these Samaritans in many cases, offer
to assist in the project of reconstruction. Their offer is rejected,
and as a result the Samaritans, insulted, persuade the Persians that
this is a bad idea. Rebuilding a potentially rebellious city is a bad
idea, and the Persians listen to them and they order the rebuilding
stopped.</p>

<p>There are two prophets then, Haggai and Zechariah. So these are
prophets now of the post-exilic period. As we go through our
periodization of prophets you'll want to add this fourth category,
post-exilic prophets.</p>

<p>They urge the continuation of the building. A Persian official
objects, the Jews appeal to the new Persian Emperor Darius. And they
ask him to search through the court records, look for the original
authorization by Cyrus--we have been authorized to do this. According
to the text, Cyrus' edict is found. Darius agrees not only to enforce
it, but to honor his obligation to supply money for the rebuilding.
This is under Persian imperial sponsorship, and he will honor the
obligation to supply money for the rebuilding and to procure sacrifices
as well. The temple is finally dedicated, we think, about 515 BCE and a
Passover celebration is celebrated in the sanctuary.</p>

<p>There are other social tensions in the Restoration community,
specifically friction between those who had remained behind in Judea
during the exilic period and the returning exiles, who although they
were few in number, enjoyed imperial support.</p>

<p>These self-styled children of the exile, they refer to themselves as
sons of the exiled or children of the exile [and] they refer to the
local people--the local Judeans--as "peoples of the land." This is a
derogatory term that seems to cast aspersions on their very status as
Jews. They're like the <i>other</i> nations or peoples of the land.
They seem to be classifying even Judeans in that category of "other."
As we will soon see, some radically different views of Jewish identity
are going to emerge during this period.</p>

<p>So that's the initial Restoration, the process by which the temple
was rebuilt. Let's jump now to (we think) somewhere in the mid-fifth
century perhaps. Nehemiah--he's a Jewish subject of Persia--he's the
official cup bearer to the Persian Emperor Artaxerxes in the court at
Susa. This is a position that probably entailed his being a eunuch.</p>

<p>The Book of Nehemiah opens with a description of Nehemiah's grief.
He hears these reports of the terrible conditions of his people in
Jerusalem sometime around the mid-fifth century and, weeping, he asks
for the consent of the emperor to go to Jerusalem and to help rebuild
the city. So Nehemiah travels to Jerusalem, we think about 445 BCE, and
he undertakes the refortifications of the city. And he meets with
opposition. There's some internal opposition. There's a female
prophetess, Noadiah, in Nehemiah 6:14, who seems to be opposed to this.
There's some external opposition as well from Israel's neighbors: the
Samaritans, the Ammonites, some Arabs. They resent this reconstruction
and they see the reconstruction of the city's defensive walls as an
affront to Persian rule.</p>

<p>But Nehemiah continues; he gives his workmen weapons so that they
can protect themselves against enemy attack and the walls around the
city are completed in record time. These refortifications help to
establish Jerusalem as an urban center, and eventually Nehemiah is
appointed governor of Judah [Yehud], under Persian domination.</p>

<p>The text says that he institutes various reforms: economic reforms,
social reforms. He seems to be trying to improve the situation of the
poor, and establish public order. We think that the governorship of
Nehemiah overlapped to some degree with the mission of Ezra, and Ezra's
activities are reported in both the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Some
scholars believe that they didn't overlap, that that's an illusion
created by our sources.</p>

<p>But chapter 7 of the book of Ezra introduces Ezra. He's a Babylonian
Jew, he comes from a priestly family, but he's also described as a
scribe who is expert in the Torah of Moses. In verse 10 of chapter 7
it's said that Ezra had dedicated himself to study the teaching of the
Lord so as to observe it and to teach the laws and rules to Israel. So
Ezra is commissioned by the Persian Emperor in a letter, the text of
which is represented or reproduced in chapter 7:12-26. The Emperor
commissions him to travel to Jerusalem, to supervise the temple, and to
assess how well Mosaic standards are being implemented in the Judean
province. He's charged with appointing scribes and judges to administer
civil and moral order. He has the backing of the Persian empire to
institute Mosaic Law as the standard and norm for the community in
Jerusalem. This is standard operating procedure for the Persians--to
find loyal subjects to regulate their own local cults according to
ancestral traditions and Ezra's work needs to be understood in that
light.</p>

<p>Chapter 7:[14-26, selections]:</p>

<blockquote>"For you are commissioned by the king and his seven
advisors to regulate Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your
God, which is in your care,...And you, Ezra, by the divine wisdom you
possess, appoint magistrates and judges to judge all the people of the
province of Beyond the River" [Cis-Jordan] [See Note 1] "who know the
laws of your God, and to teach those who do not know them. Let anyone
who does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king be
punished with dispatch," [so he has powers of enforcement] "whether by
death, corporal punishment, confiscation of possessions, or
imprisonment."</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>In addition, Ezra is appointed to bring treasures of silver and gold
to the temple. The text says that Ezra brings with him a copy of the
Mosaic Torah in order to regulate and unify Jewish life in the
Restoration community, and together Ezra and Nehemiah bring about a
revival.</p>

<p>Ezra's reforms are aimed at strengthening the religious identity of
the Judahites. He wants to revitalize morale and he also wants to
prevent the decline of Mosaic standards and to prevent the decline of
biblical monotheism. His two most important acts are the dissolution of
foreign marriages (this is a first) and his renewal of the
covenant.</p>

<p>I'll say a little bit first about the dissolution of foreign
marriages. Ezra is said to have been distressed when he arrived to
discover that many of the returned exiles had married with, we think,
non-Israelite women. It's not clear. Sometimes "peoples of the land"
might refer to Judeans who had remained behind but who themselves had
perhaps become lax, in Ezra's eyes, in their observance of Mosaic
standards. But they had married women who seemed to follow pagan
practices perhaps.</p>

<p>Chapters 9 and 10 describe his efforts to reverse this trend. He
begs God to forgive the people for this violation of his law, and then
at a great assembly, he calls upon all the people to divorce their
foreign spouses. Now, this isn't in fact Pentateuchal law plainly read.
The prohibition of marriage with any foreigner is a great innovation on
Ezra's part, and it's one that, as we shall see, was not universally
accepted at all.</p>

<p>The high incidence of intermarriage is perhaps indicated by the fact
that it took several months to identify all those who had intermarried
and to send away their spouses and their children. Even priests were
among those who didn't view intermarriage per se as a violation of the
covenant. In the next two lectures we'll see other perspectives on this
question of integration of foreign groups within the community. So I
raise it as an issue now: we're going to see many different attitudes
as we move through the last section of the Bible.</p>

<p>The text of Ezra's prayer before God is a fascinating presentation
of Ezra's interpretation of Israel's history and prior texts, and
again, constitutes yet another response to the calamity that had
befallen the nation; but [it] also constitutes another example of
inner-biblical interpretation: later levels, or layers within the
biblical text turning to older traditions and interpreting them, or
reinterpreting them.</p>

<p>So listen to how Ezra understands biblical tradition and listen to
how he interprets Israel's history. This is from Ezra 9, he's praying
to God before the assembled people. [Vv. 7-12]</p>

<blockquote>From the time of our fathers to this very day we have been
deep in guilt. Because of our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests
have been handed over to foreign kings, to the sword, to captivity, to
pillage, and to humiliation, as is now the case. But now, for a short
while, there has been a reprieve from the Lord our God, who has granted
us a surviving remnant...</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>remember the prophetic idea of a remnant that would survive?</p>

<blockquote>...and given us a stake in His Holy place; our God has
restored the luster to our eyes and furnished us with a little
sustenance in our bondage… Now, what can we say in the face of this, O
our God, for we have forsaken Your commandments, which You gave us
through Your servants, the prophets when You said,</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>here he's quoting the Bible;</p>

<blockquote>'The land that you are about to possess is a land unclean
through the uncleanness of the peoples of the land, through their
abhorrent practices with which they, in their impurity, have filled it
from one end to the other. Now then, do not give your daughters in
marriage to their sons or let their daughters marry your sons; do
nothing for their well being or advantage, then you will be strong and
enjoy the bounty of the land and bequeath it to your children
forever.'</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So he's quoting earlier tradition.</p>

<blockquote>After all that has happened to us because of our evil deeds
and our deep guilt--though You, our God, have been forbearing,
[punishing us] less than our iniquity [deserves] in that You have
granted us such a remnant as this-- shall we once again violate Your
commandments by intermarrying with these people who follow such
abhorrent practices? Will You not rage against us till we are destroyed
without remnant or survivor?</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So Ezra's argument is, first of all, following the Deuteronomistic
line. History reflects God's judgment. Israel's tragic fate is because
of her sins, and indeed, she's been given a mercy and a reprieve. She
hasn't been punished as fully as she deserves. He also follows the
prophetic line that this remnant has been saved and now restored. So
the covenant hasn't been completely abrogated. But notice his
identification of the sin for which Israel was punished. Israel has
mixed--and this is the language that he uses elsewhere--Israel has
mixed holy seed with common seed through marital unions with the
peoples of the land, meaning foreigners certainly, but possibly also
some of these Judeans who had remained in the land during the exile and
who seem to have adopted some of the customs of their neighbors. And if
history is any guide, he's warning, the community is placing itself at
great risk by intermarrying again with those who will lead them into
the worship of other gods and the performance of abhorrent
practices.</p>

<p>Surely he says, this time God will not be so merciful as to spare
even a remnant. So learn from history. We sinned once by intermarrying,
that was the sin for which we have been exiled. If we do the same thing
again, this time we will be punished without any hope of a remnant.</p>

<p>So his interpretation of Mosaic prescriptions about marriage is an
expansive one. The Torah does prohibit intermarriage with the native
Canaanites at the time of the conquest, the rationale being that they
would lead Israelites into abhorrent pagan practices, child sacrifices,
and so on. But of course it's actually not a completely--there is
actually a legal provision for how to go about marrying a captive
Canaanite woman; so it's not a completely unqualified prohibition to
begin with.</p>

<p>The Torah then also prohibits intermarriage with certain, very
specific foreigners, Moabites and Ammonites, specifically because of
their cruel treatment of the Israelites during their trek from Egypt to
the Promised Land.</p>

<p>Egyptians are prohibited only to the third generation. But there's
no prohibition against marriage with other foreigners--a Phoenician, an
Arab--so long as they enter into the covenant of Yahweh, as long as
they don't lead the Israelite partner into the worship of other gods.
The rationale for intermarriage prohibitions in the Pentateuch are
always behavioral, they're always moral. If this person will lead you
astray to abhorrent practices that is prohibited. But marriage
<i>into</i> the group is not prohibited.</p>

<p>Indeed, Israel's kings married foreign women regularly. Many of the
kings of Israel were themselves offspring of these foreign women. They
were still fully Israelite. Israelite identity passed through the male
line. But Ezra who is protective of Israel's religious identity, is
zealous for the Lord, is wary of God's wrath--he's interpreting and
promulgating these prohibitions in such a way as to create a general
ban on intermarriage of any kind. Israel mustn't make the same mistake
twice. Israelite identity is now made contingent in Ezra's view on the
status of both the mother and the father. One is only an Israelite if
one has both an Israelite mother and an Israelite father. Both must be
of the "holy seed." This is a phrase [holy seed] which is being coined
now in Ezra's time and is now serving as a rationale for the ban on
intermarriage. It's not that a person is prohibited because they will
lead you astray to the worship of other gods. That's something that can
be corrected if the person in fact enters into the religious community
of Israel. The rationale is that they just simply are not of holy seed
and there's nothing that you can do to change that, so this becomes a
permanent and universal ban.</p>

<p>So that's the first very important thing that Ezra tries to do: the
dissolution of marriage with foreign spouses and to establish a blanket
universal ban on intermarriage, to make Israelite identity dependent on
the native Israelite status of both mother and father.</p>

<p>His second deed is the renewal of the Mosaic Covenant. This act is
reported in Nehemiah 8[:1-8]. There's an extended public reading of the
Torah of Moses and that's followed then by a renewal of the Mosaic
Covenant:</p>

<blockquote>When the seventh month arrived--the Israelites being
[settled] in their towns--the entire people assembled as one man in the
square before the Water Gate, and they asked Ezra the scribe to bring
the scroll of the Teaching of Moses with which the Lord had charged
Israel. On the first day of the seventh month, Ezra the priest brought
the Teaching before the congregation, men and women and all who could
listen with understanding. He read from it, facing the square before
the Water Gate, from the first light until midday, to the men and the
women and those who could understand; the ears of all the people were
given to the scroll of the Teaching.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>[the word here is Torah]</p>

<p>Ezra the scribe stood upon a wooden tower made for the purpose…Ezra
opened the scroll in the sight of all the people, for he was above all
the people; as he opened it, all the people stood up. Ezra blessed the
Lord, the great God and all the people answered, "Amen, Amen," with
hands upraised…[The leaders] and the Levites explained the Teaching to
the people, while the people stood in their places. They read from the
scroll of the teaching of God, translating it and giving the sense; so
they understood the reading.</p>

<p>Apparently the assembled people no longer understood the classical
Hebrew of the Bible, if it was formulated in that. What he was
actually--what is this scroll? This is the first time now that we're
hearing about the Torah as a scroll and being read to people. So this
is historically quite fascinating. But the people don't seem to be able
to understand it. Ezra and his assistants are probably translating it
into Aramaic which is now the <i>lingua franca</i> of the Persian
Empire, giving the sense of the text perhaps as it's being read. We
really can't be certain what it is that Ezra was presenting as the
Torah of Moses. It may have been the Pentateuch basically in the form
that we now have it. Both D and P are very strongly reflected in Ezra.
He quotes from them, he refers to them, and then interprets and applies
them in new and interesting ways.</p>

<p>In any event, this Torah was to become the basis and the
standard--with a lot of good heavy Persian imperial support--for the
Jewish community from that time forward. And at a festival celebration
a few weeks later there was an additional public teaching of the law
and a recital of Israel's history that once again laid special emphasis
on Israel's obligations, what she owed to Yahweh.</p>

<p>The recitation of that history is found in Nehemiah 9, and again as
an interpretation of the calamities that Israel had faced; it's
consistent with the earlier prayer of Ezra that I read. God has
withheld nothing from Israel, yet Israel has defied God, rebelled
against Him, killed the prophets who had urged them to turn back to the
covenant; and God tolerated Israel's sin as long as he possibly could
but finally he had to punish her. But even so, in His great compassion
God didn't abandon Israel completely.</p>

<p>Verse 33 of this prayer then turns and addresses God, "Surely you
are in the right with respect to all that has come upon us, for You
have acted faithfully and we have been wicked." So again, [we see] this
justification of God and blaming of the Israelites for all that has
befallen them and learning a lesson for that in the future--no
intermarriage.</p>

<p>All of this is but a prelude then to the people's reaffirmation and
renewed commitment to the covenant, and it's spelled out in great
detail in Nehemiah 10. Chapter 10 opens, "In view of all this, we make
this pledge and put it in writing," and then there follows a list of
all the officials: the Levites, the priests, the heads of the people.
And it says that all of these officials and leaders in conjunction join
with the people, verse 30 and 31, they:</p>

<blockquote>… join with their noble brothers, and take an oath with
sanctions to follow the Teaching of God, given through Moses the
servant of God, and to observe carefully all the commandments of the
Lord our Lord, His rules and laws. Namely: We will not give our
daughters in marriage to the peoples of the land or take their
daughters for our sons.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So we then read the various obligations that the people are
committing themselves to, and these include observance of the Sabbath
day and the Sabbath year as well as supplying the needs of and the
upkeep of the temple. But it's surely significant that the ban on
intermarriage and the observance of the Sabbath top the list. We are
going to commit ourselves again to God's teaching, his rules and laws;
namely: we won't intermarry and we'll observe the Sabbath! So these are
singled out at the top of the list, as central covenantal
obligations.</p>

<p>Chapter 13 describes Nehemiah's efforts to see that the people live
up to this pledge. And he scurries around Jerusalem--he's enforcing the
cessation of work on the Sabbath, he's persuading individuals to give
up their foreign wives.</p>

<p>Ezra and Nehemiah were zealous in their promotion of the renewed
covenant, and in their view, the centerpiece of the covenant was the
ban on intermarriage and the observance of the Sabbath. It is
interesting that these two phenomena, in addition to circumcision, will
emerge as the three identifying features of a Jew in the ancient world
when you look at external literature: they are a circumcised people,
there's one day of the week that they don't work, and they don't marry
outside their group. Those are the kinds of themes that you start to
see in writings of ancient Greeks and so on when they talk about this
people.</p>

<p>Ezra and Nehemiah's reforms can be seen as a direct response to the
events of Israel's history. What's happened before just cannot be
allowed to happen again. And they view the tragic history as a
cautionary tale. It's calling upon the people to make the necessary
changes to avoid a repeat disaster. There's only one way to guarantee
that Israel will never again be destroyed. She has to live up to the
covenant she failed to honor in the past. She has to rededicate herself
to the covenant and this time she has to be single-minded in her
devotion to God, because history has shown that God will punish
faithlessness and betrayal. Israel can't be led astray by the beliefs
and practices of her neighbors, and so a strict policy of separation
has to be enforced if Israel's going to finally be cured of the desire
for idols.</p>

<p>Again, it's interesting that in Jewish tradition--the Jewish
tradition is that the flirtation with idolatry, which had plagued
Israel in the First Temple Period, ceased to exist in the Second Temple
Period. So again, this is another area in which Jews earned for
themselves a reputation in antiquity. They have a reputation for their
strict monotheism, their scrupulous avoidance of foreign gods. They
will not bow down to another god. There is this people that doesn't
intermarry, they don't work one day a week, and they won't bow down to
our kings or to other gods; these are the kinds of things
[observations] you find in writings in this period.</p>

<p>So Ezra and Nehemiah, backed by Persian imperial authority, help to
create and preserve--not just preserve--<i>create</i> and preserve, a
national and religious identity for Jews at a precarious time. Their
reforms were not universally welcomed. Already, even in the books of
Ezra and Nehemiah which give a very sympathetic account of their work,
obviously, we can see rumblings and discontent.</p>

<p>There are other works that are going to express opposition to the
separatism of Ezra and Nehemiah. Isaiah 56:1-7, an interesting passage,
it states quite explicitly that foreigners who have joined themselves
to God are welcome. They are welcome in the temple; they are welcome
even to minister before God. There is a good deal of historical
evidence for the assimilation of foreigners within the Jewish community
going on all the time. Non-Jews became Jews, they married Jews. We know
of one family, the Tobiad family, quite influential--they were
originally an Ammonite family. Now, that is a group that is explicitly
prohibited from entering the congregation in Deuteronomy! But this is a
family that adopted Jewish identity, became fully assimilated. So
clearly there's great difference of opinion on this matter. In the last
two lectures we're going to be focusing a lot on the diversity of
approaches to the whole question of Israelite or Jewish identity, and
the relationship to the Gentile world.</p>

<p>So, although under Ezra, the Torah became the official and
authoritative norm for Israel, although under Ezra Judaism took the
decisive step towards becoming a religion of Scripture, based on the
scriptural text. This did not in itself result in a single uniform set
of practices or beliefs. Adopting the Torah as a communal norm simply
meant that practices and beliefs were deemed to be authentic, to the
degree that they accorded with the sense of Scripture--and
interpretation of Scripture varied dramatically. So that widely
divergent groups now, in the Persian period and as we move into the
Hellenistic period, widely divergent groups will claim biblical warrant
for their specific practices and beliefs.</p>

<p>So in short, Ezra may have unified Israel around a common text, but
he didn't unify them around a common <i>interpretation</i> of that
text.</p>

<p>Alright, when we come back we'll be looking at about four more
books, all of which set up very interesting and different views on some
of these basic questions.</p>
