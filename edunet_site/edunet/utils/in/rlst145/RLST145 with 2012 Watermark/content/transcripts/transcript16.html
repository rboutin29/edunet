<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> Let me just briefly recap as we
are moving into the literary prophets, or the classical prophets, they
are sometimes called. It is easiest to think of them as being
associated with particular crises in the nation's history. We are not
going to be looking at them all, and I have picked out some of the main
ones that we will be looking at. Really, they are exemplary in a number
of different ways.</p>

<p>So you have prophets of the Assyrian crisis. This is when the two
kingdoms still exist. In the north prophesying in Israel, you have Amos
and Hosea. And in the south you have Isaiah and Micah. So think of
those four books together. It will be easier to note the differences
among them if you group them together. And we will be doing that.</p>

<p>Then the prophets of the Babylonian crisis. By this time the
northern kingdom has fallen. We are moving towards the end of the
seventh century. The Assyrian Empire has fallen in 612. The prophet
Nahum talks about the fall of Assyria. And we move then into the very
end of the century and down to the beginning of the sixth century, with
the destruction of Judah. So prophets associated with that time:
particularly Jeremiah, and also Habakkuk. Then we have the prophet of
the exile, who is Ezekiel. And then the post-exilic period, or the
Restoration, when the Israelites are allowed to return to their land
and we have several prophets at that time: Haggai, Zechariah, Joel and
Malachi will be the prophets we'll be looking at briefly.</p>

<p>There are three long prophetic works, and I have circled those [on
the blackboard]: Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, one associated with each
of the three crises. So again another mnemonic for you is to think of
them each associated with each of those major crises. And the rest are
all much shorter works, I think Obadiah being the shortest, really just
a very, very short work. There has been a long debate over the degree
to which these classical or literary prophets were harking back to long
standing Israelite traditions or constructing norms that would later
come to be viewed as long standing Israelite traditions. Kaufman
describes these classical prophets as the standard bearers of the
covenant [Kaufman 1972, Part III]. This is his term. And in his view
they could be seen as conservatives, but by the same token he says the
new prophecy conceived of ideas that Israelite thought of the earlier
time had not conceived. And in this sense, Kaufman argues they are also
radical. He describes them as radical conservatives or conservative
radicals. As a result of the radical nature of some of their message,
the prophets had to speak with great exaggeration. And you will notice
this when you read their writing. Great exaggeration, a lot of dramatic
imagery, dramatic features. They denounce the people. They chastise the
people. And as a result they were often scoffed at or even persecuted
in return.</p>

<p>But eventually the nation would come to enshrine their words in its
ancient sacred heritage, which is testimony to the fact that their
message must have served a crucial role at some time in the changing
political and religious reality.</p>

<p>Now, we have already talked about the Deuteronomistic historiosophy,
and how it developed as an interpretation of the historical
catastrophes of 722 and 586, and this interpretation made it possible
for Israelites to accept the reality of the defeat of the nation, the
defeat of Israel, without at the same time losing faith in God. The
defeat of Israel, the exile of the nation, was not to be taken as
evidence that God was not the one supreme Lord of history, or that God
was a faithless God, who would abandon his covenant and his people. The
defeat and the exile were interpreted to affirm precisely the opposite.
God, as the universal God, could use other nations as his tool. He
could use these nations to execute judgment on his people, and he did
this in an act of faithfulness ultimately, faithful to his covenant,
which promised punishment and chastisement for the sins of the people,
the sins of idolatry.</p>

<p>The classical literary prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the
12 minor prophets, follow the basic thrust of this interpretation of
events. They agree that the defeat and the exile are evidence rather
than disproof of God's universal sovereignty, and they agree that they
are God's just punishment for sin. But they are going to differ from
the Deuteronomist in two significant ways. First they are going to
differ in their identification of that sin. For the prophets, it is not
just idolatry for which Israel is punished, although that is important,
too. And second of all, they are going to differ in their emphasis on a
future restoration and glory, a message that we do not find in the
Deuteronomistic historian.</p>

<p>The individual books of the prophets are really arranged according
to two interacting principles: size and chronology. So you have the
first three books, [they] are the very large, prophetic books: Isaiah,
Jeremiah, and Ezekiel in chronological order of the three crises we
have outlined here. And then you have the minor prophets, and the minor
prophets, again, are roughly chronological order, although book size
also plays a bit of a role in arranging these materials. That was very
common in the ancient world--for size to determine the order of books
in a corpus. We are not going to be following the order of the canon,
because it does jump around chronologically; first with the three large
books and then going back and having some of the smaller books of
earlier prophets. We are going to be looking at them in chronological
order. We are going to be looking at them against the backdrop of the
historical crisis to which they are responding.</p>

<p>So we are going to begin with the first of the literary prophets,
even though it is not the first in the order of the Bible, and that is
Amos. Amos preached during a relatively stable period of time. This was
in the northern kingdom. It was around 750 under the reign of Jeroboam
the Second, not the first. And this is at a time before the Assyrian
threat is becoming very apparent, and Assyria's empire building
ambitions--before those are becoming very apparent. There are many
passages that suggest that Amos was an ordinary shepherd. He came from
a small town about 10 miles south of Jerusalem; so he came from the
southern kingdom to prophesy in the northern kingdom. He was called to
Bethel, which was one of the royal sanctuaries in the northern kingdom,
to deliver his prophecies. But despite the suggestion that he was an
ordinary shepherd it seems more likely that he was probably a fairly
wealthy owner of land and flocks. He was probably educated and
literate. The northerners are said to be very surprised by his
eloquence and his intelligence. But they did not like his message, and
ultimately he is going to be forced to go back to the southern
kingdom.</p>

<p>The Book of Amos can be divided structurally into four sections,
which I have listed on the board over here. You first have a set of
brief oracles of doom. These are in the first two chapters, Amos 1 and
2. And then you have a series of three short oracles, oracles to the
women of Samaria, an oracle to the wealthy of Samaria and Jerusalem,
and then an oracle to Israel as a whole. These are in chapters 3-6.
This is followed then by five symbolic visions which receive
interpretation. These are visions of judgment, first locusts, then a
fire, then a plumb line that one uses in building a building, a basket
of fruit, and then a vision of God standing by the altar at Bethel.
This happens [in] chapters 7-9, about verse 8 and 9 [of chapter 7 for
the plumb line version]. This section, besides the five visions, also
has a little narrative account of Amos' conflict with a priest at
Bethel, the priest Amaziah who accuses Amos of treason. And then there
is a concluding epilogue in the ninth chapter that runs for about seven
or eight verses to the end of the book.</p>

<p>The Book of Amos is a wonderful place to start for us because it
contains many features that are going to be typical of all of the
classical prophets, all of the literary prophets by and large. And also
this book introduces certain major themes. These will become standard
themes of prophecy with some variation here and there. So by setting
them out in the Book of Amos then we can really go forward and just
look at the variations on some of those themes that are sounded by some
of the other prophets.</p>

<p>So first some literary features, and then we will talk about the
themes of the book. In terms of literary features, I have jotted down a
few here. You see in the book what we would call editorial notes. That
is to say, you have notes in the Book of Amos which are in the third
person. These will very often occur at the beginning of a book. They
sort of introduce or set the stage. So we have in Amos. "The words of
Amos, a sheep breeder from Tekoa, who prophesied concerning Israel in
the reigns of kings Uzziah of Judah and Jeroboam, the son of Joash of
Israel, two years before the earthquake." So almost all of the
prophetic books are going to contain an introduction of this type. Some
third-person phrase which will identify the place and the prophet and
his time. There is another kind of writing in some of these works, as
well, which is in the first person. It is not always in the third
person, but you sometimes have first person passages in which the
prophet himself will speak about and describe something about himself.
It's a stepping aside from the oracular moment and speaking in some way
about some experience that he has had. So we have these first person
and these third person passages that give us information about the
prophet.</p>

<p>The third-person passages, we surmise, may have been written by the
prophet, but they were probably written by disciples or others who were
responsible for collecting the prophets' oracles, inditing the
prophet's oracles. Amos 7 is an example of this. In Amos 7, we find an
example of this kind of writing, again, where you have a description of
Amos in debate with a priest, Priest Amaziah, at the Shrine of Bethel.
So you have the oracular statements, but you also have these other
identifying passages as well, and descriptive passages.</p>

<p>This brings us then to a second point, which is that the prophetic
books are a compilation of a variety of materials. They consist of
varied materials that have been collected. They have been revised. They
have been supplemented. The prophets' oracles, which were delivered in
various situations over a period of time, were apparently saved and
then compiled, again perhaps by the prophet himself, perhaps by his
disciples. We know that prophetic oracles were written down and
transmitted in other ancient Near Eastern societies. We know this about
Assyria, for example. These were literary compositions and the literary
nature of these compositions will account sometimes for their ordering.
Sometimes it appears that there is not chronological ordering. This is
one of the things that can make it so hard to read some of the
prophetic writings, because the oracles are not necessarily in
chronological order. They are literary works, and sometimes the prophet
or the disciple or the editor would combine principles--I'm sorry,
combine oracles or juxtapose oracles according to principles other than
chronology--literary principles. So for example, you very often find
the principle of a catch word: a prophecy or oracle that might end with
a particular word in its last line or last verse, and so next to it
will be a second prophecy or oracle which echoes that word in its
opening line, and so the two have been brought together for literary
reasons. So Amos 3:2, reads: "You alone have I known of all the
families of the earth." And that is the concluding line of that
particular oracle, and that verb "to know" is probably the catchword
for the oracle that follows, because the next one opens, "Do two people
walk together unless they know each other?" So that may have suggested
the juxtaposition of those two.</p>

<p>So we need to understand that the prophetic books are really little
anthologies, anthologies of oracles. They can be connected for literary
rather than substantive or chronological reasons. You can't assume
chronological sequence. It is not like reading the historical books of
Joshua through 2 Kings. It is very, very different.</p>

<p>An interesting question concerns the degree to which the prophetic
books preserve the actual oracles of the prophets. Certainly there is
no doubt that there has been revision and supplementation of the
prophetic books. Not everything in the Book of Amos is from Amos,
himself. Additions have been made to most of the prophetic books. It
was believed that the words of the prophets had enduring significance.
Those who received these words believed that they had enduring
significance. And so they were supplemented because of the conviction
that they had enduring relevance, not despite of it, because of it. And
some scholars believe that this accounts for the oracle in Amos 2 that
prophesies the fall of Judah. Amos is living in 750, the latter half of
the eighth century, not in the sixth century. He is living in the
eighth century. But he prophesies the fall of Judah, and most people
would assume that this is an addition which is made to the Book of Amos
after Judah's fall. These supplementations and additions and revisions
that we will see in some of the prophetic books, and some of them are
quite obvious, were not completely promiscuous. I don't want to give
you the idea that they were, because there are many instances in which
a prophet's words are not updated, are not modified, even though the
failure to do this leaves the prophecy woefully out of step with what
actually came to be later. So those kinds of inconsistencies between a
prophet's words and later fact would suggest that there was a strong
tendency to preserve the words of the prophet faithfully. So we will
see both tendencies within the literature, a tendency to leave words
intact, and at the same place [correction: time], a tendency to
supplement or to add sections to the prophet, the prophetic
writing.</p>

<p>A third feature that we will see in many of the prophetic books is
what we call "the call." And this is common to most of the prophets. It
is the claim to authority as a result of having been called by God to
deliver his word. We talked before about apostolic prophecy, this
notion of the prophet as someone who is sent by God with a message, not
someone who is consulted by a client to find out what God thinks. The
irresistibility of the call is a feature of these passages, and we find
it illustrated in Amos 3:7-8, after citing a series of proverbs that
illustrate inexorable cause and effect. For example, he says, "Does a
trap spring up from the ground/Unless it has caught something?" And
then the oracle continues, "A lion has roared,/Who can but fear?/My
Lord God has spoken,/Who can but prophesy?" There is this irresistible
call. We find metaphors used liberally throughout the prophetic
writings. And Amos describes his prophecy by means of two types of
metaphors, word and vision. So many of the prophetic oracles will be
introduced by the phrase "the word of Yahweh came unto prophet X." The
word of Yahweh came--sort of an image of God speaking directly to these
prophets in human language, which is then repeated or passed on to the
audience, to the listener.</p>

<p>This could be understood in a literal sense. We could take this as a
metaphor. Behind it, however, is the simple idea that it is God who is
communicating to the prophet and the prophet then communicates the
message to the people. But in addition to hearing, Amos and many of the
other prophets also see. So the word of the Lord comes, but in other
moments the prophetic oracle will be introduced by verbs or words
connected with seeing and vision. Hence the word "seer" as a
designation for a prophet also.</p>

<p>Amos is shown visions of various kinds, particularly those five
visions clumped in chapters 7, 8 and 9. And this is true of the
prophets generally. These visions might be visions of God speaking, or
visions of God performing some kind of action. They might also be
visions of perfectly ordinary objects or events that carry some sort of
symbolic significance. So we have five visions in Amos in chapters 7-9,
and some of them are visions of ordinary objects, but those objects
have some special coded meaning or symbolic significance for Israel.
And then we have visions of extraordinary things, as well. So we have a
locust plague. It is about to consume the crop right after the king has
taken his share, his taxes of the crop. Not such an extraordinary
vision, but then there is a vision of a fire that consumes the lower
waters that are pressed down below the earth, and which threatens to
consume even the soil of the earth itself. So it is an extraordinary
vision. We have a vision of a plumb line-- the tool that is used by
builders. There is a vision of God destroying worshipers in the temple.
The vision in chapter 8 is an ordinary vision. It is a vision of a
basket of summer fruit. The Hebrew word for summer or summer fruit is
<i>kayits</i> and this is a pun because the word <i>kets</i> means end.
So the vision of <i>kayits</i> is indicating or symbolizing the
<i>kets</i>, the end of Israel. And these kinds of symbolic visions
will very often typically include puns of this type.</p>

<p>So another point to make about just the literary features of
prophetic writings is that they do contain or employ a variety of
literary forms. One commonplace form that you will see over and over
again in these writings is a form that we call the oracle, an oracle
against the nations. This is found in Amos. It's found also in the
three large prophetic writings: Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Amos 1
and 2 contains seven of these oracles that inveigh against the nations.
But Amos gives the form a new twist. And this is what's interesting.
Six of the seven oracles are directed against surrounding nations, and
they are excoriated for their inhumane treatment of others, Israelites
and non-Israelites during wars and conflicts, as punishment for their
terrible war atrocities. A divine fire is going to break out and
destroy all of their palaces and fortified places. But then the twist
comes, because after these six horrific oracles, which condemn the
nations for these brutal acts of atrocity in war, Amos then turns to
address his own people. And he says the same divine power will consume
the people of Yahweh because of the atrocities and inhumanities that
they commit even in times of peace!</p>

<p>So the seventh, the climactic oracle, announces that God's wrath
will be directed at Israel, and this is a very unwelcome, unexpected
statement. And you can see how he perhaps would almost draw his
audience in, you know, with these images of their enemies getting what
they deserve, only to then turn it around (having drawn them in,
seduced them if you will with his words)--to turn around and then
charge <i>them</i> with something even worse.</p>

<p>The term "Israel" that he uses is, of course, ambiguous. That is one
of the problems with some of the prophetic writings. You are never
completely sure whether they're prophesying against the northern
kingdom, Israel, or the House of Israel--both kingdoms together, the
whole tribal confederation. Some passages in Amos would suggest one.
Some passages suggest the other. The other thing that we find in Amos
is an oracle against Judah, against the southern kingdom. This is in
chapter 2. It is just two lines, verses 4 and 5, and it is in chapter
2. And many people identify that as a later addition by an editor.
First of all, it's written in very standard, sort of Deuteronomistic
language. And also, if we leave it out, then we have a nice literary
pattern. We have six oracles plus one. We have six oracles against
foreign nations, and then we have one against Israel. And that pattern
is a very standard, literary pattern, particularly in poetic sections
of the Bible and the prophets are written in an elevated poetic style.
We very often have a six plus one pattern. That's related to another
pattern that we also see in Amos, which is the three plus one pattern.
This is just a doubling of it, six plus one. The three plus one pattern
you will recognize. It is quite explicit at times. Amos will say, "for
three transgressions of Damascus, for four, I will not revoke it"--the
decree, the punishment. A similar kind of language is used in verse 6
for Gaza, in verse 9 for Tyre, in verse 11 for Edom, and verse 13 for
the Ammonites, and so on. So we often have this pattern. And so the
suggestion by scholars is that without that prophecy concerning the
fall of Judah, which post-dates Amos, you would have a nice complete
six plus one pattern. And this might be the sign of a later editor
updating Amos' prophecy, so that it would look as though he had, in
fact, prophesied the fall of Judah.</p>

<p>You have other sorts of literary patterns and forms used in the
prophetic works. Some of the literary forms we see are hymns. We see
songs. We see laments, particularly laments or mourning for Israel as
if her destruction is already a <i>fait accompli</i>. You find
proverbs. Very often when the prophets cite a proverb, they will turn
its accepted meaning on its head. They'll take an old proverb and
they'll apply it to some new situation and give it a radically new kind
of meaning, to sort of shock and surprise their audience. And Amos 3-8
contains a lot of proverbs.</p>

<p>Another literary form that we will see, and this is an important
one, is a literary form that is called the <i>riv</i>, r-i -v. I have
it up there [on the blackboard]: a <i>riv</i>, which basically means a
lawsuit, specifically a covenant lawsuit. Many of the prophetic books
feature passages in which God basically brings a lawsuit against the
people, charging them with breach of covenant, breach of contract, if
you will. And in these passages, you have legal metaphors being used
throughout: people testifying or witnessing against Israel--can she
speak in her [own] defense?--and so on. So the <i>riv</i>, or the
covenant lawsuit is a form we will see here. We will also see it again
when we get to the Book of Job. So the prophetic corpus draws on the
entire range of literary forms that were available in Israelite
literary tradition, and very often gives them a rich--and that is what
give the books a very rich and varied texture.</p>

<p>So Amos is a model for us in terms of its literary features, but
it's also a model for us in terms of some of the themes or the content
of the book--because Amos will articulate certain themes that we will
see resounding throughout the prophetic literature. There will be some
variations on these themes, but some standard themes appear here. So we
will review those now.</p>

<p>Many scholars, Kaufman among them, have noted that the literature of
the classical prophets is most clearly and strongly characterized by a
vehement denunciation of the moral decay and social injustice of the
period. It really does not matter what period. "Vehement denunciation"
of moral decay and social injustice, is the way the Kaufman phrases it
[Kaufman 1972, 347]. Amos criticizes the sins of the nation. He is
critical of everyone, the middle class, the government, the king, the
establishment, the priesthood--they're all plagued by a superficial
kind of piety. For Amos, as for all the prophets we will be looking at,
the idea of covenant prescribes a particular relationship with Yahweh,
but not only with Yahweh: also with one's fellow human beings. The two
are interlinked. It is a sign of closeness to Yahweh that one is
concerned for Israel's poor and needy. The two are completely
intertwined and interlinked. And so Amos denounces the wealthy. He
denounces the powerful and the way they treat the poor. I am going to
be reading some passages from Amos to illustrate some of these
themes.</p>

<p>So Amos 4:1-3--and listen to the dramatic rhetoric that is used:
"Hear this word, you cows of Bashan/On the hill of Samaria"--that is
the capital of the northern kingdom, Israel:</p>

<blockquote>Who defraud the poor,<br />
Who rob the needy;<br />
Who say to your husbands,<br />
"Bring, and let's carouse!"<br />
My Lord God swears by His holiness:<br />
Behold, days are coming upon you<br />
When you will be carried off in baskets,<br />
And, to the last one, in fish baskets,<br />
And taken out [of the city]--<br />
Each one through a breach straight ahead--<br />
And flung on the refuse heap.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It's a wonderful pun here, because the wealthy women of Samaria are
referred to as cows of Bashan. Now Bashan is an area that is very rich
pastureland in the transJordan. And also it is very common in Canaanite
literature to refer to the nobility, and even to gods, with terms like
bull or ram or cow. These were not insulting terms, as they might be in
our culture. These were, in fact, terms that did not offend. These were
very complimentary terms. So when he refers to the cows of Bashan (he
speaks to the women of Samaria as the cows of Bashan) he is flattering
them to begin with. But the pun is quite wonderful because these women
are going to end up like fat cows, as slabs of meat in the butcher's
basket or in the fish basket which, you know, is flung out on the
refuse heap once it is spoiled. So he takes that term "cows of Bashan,"
and leads it to this horrendous end.</p>

<p>Amos 6:1 and 4-7. This is another scathing attack on the idle life
of the carefree rich who ignore the plight of the poor: woe to those
"at ease in Zion." Of course, that is the capital of the southern
kingdom, Jerusalem, and those "confident on the hill of Samaria," the
northern kingdom:</p>

<blockquote>You notables of the leading nation<br />
On whom the House of Israel pin their hopes;<br />
[…]<br />
They lie on ivory beds,<br />
Lolling on their couches,<br />
Feasting on lambs from the flock<br />
And on calves from the stalls.<br />
They hum snatches of song to the tune of the lute--<br />
They account themselves musicians like David.<br />
They drink [straight] from the wine bowls<br />
And anoint themselves with the choicest oils--<br />
But they are not concerned about the ruin of Joseph.<br />
Assuredly, right soon<br />
They shall head the column of exiles;<br />
They shall lull no more at festive meals.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It is a great image of them lying about as the head of the nation.
They will be at the head of the nation as it moves into exile! And on
an archaeological note, I understand that in Samaria they have, in
fact, uncovered all kinds of ivory furniture and ivory coverings that
would then be attached to furniture. So the image of them lolling on
ivory couches in Samaria apparently makes a lot of sense. So the moral
decay, the greed, the indulgence of the upper classes, this is directly
responsible for the social injustice that according to the prophets
outrages God. Amos 8:4-6:</p>

<blockquote>Listen to this, you who devour the needy, annihilating the
poor of the land, saying, "If only the new moon were over, so that we
could sell grain; the sabbath, so that we could offer wheat for sale,
using [a measure] that is too small and a shekel [weight] that is too
big, tilting a dishonest scale, and selling grain refuse as grain! We
will buy the poor for silver, the needy for a pair of sandals. The Lord
swears by the pride of Jacob: I will never forget any of [their]
doings. [See note 1]</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Again, notice that they are prone to extreme formulations and
high-flown rhetoric, and sometimes when you strip away the rhetoric,
you see that the crimes that are being denounced are not murder, and
rape, or horrendous physical violence. These [the latter] are obvious
and grievous violations of social morality. Rather many scholars have
pointed out, I think Kaufman chief among them, that the crimes that are
denounced here are crimes that are prevalent in any society in any era.
The crimes that are denounced as being utterly unacceptable to God,
infuriating God to the point of destruction of the nation, are the
kinds of crimes we see around us everyday, taking bribes, improper
weights and balances, lack of charity to the poor, indifference to the
plight of the debtor.</p>

<p>A second theme that is pointed out again by many scholars, is what
Kaufman calls the idea of the primacy of morality [Kaufman 1972, 345].
That is to say the idea or the doctrine that morality is not just an
obligation equal in importance to the cultic or religious obligations,
but that morality is perhaps superior to the cult. What God requires of
Israel is morality and not cultic service. Now, the prophets are all
going to have--we are going to see many different attitudes towards the
cult among the prophets. So allow that to become a more nuanced
statement as we go through. Some are going to reject the cult of the
entire nation. Others will not. So there is going to be some variation,
but certainly morality is primary. And their words could, at times, be
very harsh and very astonishing. Amos 5:21-24. "I loathe"--he is
speaking now as God, right? So God is speaking--God says:</p>

<blockquote>"I loathe, I spurn your festivals,<br />
I am not appeased by your solemn assemblies.<br />
If you offer Me burnt [sacrifices] or your meal [sacrifices]<br />
I will not accept them;<br />
I will pay no heed<br />
To your gifts of fatlings.<br />
Spare me the sound of your hymns,<br />
And let Me not hear the music of your lutes.<br />
But let justice well up like water,<br />
Righteousness like an unfailing stream." [See note 2]</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>This is an attack on empty piety, on the performance of rituals
without any meaning, perhaps, behind that performance, or in
accompaniment to social injustice--the two can't happen at the same
time. And that's a theme that is sounded repeatedly throughout
prophetic literature. So for Amos, and for all the prophets, injustice
is sacrilege. The ideals of the covenant are of utmost importance. That
is why they are called the standard bearers of the covenant, harking
back to the covenant obligations. And without these, without the ideals
of the covenant, the fulfillment of cultic and ritual obligations in
and of itself is a farce. That is not to say that they would be
rejected were Israel to be upholding the covenant.</p>

<p>So this rejection of the cult depends, of course, on a caricature of
cultic and ritual performance. The prophets caricature it as
meaningless. They caricature it as unconcerned with ethics or with the
ideals of justice and righteousness. But internal cultural conflicts
often do involve the caricaturing or the ridiculing of an opponent's
beliefs or practices. But for some of the prophets rejection of the
cult was quite radical. That is an idea that is not yet really fully
formed in Amos. We are going to see, again, that some of the prophets
will reject the cult of the nation, not just the cult of the wicked,
but everyone. Even if performed properly and by righteous persons,
there will be one or two prophets who believe the cult has no inherent
value or no absolute value for God.</p>

<p>In some sense, this is a view that we have already encountered in
sources devoted to the cult even in a source like P, the Priestly
material. The Priestly material is already moving towards the idea, or
establishing the idea, that the cult is an expression of divine favor
rather than divine need. It doesn't really have an actual value
necessarily for God. It doesn't really affect his vitality. It is given
to humans as a ritual conduit, as a way to attract and maintain God's
presence within the community, or to procure atonement for deeds or
impurities that might temporarily separate one from God. So already in
the Priestly source, we have a very complicated notion of the function
of the [cult] for society and humanity. So the prophetic doctrine of
the primacy of morality seems to be a reaction against other views of
cultic practice; perhaps there were popular assumptions about the
automatic efficacy of the cult and its rites.</p>

<p>But Kaufman has been joined by many other scholars who argue that
the prophets raised morality to the level of an absolute religious
value, and they did so because they saw morality as essentially divine
[Kaufman 1972, 367]. The essence of God is his moral nature. Moral
attributes are the essence of God himself. So Kaufman notes that he who
requires justice and righteousness and compassion from human beings is
himself just and righteous and compassionate. This is the prophetic
view. The moral person can metaphorically be said to share in divinity.
This is the kind of apotheosis that you find then in the prophetic
writings, not the idea of a transformation into a divine being in life
or even after death, but the idea that one strives to be god-like by
imitating his moral actions, the idea again of <i>imitatio dei</i>.</p>

<p>A third feature of the prophetic writings, this is again underscored
by Kaufman, but also many other scholars, and that is the prophets'
view of history, their particular view of history, their interpretation
of the catastrophic events of 722 and 586. It is an interpretation that
centers on their elevation of morality, because the prophets insisted
that morality was a decisive, if not the decisive factor, in the
nation's history. Israel's acceptance of God's covenant placed certain
religious and moral demands on her [Kaufman 1972, 365]. Now in the
Deuteronomistic view that we have talked about, one sin is singled out
as being historically decisive for the nation. Other sins are punished,
absolutely. But only one is singled out as being historically decisive
for the nation, and that is the sin of idolatry, particularly the
idolatry of the royal house.</p>

<p>So the Deuteronomistic historian presents the tragic history of the
two kingdoms as essentially a sequence of idolatrous aberrations, which
were followed by punishment. And this cycle continued until finally
there had to be complete destruction. While it is certainly true that
moral sins and other religious sins in Israel were punishable in the
Deuteronomist's view, it is really only the worship of other gods that
brings about national collapse, national exile.</p>

<p>And that view is exemplified in 2 Kings 17, which I have read to
you. It does not mention moral sins as leading to the collapse of the
state. It harps on idolatry. Idolatry was what provoked God to drive
the nation into exile. The view of the classical prophets is a little
different. Israel's history is determined by moral factors, not just
religious factors. So the nation is punished not only for idolatry, but
for moral failings. And, of course, the two are to a large degree
intertwined. But the emphasis on the moral is striking in the prophets.
And it may not be so startling to hear that God would doom a generation
or doom a nation for grave moral sins, like murder and violence. This
is something we have already seen in the generation of the flood. The
cities of Sodom and Gomorrah--they were destroyed for grievous
violations of morality: murder, violence and so on. The prophets,
however, are claiming that the nation is doomed because of commonplace
wrongs, because of bribe-taking, because of false scales and false
weights that are being used in the marketplace. These are the crimes
for which destruction of the nation and exile will take place. Amos 2:6
through 8:</p>

<blockquote>Thus said the Lord:<br />
For three transgressions of Israel,<br />
For four, I will not revoke it [the decree of destruction]:<br />
Because they have sold for silver<br />
Those whose cause was just [taking bribes in a courtroom
setting],<br />
And the needy for a pair of sandals.<br />
You who trample the heads of the poor<br />
Into the dust of the ground,<br />
And make the humble walk a twisted course!</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So this is the first difference really between the Deuteronomistic
interpretation of the nation's history--the destruction of Israel--and
the prophetic interpretation. For the prophets, the national
catastrophes are just punishment for sin, but not just the sin of
idolatry, for all sins no matter how petty, now matter how venial,
because all sins violate the terms of the covenant code, which is given
specially to Israel. And the terms of the covenant--being vassals to
the sovereign Yahweh means treating co-vassals in a particular way, and
it is breach of covenant not to do that.</p>

<p>And, again, how much the prophets were harking back to an older
tradition, to ancient traditions about Israel and its covenant
relationship, traditions according to which Israel's redemption and
election entailed moral obligations; how much they were the ones to
actually generate and argue for this idea again is hotly debated by
scholars. It is not an issue that we need to decide. But I would note
that the primacy of morality in Israelite religion certainly dates back
at least to the times of the earliest prophets, Amos in the eighth
century for example, and may indeed have had antecedents. It certainly
didn't just arise in the exile as some scholars would have us believe.
It certainly was not the invention of the Deuteronomistic historian.
It's alive and well in some of these very early prophets.</p>

<p>I am going to turn now to the second difference between the
Deuteronomistic and the prophetic interpretation of Israel's history.
And that is that the prophets coupled their message of tragedy and doom
with a message of hope and consolation. And this is something that just
simply doesn't come within the purview of the Deuteronomistic
historian's writing. First let me say a little bit about the message of
doom and then the message of hope and consolation. One of the things
that's so interesting in the classical prophets is that they give a new
content to older Israelite ideas about the end of days, or what we call
eschatology. <i>Eschatology</i> = an account of the <i>eschaton</i>,
<i>eschaton</i> meaning the end. So eschatology is an account of the
end.</p>

<p>The prophets warned that unless they changed, the people were going
to suffer the punishment that was due them. And, in fact, the people
were very foolish to be eagerly awaiting or eagerly expecting what was
popularly known as the Day of Yahweh, or the Day of the Lord. And so
the prophets refer to the Day of Yahweh as if it were a popular
conception out there in the general culture. It was a popular idea at
the time that on some future occasion God would dramatically intervene
in world affairs and he would do so on Israel's behalf. He would lead
Israel in victory over her enemies. They would be punished. Israel
would be restored to her full and former glory. And that day, the Day
of the Lord or the Day of Yahweh, in the popular mind, was going to be
a marvelous day, a day of victory for Israel, triumph for Israel and a
day of vengeance on her enemies. Amos 5:18 and 29, talks about the
people as desirous of the Day of Yahweh. They are very confident that
this is going to be a day of light, a day of blessing, a day of
victory, he says.</p>

<p>But the prophets, Amos among them, tell a different story. According
to them, if there is no change then this Day of Yahweh is not going to
be some glorious thing that the people should be eagerly awaiting. It's
not going to be a day of triumph for Israel. It will not be a day of
vengeance on her enemies. It's going to be a dark day of destruction.
It is going to be a day of doom when God will finally call his own
people to account. So this is another instance of the way in which the
prophets try to radically surprise their audience by taking an older
concept and reversing its meaning, changing its meaning. And here they
have transformed the popular image of the Day of Yahweh from one of
national triumph to one of national judgment. Amos 5:18 through 20:</p>

<blockquote>Ah, you who wish<br />
For the day of the Lord!<br />
Why should you want<br />
The day of the Lord?<br />
It shall be darkness, not light!<br />
--As if a man should run from a lion<br />
And be attacked by a bear;<br />
Or if he got indoors,<br />
Should lean his hand on the wall<br />
And be bitten by a snake![there is going to be no place to hide, in
other words}<br />
Surely the day of the Lord shall be<br />
Not light, but darkness,<br />
Blackest night without a glimmer.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Or chapter 8:9 through 12:</p>

<blockquote>And in that day--declares my Lord God--<br />
I will make the sun set at noon,<br />
I will darken the earth on a sunny day.<br />
I will turn your festivals into mourning<br />
And all your songs into dirges;<br />
I will put sackcloth on all loins<br />
And tonsures on every head. [mourning rites]<br />
I will make it mourn as for an only child,<br />
All of it as on a bitter day.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So again at the heart of this idea that the Day of Yahweh is being
transformed into this day of judgment, is the old idea that God is the
God of history. Right? God can control the destiny of nations. He can
control the actions of nations. That is not a new idea. But in the
past, or not so much in the past, I suppose--it would have been present
to the prophets--the prophets were reacting against a notion that God's
involvement with other nations was always undertaken on Israel's
behalf. This is the idea they seem to be battling. In other words, they
are battling the idea or the assumption that God controlled other
nations by exercising judgment on them and punishing them and
subjecting them to Israel. And the prophets are challenging this idea.
And they are making what would have been heard as a shocking and
extraordinary claim.</p>

<p>God is, of course, yes, a God of history, of all history. He is
concerned with all nations, not only Israel. But his involvement with
other nations doesn't extend merely to their subjugation. If need be,
or rather if Israel deserves, then God will raise up another nation
against her. So the final chapter in Amos begins by proclaiming this
idea of utter destruction. I will slay them all, God says, and "not one
of them shall survive." Wherever they hide, under the earth, in the
heavens, at the bottom of the sea, God is going to haul them out and He
is going to slay them. And what about the covenant? Isn't it a
guarantee of privilege or safety? Again, for Amos, its primary function
is to bind the nation in a code of conduct, and violations of that code
are going to be severely punished. So in chapter 9 verses 7 to 8, Amos
makes the startling claim that in God's eyes Israel is really no
different from the rest of the nations. He elevated her. He can also
lower her.</p>

<blockquote>To Me, O Israelites, you are<br />
Just like the Ethiopians<br />
True, I brought Israel up<br />
From the land of Egypt,<br />
But also the Philistines from Caphtor<br />
And the Aramaeans from Kir.<br />
Behold, the Lord God has His eye<br />
Upon the sinful kingdom:<br />
I will wipe it off<br />
The face of the earth!</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>These are harsh, harsh words. And you also have to remember that
Amos was living in a time of relative peace and prosperity, about 750.
National confidence is riding high. The people of Israel were pretty
convinced that God was with them. They weren't in any real imminent or
obvious danger. And Amos was convinced that despite this external
appearance of health, the nation was diseased. They were guilty of
social crimes and unfaithfulness to their covenantal obligations. And
so he says they are headed down this path of destruction. Perhaps
because of the optimism of the time, Amos had to emphasize this message
of doom, because his book is a pretty depressing book.</p>

<p>Later prophets who were speaking in a different historical setting,
in a more desperate historical setting, would often speak words of much
more comfort and hope. But Amos doesn't do this. He does indicate that
his purpose is the reformation or the reorientation of the nation. He
wants to awaken Israel to the fact that change is needed. Amos 5:14 and
15, "Seek good and not evil,/That you may live,/And that the Lord, the
God of Hosts,/May truly be with you,/As you think." Right now you think
he is with you. He's not. Change, so that he will <i>truly</i> be with
you. "Hate evil and love good,/And establish justice in the
gate;/Perhaps the Lord, the God of Hosts,/Will be gracious to the
remnant of Joseph." The "perhaps" is important, and it is very
indicative of Amos' fatalism. This is very much a fatalistic book. The
overriding theme of Amos' message is that punishment is inevitable. It
is pretty much inevitable. And this is one of the reasons that most
scholars believe that the final verses of the book, verses halfway
through [chapter 9 verse] 8 down to 15, are a later addition by an
editor. It is an epilogue, and it was likely added in order to relieve
the gloom and the pessimism and the fatalism of the prophet's message,
because in these verses, Amos does an almost complete about-face. We
have just finished the first half of verse 8 in Chapter 9. So 9:8a--you
have this oracle of complete and devastating judgment: "Behold, the
Lord God has His eye/Upon the sinful kingdom:/I will wipe it off/The
face of the earth." But then, the second half of the verse, and the
beginning of this epilogue that has been added, immediately dilutes
this: "But, I will not wholly wipe out/The House of Jacob --declares
the Lord." It seems that an editor has qualified this last oracle of
doom, has desired to qualify this last oracle of doom. And the editor
continues,</p>

<blockquote>For I will give the order<br />
And shake the House of Israel--<br />
Through all the nations--<br />
As one shakes [sand] in a sieve,<br />
And not a pebble falls to the ground.<br />
All the sinners of My people<br />
Shall perish by the sword,<br />
Who boast,<br />
"Never shall the evil<br />
Overtake us or come near us."<br />
In that day,<br />
I will set up again the fallen booth of David;<br />
I will mend its breaches and set up its ruins anew.<br />
I will build it firm as in the days of old,<br />
[...]<br />
 A time is coming--declares the Lord --<br />
[...]<br />
 When the mountains shall drip wine<br />
And all the hills shall wave [with grain].<br />
I will restore my people Israel.<br />
They shall rebuild ruined cities and inhabit them;<br />
[...]<br />
They shall till gardens and eat their fruits.<br />
And I will plant them upon their soil,<br />
Nevermore to be uprooted<br />
From the soil I have given them--said the Lord your God.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>In other words, according to this epilogue, God's punishment of
Israel isn't the end of the story. It is one step in a process, and the
affliction and the punishment serve a purpose. It is to purge the
dross, to chasten Israel. They are going to be put through a sieve.
Only the sinners will really perish. A remnant, presumably a righteous
remnant, will be permitted to survive and in due time that remnant will
be restored.</p>

<p>To summarize Amos, and hopefully this will give us then some
foothold as we move into other prophetic books, we need to understand
that the Book of Amos is a set of oracles by a prophet addressing a
concrete situation in the northern kingdom. It's been subject to some
additions that reflect the perspective of a later editor. Amos' message
was that sin would be punished by God and it would be punished on a
national level--the nation would fall. When the northern kingdom fell,
it was understood to be a fulfillment of Amos' words. The Assyrians
were the instruments of God's just punishment. So his words were
preserved in Judah. After Judah fell, presumably a later editor added a
few key passages to reflect this later reality, most significantly the
oracle against Judah in chapter 2, verses 4-5, and the epilogue in
chapter 9, verse 8b through 15, which explicitly seem to refer to the
fall of the southern kingdom. It refers to a future day when the fallen
booth of David will be raised. That reflects a knowledge of the end of
Judah, the end of the Davidic kingship. And the phrase "on that day"
which is used, is a phrase that often signals what we feel is an
editorial insertion in a prophetic book. It is pointing forward to some
vague future time of restoration. Okay. On Monday, we are going to be
moving on to Hosea and Isaiah.</p>
