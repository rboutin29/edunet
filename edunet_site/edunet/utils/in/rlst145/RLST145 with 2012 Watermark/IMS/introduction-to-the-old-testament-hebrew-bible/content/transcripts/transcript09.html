<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> Today we're going to be turning to
Leviticus. And Leviticus is a primary document of the Priestly School.
And we identify this work as Priestly because it deals with matters
that were of special concern to and under the jurisdiction of priests:
the sanctuary, its cultic rituals, the system of sacrifices, the
distinction between the holy and the profane and the pure and the
impure. So the Priestly materials are found as a block in Leviticus, a
large part of Numbers, and then they're scattered throughout Genesis
and Exodus. And because of these common themes, we say that they were
produced by a Priestly School: we hypothesize a Priestly School. We
don't quite clearly understand exactly what that means and who and
exactly when. These materials emerged over a period of centuries;
that's clear. They reached their final form in the exilic or
post-exilic period. But they certainly often preserve older cultic
traditions and priestly traditions as well.</p>

<p>We can break the book of Leviticus down into the units that are
listed on that side of the board. You have in chapters 1 through 7 the
sacrificial system. Chapters 8 through 10 recount the installation of
Aaron as high priest and the Aaronides then as the priestly clan within
Israel. Chapters 11 through 15 cover the dietary system, the dietary
laws as well as the ritual purity laws. Chapter 16 describes the
procedure to be followed on the Day of Atonement or Yom Kippur.
Chapters 17 through 26 then are a block of material that's referred to
as the "Holiness code" because of its special emphasis on holiness. So
most scholars think that that block of material comes from a different
priestly school, and so we designate that H: holiness. The relative
dates of P and H, P now meaning the non-H parts of the Priestly
materials, they're much debated; but I think increasingly, the
consensus is that H--the block of material in Leviticus 17 through 26
and then also its got passages scattered around other parts of the
Bible--but the consensus increasingly is that H is later. It's a
redactor or editor of the other priestly materials. So P is a difficult
term of reference, because P can refer to the entirety of Priestly
writings altogether. But when we think about H and talk about H then P
in contrast to H means the Priestly writings that are not H: so maybe a
small P and a capital P, I don't know.</p>

<p>Now, the Priestly materials have for a long time been I think a
devalued part of the Hebrew Bible. And scholarship of the nineteenth
century and most of the twentieth century is generally characterized by
a deep-seated bias that views impurity rules as primitive and
irrational taboos, and sacrifice as controlled savagery that's empty of
any spiritual meaning. Religion without such rites is evolutionarily
superior or higher; more spiritually meaningful. And with those kinds
of attitudes, it's not difficult to understand why scholarship on
Leviticus and those parts of the Bible tend to be rather dismissive. In
the later part of the twentieth century, the situation began to change.
As anthropologists and ethnographers began to study the danger
avoidance practices of many cultures, the taboos and rituals of many
cultures, including modern Western culture, new avenues for
understanding the danger avoidance practices of the Bible began to
emerge.</p>

<p>Anthropologist Mary Douglas changed forever the way scholars would
approach the impurity rules of the Bible, because she insisted on their
interpretation as symbols, symbols that conveyed something meaningful
to those who followed them. Biblical scholars like Jacob Milgrom and
more recently Jonathan Klawans, attuned to developments in the social
sciences, have made very great advances in our understanding of
Israelite purity practices. They've tended to view the elaborate and
carefully constructed texts of P as part of a system whose meaning
derives from the larger cultural matrix or grid in which those
materials are embedded. How much the system laid down by P represents
what ordinary Israelite Judeans thought and did; how much these rules
were actually enacted and followed; how much they drew upon older
random practices, brought them together, modified them, imposed some
semblance of order upon them; how much the represent just he ideal
construction or blueprint of an elite group: these are all unanswerable
questions. The fact is, no one really knows. But we do know from living
cultures that people do engage in all kinds of ritual and symbolic
actions because of genuine beliefs about the importance of those
actions, because those rituals and symbols are extraordinarily
meaningful to them. And in any event, our primary concern is with the
program of the texts as they stand before us: is there a symbolism
operating here? What are the key ideas and the key themes of the
Priestly material? How do these ideas or how does this material jive
with other aspects of Israelite religion that we've talked about so
far? What ultimately is the purpose toward which these materials are
aiming?</p>

<p>Well, like the rest of the ancient world, Israel had a cultic
system, and that cultic system featured a sanctuary: a sacred space
with holy objects; sacred objects, where priests performed a variety of
ritual acts. So Israelite-Judean religion on the ground shared many
cultic forms and practices and rituals with Canaanite and Ancient Near
Eastern culture generally. Sanctuaries in the ancient world were
understood to be the dwelling place of the deity. Sacrifices were
offered to the deity in his or her sanctuary. P describes a portable
sanctuary, a <i>mishkan</i>, that's used in the wilderness period. Now,
if you look on your handout, there's a reconstruction of this tent-like
sanctuary at the top as well as a schematization of its contents below.
So woven curtains hung from wooden frames that could easily be
assembled and disassembled. And these curtains surround the sacred
precincts. You see that in the top picture. And within those precincts,
within that enclosure, there's a large, open courtyard. That was
accessible to all Israelites. The main sacrificial altar with a large
ramp stood in that courtyard as well as a basin that was there for
ablutions. And then halfway across the courtyard, there was a screen
that marked the entrance to another little enclosure, which is the
shrine proper, the sanctuary proper; and only priests have access to
that area. The shrine or sanctuary housed an incense altar. And then on
one side a seven-branched lampstand or menorah. And on the other, a
table, which held loaves of bread that were changed on a weekly
basis.</p>

<p>The backmost square-shaped chamber of that inner shrine was the
inner sanctum or the holy of holies. And that was accessible only to
the high priest and only on the Day of Atonement following a series of
heightened purity observances. Inside that holy of holies was the ark.
It was about four feet by two-and-a-half feet. It was a wooden ark
covered in gold. On top was a kind of covering. It's referred to as a
<i>kapporeth</i>: we don't really know what this word means, it's
traditionally translated "mercy seat," I think that's how the JPS
[Jewish Publication Society] might translate it. But it's some kind of
gold cover and then there were two cherubim, these enormous winged
lions that flanked the ark. Likely they were connected to that mercy
seat cover. If so, then what they were was a throne. And we have in
Ancient Near Eastern iconography thrones of this type. We have pictures
of gods and kings seated on these seats, the sides of which are these
giant winged cherubim, and then their feet rest on a footstool.
Likewise, in some biblical verses, God or Yahweh is described as
enthroned upon the cherubim. The ark then is said to serve as his
footstool. So that's sort of the box that he would have rested his feet
on. The ark itself contained the tablets of the covenant. And so it was
a testament to the covenant between God and Israel.</p>

<p>Interestingly, unlike most ancient sanctuaries, the Israelite
sanctuary did not contain a statue of the deity. And that's I think
evidence of the very strong aniconic tendency of Israelite religion.
Nevertheless, God was believed to be present in the sanctuary. Often in
the form of a cloud that will fill, that will descend to fill the
tabernacle, particularly as it's assembled in a new encampment, and
then God will descend down and the cloud will fill the tabernacle. So
it is God's presence there that sanctifies, which simply means "makes
holy, makes sacred," to sanctify, to make holy, the tabernacle. And to
understand this, we need to understand the Priestly conception of
holiness.</p>

<p>Now, the Hebrew word "holy" has a root meaning of separate.
Separate. That which is holy is separate. It's withdrawn from common,
everyday use. In the Priestly view, only God is intrinsically holy;
intrinsically holy. God can impart holiness to, he can sanctify,
persons and places and things when they're brought into a specific kind
of relationship with him, a relationship that's best described as a
relationship of ownership. What is holy is what is in God's realm,
something that's separated to him. That which is outside God's realm is
common. The Hebrew word for "common" is sometimes translated by the
English word "profane." That has a negative connotation in English, but
in fact it really doesn't bear that negative connotation. Profane
simply means not holy; not sacred. We use it differently now. But the
fact is that the common or profane state is the natural default state
of most objects and things. This table is just profane. It's common.
It's available for everyday use. It's not separated or marked off for
special kind of treatment because it's holy. For a common object to
become holy, you need a special act of dedication to God, an act of
sanctification to transfer the thing to God or God's realm or God's
service.</p>

<p>So holiness entails necessarily separation in both its positive and
negative aspects. It entails separation of an object to that which
sanctifies it, which is God; and it involves separation from, in the
form of safeguards against, anything that would threaten to remove its
sanctity. So separation from that which threatens its sanctity. Holy
things are holy because they are removed from the realm of the common
by means of rules or safeguards that demarcate them as different and
separate and determine that we use them differently. The preservation
of holy status therefore depends on those rules and safeguards. Their
observance protects the holy object from profanation, from being
profaned, reverting from holy status back to common status.</p>

<p>Now, it's evident from the schematic representation or the way I've
described the sanctuary that holiness increases as you move deeper into
the sanctuary. And the principle here that holiness increases as
proximity to God increases. The principle is graphically demonstrated
in spatial terms. So in the biblical view, the area or the land outside
the Israelite camp is just common, profane land. The Israelite camp
bears a certain degree of holiness. Then as you move in, the outer
courtyard, the outer enclosure of the sanctuary, bears a slightly
higher degree of holiness. It's accessible to Israelites who are pure.
The sanctuary proper, which is in closer proximity to God, bears a
still higher degree of holiness: it's accessible only to the priests,
who are said to be the holy ones within Israel. And then the inner
shrine is the holiest area: it's accessible only to the holiest member
of the nation, the high priest.</p>

<p>You have similar concentric circles of holiness characterizing the
priestly conception of time. There are ordinary, common, profane days,
work days. Then there are certain holy days: for example, the New Year
or the Passover holidays--that's where our word "holiday" comes from,
holy day--and they are separated and demarcated from common time by
special rules that mark them as different. Holier than these days is
the Sabbath, which is demarcated by even further rules and observances.
And the holiest day is Yom Kippur, known as the Sabbath of Sabbaths.
This day is separated from all other days by additional rules and
observances in keeping with its profound holiness. The holiness of
persons, of objects, of time and of space all converge on Yom Kippur,
because it's only on this most holy day that the most holy person, high
priest, enters the most holy of holies, the innermost shrine, and
performs a ritual upon the most holy of objects, the mercy seat and ark
itself once a year.</p>

<p>Well, now we need to consider the deep connection that exists
between holiness and purity. Because the two are not identical despite
massive amounts of scholarship that confuses this issue: thinks holy
means pure, thinks common means impure, and it just doesn't: these are
different binary oppositions. The two are not identical. To be holy
means to belong to or to be in the realm of God. Things can't become
holy and can't come into contact with the holy or the sacred if they
are not first pure. Purity, which is the absence of impurity, is a
prerequisite for access to the holy or for holy status. To be in a
state of purity simply means that one is qualified to contact the
sacred: to enter the sacred precincts, to handle sacred objects, and so
on. To be in a state of impurity simply means that one is not qualified
to contact the sacred. So if you're impure at home and just minding
your own business, it's no big deal. It's only a problem if you decide
you want to go to the sanctuary. So purity and impurity are states of
qualification or disqualification for contact with sancta. The holy is
by definition pure: by definition. Only that which is free of impurity
can contact the holy. If an impure object--and you will see here these
overlapping pairs, which were also in your handout--if you can imagine
the lower pair sort of being plunked down on top of this pair, that
will give you an idea of what we're trying to convey with this image.
Okay? Things are either holy or common. But if they're holy, they must
be pure. Common objects can be pure or impure; it just depends whether
or not they've been in contact with a source of impurity or not.
Alright? If--but notice that the holy and the impure are never
conjoined--if an impure object comes in contact with a holy object,
then the holy object is immediately defiled; it's immediately rendered
impure. The word "defiled" means to take on some form of ritual
impurity. And it loses its holy status automatically. So it becomes
both impure and profane.</p>

<p>To be restored, then, you're going to have to have two things
happening. First of all, it's got to be purified--you've got to get rid
of the ritual impurity, so there'll have to be some ritual procedure
that purges the impurity. So once you've done that, you've made it
pure; but it's still common, profane. So it has to, if it's to be made
holy again, it has to be rededicated or given over to God again,
re-sanctified: maybe a little holy anointing oil poured on it, that's
one means of sanctification; simply handing it over to God, elevating
it towards God is another way of re-sanctifying something. But there
has to be two steps: a purification and then a sanctification to make
it holy again. Increased access to the holy requires increased, an
increased degree of purity. That's the connection between holiness and
purity. So the purity that's required of a priest, who has access to
the sanctuary proper, is higher than that of an Israelite, who has
access to the outer courtyard only. The purity required of the high
priest is even greater.</p>

<p>So to be pure, one must separate ones self from sources of impurity.
What are these sources of impurity? And I hope you've had a chance to
look at the reading material, because I'm going to go through this
relatively quickly. Jonathan Klawans has been the most vocal proponent
of the claim that biblical texts speak of two distinct types of
impurity: ritual impurity and moral impurity, which I have up here [on
the board]. You've read the short article he has in the <i>Jewish Study
Bible</i>, but he's also written about this at great length in other
places. And according to Klawans and others, ritual impurity arises
from physical substances and states which are not in themselves sinful.
There's no intimate connection with sin when we're talking about ritual
impurity. In fact, a lot of ritual impurity is unavoidable and
sometimes even obligatory, right? Sexual contact makes one ritually
impure, and yet God commands humans to be fruitful and multiply.
Burying the dead makes one ritually impure, but God commands proper
care of the dead. So there's nothing inherently sinful about
contracting ritual impurity.</p>

<p>Ritual impurity, which is generally permitted, is distinguished by
the characteristics I've quickly jotted down here. It's contagious,
that is, it's transferred to other persons or objects, depending on how
receptive they are--perhaps by physical touch, perhaps in the case of
severe impurity by sharing an enclosed space, by being together under
an overhanging roof, tent. Ritual impurity is also impermanent. It can
be removed or reduced through rituals of ablutions or just the passage
of time or other sorts of ritual observances. Ritual impurity also
defiles or renders impure sancta, and so it has to be kept separate
from sancta. In very severe cases, it can even defile some common
objects, and in those cases, the source of impurity might have to be
isolated or excluded if necessary.</p>

<p>Now, the concept of ritual impurity was a central and integral
feature of most, if not all, ancient religions. And the biblical laws
of purity and impurity strongly resemble those of other Ancient Near
Eastern cultures: Egyptian, Mesopotamian, even Hittite culture. And
certainly, there are Ancient Near Eastern and Canaanite roots for
Israelite purity practices. But the system of ritual purity and
impurity that is crafted in the Priestly writings of the Hebrew Bible
represents an attempt to monotheize, to monotheize Israelite purity
practices and to create a system that differentiated Israel from her
close neighbors. So, for example, impurity was often connected with
belief in evil spirits and impure demons. It's quite possible that
Israel's purification rituals may have originated and even long endured
as rituals of exorcism that expelled a demon who was believed to be
causing the affliction in question. That may be their origin and
source; but in the Priestly writings, impurity is generally divorced
from any association with evil spirits.</p>

<p>Some scholars theorize that the ritual purity system reflects an
original concern with health or hygiene. But this isn't very
convincing. Only one set of diseases is said to generate ritual
impurity, and many substances that are widely considered unhygienic by
most cultures--for example, human and animal excrement--these are not
sources of ritual impurity to Israel's priests. So Klawans is among
those who insist that any effort to understand the purpose and the
meaning of Israelite purity practices as schematized by the
monotheizing Priestly writers in Leviticus 12 through 16--and again
whether actual Israelite Judeans did this or understood things this
way, we'll never know--but to understand the schematization of, the
monotheizing schematization of Israel's purity practices, we would do
better to ignore questions of origins and to attend to the larger
symbolism of impurity and holiness in these writings: in particular, we
need to try to understand the antithetical relationship between
impurity and holiness. The two are opposites. They are opposed and
antagonistic towards one another.</p>

<p>So Klawans points out, as you know, that there are three main
sources of impurity in P. First of all, corpses and certain carcasses
are a source of ritual impurity<i>: sara'at</i>, which is this--we
translate it "scale disease," it's been called leprosy. It's definitely
not leprosy. People who know such things have read the details in the
biblical texts and it's not what is truly known as leprosy. But it's
some sort of skin disease, flaking skin disease or other sorts of boils
and skin states that seem to be associated, at least in the Israelite
mind, with decomposition and death. We have a couple of passages, one
in the book of Numbers, one in the book of Job, which describe this
condition in a way that identifies it with death. An aborted fetus is
often described as looking like it has this condition, for example--not
often, it happens once in the book of Job. But the point is there's a
connection between this condition, this skin condition, and its
decomposition and death. The third source of ritual impurity would be
genital discharges, both normal and diseased. So Klawans notes in the
article you read that the physical substances and states that are
labeled impure and are therefore designated as antithetical to the
realm of holiness are states that are associated with death on the one
hand, and procreation on the other. Why should this be?</p>

<p>The Priestly conception of god, you will recall, is of an immortal
and asexual being. Think back to the first creation story, which is the
Priestly creation story. To enter the realm of the holy, in which there
is neither death nor procreation, requires a separation from death and
procreation. It is association with death and sexuality that renders
one impure and disqualifies one from entering the holy sanctuary. That
is not to say that one shouldn't deal with death or sexuality in the
ordinary course of life. On the contrary, God explicitly commands
humans to be fruitful and multiply, and he does that in the P-source,
right? In Genesis 1. He commands proper care of the dead, and he also
does that in the P-source. It simply means that one cannot enter the
holy sanctuary, God's realm, when impure through contact with death or
sexuality.</p>

<p>So according to Klawans, ritual purification involved separation
from those aspects of humanity, death and sex, that are least God-like.
To enter God's realm requires imitation of God or <i>imitatio dei</i>,
right, an idea that I put up here<i>, imitatio dei</i>: imitation of
god. And Klawans further argues that the concept of <i>imitatio dei</i>
also explains the practice of sacrifice which, on the face of it,
contradicts the idea that you must avoid death in connection with the
holy, right? Because sacrifice entails killing right in the sanctuary,
killing of animals right in the sanctuary. So Klawans argues, and I
quote, that "sacrifice involves in part the controlled exercise of
complete power over an animal's life and death." Which is, he says
"…precisely one of the powers that Israel's God exercises over human
beings. As God is to humanity, humans in imitation of God are towards
their domesticated animals." So the process of sacrifice, I won't go
into his argument here, but Klawans develops a strong argument that the
process of sacrifice can be understood itself as an act of <i>imitatio
dei</i>, because sacrifice involves a variety of behaviors in the
biblical text that are analogous to behaviors attributed elsewhere in
the biblical texts to God: the care and feeding and raising of domestic
animals, the selection of one that is deemed perfect, control over its
life and death and so on. And these are all spoken of in terms that are
analogous to terms used to describe God as the shepherd of his flock of
Israel and in control of life and death and so on. So Klawans argues
that the process of sacrifice, which grants the offerer complete
control over life and death, is a kind of <i>imitatio dei</i>.</p>

<p>But Klawans also asserts, and I quote, that "<i>Imitatio dei</i>
does not exhaustively explain sacrifice in ancient Israel," and in
fact, we should be surprised if any one single theory would indeed
explain sacrifice. So he just says that there are really two organizing
principles or overriding concerns in the Priestly traditions and the
Priestly materials regarding sacrifice. The first, as we've seen, is
<i>imitatio dei</i>. But the second is a desire to attract and maintain
the divine presence, the continued presence of God in the sanctuary.
The majority of the sacrifices that are described in the opening
chapters of Leviticus, in Leviticus 1 through 7, are voluntary
sacrifices. These are sacrifices that are offered as gifts or in times
of celebration. I put a little list of them up here, but the first
three are the ones that will concern us now.</p>

<p>We have first of all, the whole offering or "burnt offering," it's
sometimes called. This is when an animal is entirely burned to create,
as the text says, a pleasant smelling odor or pleasant smelling smoke
that ascends to God. So according to P, the priests are to offer two
such burnt offerings with pleasing-smelling odors to the Lord every
day: one in the morning and one in the evening on a regular basis from
the community. The second kind of offering that's described is the
grain offering. This is a gift of flour and oil and incense, which is
burned after a portion is removed for the priests as dues to the
priests, the rest is burned on the altar again with a sweet smell from
the incense. Third, we have a set of offerings known as well-being
offerings, "peace offerings" it's sometimes translated. These offerings
are generally consumed by the offerer and his family, very often in a
festive situation, as a big feast, after certain portions are donated
to the priests, again. Well-being offerings are of three main types.
You have the thanksgiving offering. You have a freewill offering--just
because someone wants to do this, a freewill offering. And you have a
vow offering that would be offered on the successful completion of a
vow, for example. And these sacrifices are all entirely optional. They
were offered in celebration. They were offered in thanksgiving or upon
the successful completion of a vow. In other words, the sacrificial
cult was primarily a vehicle for worshipers' expression of a wide range
of emotions: joy over the birth of a child, thankfulness for a good
harvest and so on.</p>

<p>Now, texts from Ancient Near Eastern cultures suggest that a central
function of the rituals that were performed in sanctuaries was to
secure the perpetual aid and blessing of a well-disposed deity. And in
important ways, the Israelite cult is strikingly similar, particularly
in the sacrifices I've just described. The Israelites certainly hoped
to secure the perpetual aid and blessing and protection of a
well-disposed deity. Blessing and benefaction flow from God's presence
in the midst of the community in his sanctuary: when he is there, there
is blessing. So Klawans follows earlier scholars in suggesting that the
rituals and sacrifices performed in this sanctuary were designed to
ensure God's continued residence within and blessing of the community.
In particular, the daily burnt offerings sacrificed by the priests
twice each day, and emitting this pleasing odor: these were an effort
to attract the deity. Likewise, the gifts--the other foods and pleasing
odors of the sacrifices brought by individual worshipers--attracted and
maintained the continued presence of God in the sanctuary. So this is
the second overriding concern or organizing principle of the sacrifice:
not simply that there should be <i>imitatio dei</i> within God's realm,
but also that the activities there should attract and maintain the
presence of the deity for the well-being of the community.</p>

<p>But just as God is attracted by certain kinds of behaviors, so he is
repelled by others. And in the Priestly system, grave sins generate an
impurity, now a moral impurity, so now we're coming to the second kind
of impurity, moral impurity that repels the divine presence. Okay? So
moral impurity is the second kind of impurity that's described by
Klawans and others. In contrast to ritual impurity, moral impurity does
arise from the commission of sins. Ritual impurity does not: there's
nothing that's prohibitive about-- you're never told not to become
ritually impure, okay? There's nothing sinful about it, inherently. But
moral impurity arises specifically from the commission of certain
heinous sins specifically. The three that I've listed here are the
biggies: idolatry, homicide and sexual transgressions. These are
spelled out in Leviticus 18 and Leviticus 20, those two chapters.
Besides defiling the sinner, moral impurity symbolically defiles
various sancta, especially the sanctuary, but also God's name and also
the Holy Land itself.</p>

<p>Moral impurity differs from ritual impurity not simply because of
its origin in sin, but also in the fact that it's not contagious,
alright? You don't contract impurity by touching a murderer, the way
that you contract ritual impurity by touching somebody with gonorrhea.
Also, moral impurity is not removed or reducible through rituals,
through washings and launderings, ritual ablutions and the like. That
does not touch moral impurity in a person. Moral purity of persons can
be achieved only by punishment for heinous sins: for example, the
punishment of <i>chirate</i>, or cutting off, is a divine punishment of
being extirpated from the House of Israel; death, alright, that's one
way to be rid of moral impurity. Also it can be achieved by simply
avoiding or abstaining from defiling, immoral acts in the first place:
that's another way to achieve moral purity. Also, if you atone for
unwitting sins that you perhaps later realize and regret; acknowledge
and confess, then that can also have a reduced moral impurity.</p>

<p>Very severe moral impurity defiles the innermost areas of the
sanctuary as well as the land. Now, the sanctuary can be purified of
moral impurity, and I'll come back and talk about that in a second; but
the land really cannot. Land that is repeatedly defiled, or the holy
land of God that is repeatedly defiled by sexual transgressions, for
example, cannot be purified. Eventually it will simply "vomit out," the
biblical text says, it will simply vomit out those who dwell on it.
This is a reference to exile. This is consistent with the
representation of the expulsion of the Canaanites from God's land.
Remember when God said, "The sin of the Amorites is not yet complete,
when they have sinned so much and to such a degree, they will be
vomited out and then your tenancy can begin"? The land will purge
itself of the impurity by vomiting them out. And this is consistent
then with the repeated warnings in Leviticus to the Israelites not to
engage in similar abominable and sinful practices--the sexual
transgressions, the bloodshed, the idolatry--because they too will
pollute the land until it vomits them out. They will be expelled.</p>

<p>The land is also defiled by illicit homicide. There is legal
homicide, of course, judicial death and so on in the Bible, but illicit
homicide, whether intentional or unintentional, murder or accidental
homicide. The manslayer bears blood guilt, what is referred to as
"blood guilt." That's a kind of moral impurity, and his life is forfeit
because of that. In cases of deliberate murder, blood guilt and
impurity are removed only by the death of the murderer himself: only
blood atones for blood. In cases of accidental homicide, the
perpetrator can take refuge in one of five cities that are designated
for this purpose: the five cities of refuge. They can live there until
the death of the high priest, and the death of the high priest
symbolically serves to purge or remove the blood guilt or impurity of
the accidental homicide. Idolatry also defiles the land. Offenders are
subject to stoning and the divine penalty of <i>chirate</i>, of cutting
off. The Bible repeatedly warns that idols and their cultic
appurtenances must be completely destroyed from the Holy Land, right?
The Israelites have to eradicate that, they're polluting the land.</p>

<p>Now, in contrast to the land, God's sanctuary can be purified for
moral impurity by means of a special sacrifice. And this is the fourth
sacrifice listed here, the <i>hatta't</i>, which is the purification
sacrifice. It's often erroneously translated as a "sin offering." It's
better translated as a purification offering. How does it operate? The
blood of the animal, the blood of the sacrifice is the key to the whole
ritual. Remember that impurity and sin are often associated with death.
Holiness, that which is holy, is often associated with life. And if the
two are antithetical then it makes sense. If impurity is associated
with death, it makes sense that its antithesis, holiness, would be
associated with life. According to the Priestly source, blood, the
blood that courses through one's veins, represents the life force.
Remember in the Noahide covenant, in Genesis 9, which is a Priestly
passage, the Priestly blood prohibition: You may not spill human blood.
And you may not eat animal flesh that has the lifeblood in it because
the blood is the life and that belongs to God, that's holy, right? So
the life force is holy and the life force is in the blood. Leviticus
17:11 says this; it repeats the blood prohibition, and then it offers a
rationale. "For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have
assigned it to you for making expiation for your lives upon the altar."
I've assigned it to you to use in sacrificial practices. It is the
blood as life that effects expiation, purging and atonement.</p>

<p>So the Priestly texts couldn't be clearer: blood represents life.
The blood of sacrificial animals is assigned by God as a detergent, if
you will, to cleanse the sanctuary of the impurities that are caused by
the sinful deeds of the Israelites. Sacrifices that purge the sanctuary
of ritual impurity, primarily the <i>hatta't,</i> always involve the
manipulation of the animal's blood, daubing it on the altar and on Yom
Kippur, actually entering the innermost shrine and sprinkling it on the
throne of God and the footstool, the ark itself. It symbolizes the
victory of the forces of life, oath and holiness over death and
impurity. Other purifactory rights that are listed in the Bible will
sometimes involve the use of reddish substances as a kind of surrogate
of blood.</p>

<p>It's a widely--it is widely and mistakenly thought that the
purification offering purifies the sinner or the impurity bearer or the
offerer. This can't be true. The <i>hatta't</i>, the purification
offering, doesn't rid a ritually impure person of their ritual
impurity. You can't even offer a sacrifice unless you're already
ritually pure, because you couldn't get into the sanctuary to offer
your sacrifice if you weren't ritually pure. You can't approach to
offer a sacrifice if you're not in a state of ritual purity already. So
purification offerings are brought after the genital discharge has
healed and passed; after the scale disease has healed and passed; after
the appropriate ablutions have been observed and the person is
essentially pure. But there's one more step they have to take before
they're integrated back into the community. The <i>hatta't</i> also
does not rid a sinner of their moral impurity, because the offering is
brought after the sinner has confessed, after the sinner has repented.
The purification offering acts on the sanctuary, not on the offerer. It
purges the sanctuary of the defilement that is symbolically--it has
symbolically suffered from the offerer's state of ritual impurity or
sinfulness. Once the sanctuary is purged, the offerer has settled his
debt, he's repaired the damage he caused. He's fully atoned, "at one"
again with God. And God is no longer repelled by the impurity that
marred his sanctuary.</p>

<p>The defiling effect of lesser transgressions is calibrated to the
sinner's intentionality and the presence or absence of repentance. So
inadvertent sins can be purged, the sanctuary defilement that they
cause can be purged by bringing a purification sacrifice. What about
deliberate sins? As long as there is repentance, the biblical text
says, then they are converted into inadvertent sins, and they also can
be purged, or the impurity they cause can be purged with a purification
sacrifice. But brazen, unrepentant sins, unrepented sins, or
unintentional sins that are never realized…these stand unremedied, and
they defile the sanctuary. So for this reason, the sanctuary has to be
regularly purged of the accumulated defilements accruing to it as a
result of such sins. Leviticus 16 describes the annual ritual which is
carried out on the day of atonement or day of purgation, it can be
called, Yom Kippur, when a <i>hatta't</i> sacrifice, a purification
sacrifice is brought on behalf of the community to purify the sanctuary
of the impurities that have been caused by Israel's sin. And the high
priest loads all of the sins and impurities of the Israelites on the
head of a goat, which then carries them off into the wilderness away
from the sanctuary.</p>

<p>Purification of the sanctuary was believed to be critical to the
health and the well-being of the community. If the sanctuary is not
purged of impurity, it can become polluted to the point when God is
driven out entirely. Jacob Milgrom has argued that there's a kind of
Archimedean principle at work here: every sin creates an impurity that
encroaches upon the realm of holiness and displaces a certain amount of
holiness. And eventually, God will be completely displaced and the
community will be left in a godless state, without blessing or
protection. So Milgrom sees the symbolic function of the purity system
this way: if the sanctuary symbolizes the presence of God, and if
impurity represents the wrongdoing of persons, then by saying that
impurity is anathema to God and pollutes his temple, the priests are
able to graphically convey the idea that sin forces God out of his
sanctuary and out of the community. Jacob Milgrom sees a moral message
at the base of this complex, symbolic picture. And that is that humans
and humans alone are responsible for the rein of wickedness and death
or the rein of righteousness and life. Human actions determine the
degree to which God can dwell on earth among his people. So the goal or
the objective of the Priestly construction or representation of
Israel's impurity laws was, in Milgrom's view, to sever impurity from
the demonic and to reinterpret it as a symbolic system reminding Israel
of the divine imperative to reject sin, to behave in ways that attract
the presence of God and do not repel him.</p>

<p>You also read an article by Milgrom where Milgrom talks about
Priestly cultic imagery serving as a kind of theodicy. A theodicy of
course is a response to the problem of evil. How can an all-powerful,
good God allow so much evil to exist and even go unpunished? And
according to Milgrom, this is the priestly answer: every sin pollutes
the sanctuary. It may not mark the sinner, but it does mark the
sanctuary. It scars the face of the sanctuary. You may think you've
gotten away with something, but every act of social exploitation, every
act of moral corruption, pollutes the sanctuary more and more until
such time as God is driven out entirely and human society is devoured
by its own viciousness and death-dealing. So again, the ethical message
here is that humans are in control of their destiny and the action of
every individual affects and influences the fate of society. This is
really the Priestly version of an old biblical doctrine, a doctrine of
collective responsibility. Sin affects…individual sin affects the
entire fabric of society. There's no such thing as an isolated evil;
our deeds affect one another. And when evildoers are finally punished,
they bring down others with them. Those others, however, aren't so
blameless, Milgrom says, because they allowed the wicked to flourish
and contribute to the pollution of the sanctuary, the corruption of
society. So P's cultic imagery is informed, according to Milgrom, by
the same communal ethic that we will see running through the Bible,
much of the Bible, until a later period. It's simply conveying that
ethic in its own modality through the symbolism of the sanctuary and
the cult.</p>

<p>The 11th chapter of Leviticus deals with the dietary laws. We don't
have time to go into them at any great length. I will say that Milgrom
has also argued that the dietary laws of Leviticus are similarly part
of a symbol system that emphasizes life over death. This is the
following evidence that he cites; the mainstays of the dietary laws are
these: first, the prohibition against eating animal blood from Genesis
9, which symbolizes the life. We also, in Leviticus 11, meat dietary
laws that are governed by criteria such as cud chewing and having a
split hoof; you can only eat animals that chew the cud and have a split
hoof. And those criteria seem arbitrary and meaningless in and of
themselves, and he says they are. But look at their practical effect:
that limits the number of animals that one can eat to a mere handful
out of the hundreds upon hundreds of creatures on the earth, that
basically leaves you with--my animal husbandry is not good here--but it
leaves you with the bovine and the ovine classes--I guess ovine are
goats and some such--so it leaves you basically with goats and sheep
and cattle. Some have hypothesized that whatever the origin of various
food taboos in Israel, the Priestly texts have tried to create a
dietary discipline that drives home the point that all life shared also
by animals is inviolable, except in the case of meat, which has been
conceded by God, and provided that the animals are slaughtered
properly, painlessly, and that their blood, which is symbolic of the
life, is not appropriated but returned to God, its sacred source.</p>

<p>So perhaps as it stands, the system of dietary laws does in fact
emphasize reverence for life. But they also serve another very
important function, and that was the formation and maintenance of a
differentiated ethnic identity or in Priestly parlance, the formation
and maintenance of a holy peoples separated out from other nations by
rules that mark her as God's people. It's surely significant that the
dietary laws are followed by a powerful exhortation to be holy in
imitation of God, Leviticus 11:43-45. So we've just had the prohibition
of not eating certain kinds of small animals, designated as anything
that swarms. And the text says,</p>

<blockquote>You shall not draw abomination upon yourselves through
anything that swarms; you shall not make yourselves unclean therewith
and thus become unclean. For I the Lord am your God: you shall sanctify
yourselves and be holy, for I am holy. You shall not make yourselves
unclean through any swarming thing that moves upon the earth. For I the
Lord am He who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God:
you shall be holy, for I am holy.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Look at how much this is emphasized. The dietary laws are presented
by the priests not as a hygienic regimen--who knows if that's how they
started--not as a sensible way to avoid various diseases that are
caused by the lack of refrigeration in the desert. Whatever the actual
origin of these various dietary taboos, they are here embedded in a
larger ideological framework concerning the need for the Israelites to
separate themselves and to be holy like their god. The dietary laws are
connected then with this theme of <i>imitatio dei</i>, of imitation of
God. As God is holy, separate and distinct, so you shall be holy.</p>

<p>I just want to take two last minutes to quickly point to this theme
of holiness that continues in the section referred to as the Holiness
Code. This theme, and the exhortation, "you shall be holy, for I the
Lord your God am holy," they find their fullest expression in the block
of text; Leviticus 17 through 26 that's referred to as the Holiness
Code. There's an important difference between Leviticus 1 through 16
and the Holiness Code. According to Leviticus 1 through 16, Israel's
priests are designated as holy: a holy class within Israel, singled
out, dedicated to the service of God and demarcated by rules that apply
only to them. Israelites may aspire to holiness, but it's not assumed.
However, in the Holiness Code, we have texts that come closer to the
idea that Israel itself is holy by virtue of the fact that God has set
Israel apart from the nations to himself, to belong to him, just as he
set apart the seventh day to himself to belong with him.</p>

<p>Holy things only exist because of safeguards, rules that keep them
separate, that demarcate them. And these safeguards and rules are
naturally addressed to human beings. They are the ones charged with the
task of preserving the holy in its residence on earth. So although
holiness derives from god, humans have a crucial role to play in
sanctification, in sanctifying the world. That's illustrated in the
case of the Sabbath. God sanctified the Sabbath at creation; he
demarcated it as holy. But Israel is the one to affirm its holiness by
observing the rules that make it different, that mark it off as holy.
So Israel doesn't just in fact affirm the holy status of the Sabbath,
they actualize the holy status of the Sabbath. If Israel doesn't
observe the prohibitions that distinguish the Sabbath as sacred, it's
automatically desecrated. "You shall keep the Sabbath, for it is holy
for you. He who profanes it shall be put to death. Whoever does work on
it, that person is cut off from among his kin." You automatically, it
is automatically desecrated and profaned if you don't observe its
rules. So there are two components integral and inseparable in the
concept of holiness: initial assignment of holy status by God and
establishment of rules to preserve that holy status, and secondly,
actualization of that holiness by humans through the observance of the
commandments and rules that mark that thing off as holy. That's going
to lead us very nicely into an understanding of the laws that mark off
Israel's status and keep Israel distinct among the nations, which we'll
be looking at on Wednesday. So please take a look at the materials that
were sent out: the Ancient Near Eastern collection and some of the
questions to guide you through this material.</p>
