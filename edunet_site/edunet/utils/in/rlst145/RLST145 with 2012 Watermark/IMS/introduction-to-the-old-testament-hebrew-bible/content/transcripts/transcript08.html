<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> So following the theophany at the
burning bush, Moses returns to Egypt, and he initiates what will become
ultimately a battle of wills between Pharaoh and God. The story in
Exodus has high drama, and lots of folkloric elements, including this
contest between Moses and Aaron on the one hand, and the magicians of
Egypt on the other hand. This kind of contest is a very common literary
device. It's a kind of "our boys are better than your boys" device. The
Egyptian magicians who are initially able to mimic some of the plagues
that are brought on by God--they are quickly bested, and Yahweh's
defeat of the magicians is tantamount to the defeat of the gods of
Egypt.</p>

<p>There are ten plagues. These include a pollution of the Nile, swarms
of frogs, lice, insects, affliction of livestock, boils that afflict
humans and animals, lightning and hail, locusts, total darkness, and
all of this climaxes in the death of the firstborn males of Egypt in
one night. And source critics looking at this material discern
numerous, diverse sources that are interwoven throughout. These sources
preserve different traditions on the number and the nature of the
plagues, as well as the principal actors in the drama: God, Moses,
Aaron. So according to the source critical analysis, no source contains
ten plagues. J has eight and E has three, and P has five, and some of
them are the same as one another, and some of them are different, and
so on. Some of them are unique to one source, some are not, but
ultimately, the claim is that these have all been merged, and have left
us then with an overall total of ten. This may in fact be true.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as much as we like to engage sometimes in this kind of
analysis about the sources that have gone into the composition of the
text, it's also always important to keep your eye on the final form of
the text as we've received it. Literary analysis that is sensitive to
the larger contours of the account will reveal the artistic hand of the
final editor. I have charted this at the top of the board here.</p>

<p>Some scholars have noticed that the plagues are organized in three
sets of three. There are literary links that connect them and make it
clear that these are three sets of three, followed by the climactic
tenth plague--and again, three and ten are ideal numbers in our
biblical texts. Each set of three shares certain structural and
literary features. So in each set, the first and second plague are
forewarned--that's what the FW is on the side--whereas the third plague
is not. So a warning, a warning, and then a third plague; a warning, a
warning, and then a third plague; a warning, a warning, and then a
third plague. In each set, the first plague is accompanied by a
notation of the time in the morning. It's also introduced by God's
speech, when God says, "Present yourself before Pharaoh," and to do
this in the morning. So each of the first plagues in the sets of three
is introduced this way. Now the second plague in each set of three is
introduced with the divine instruction, "Go to Pharaoh." The third
plague in each set has no forewarning and no introduction.</p>

<p>So this sort of structural repetition creates a crescendo that leads
then to the final and most devastating plague, which is the slaughter
of the Egyptian firstborn sons. The slaughter may be understood as
measure for measure punishment for the Egyptians' earlier killing of
Hebrew infants, but it's represented in the biblical text as
retaliation for Egypt's treatment of Israel, and Israel is referred to
as the firstborn son of Yahweh. So in Exodus 4:22, Yahweh tells Moses
to say to Pharaoh, "Thus says the Lord, 'Israel is my firstborn son. I
have said to you, "Let my son go, that he may worship Me," yet you
refuse to let him go. Now I will slay your firstborn son.'" So it's
seen as retaliation. In this last plague, God or his angel of death
passes over Egypt at midnight, slaying every Egyptian firstborn male.
Moses orders each Israelite to perform a ritual action, and this action
will protect them from the slaughter. The ritual consists of two parts.
Each family is told to sacrifice a lamb. The lamb will then be eaten as
a family meal, and its blood will be smeared on the doorposts to mark
the house so the angel of death knows to pass over that house, --and
the pun works in Hebrew, as well as English, which is kind of handy. In
addition, each family is to eat unleavened bread. So according to
Exodus, this Passover ritual was established on Israel's last night of
slavery while the angel of death passed over the dwellings that were
marked with blood.</p>

<p>The story attests to a phenomenon that's long been observed by
biblical commentators and scholars, and that is the Israelite
historicization of preexisting ritual practices. In other words, what
we probably have here are two older, separate, springtime rituals. One
would be characteristic of semi-nomadic pastoralists: the sacrifice of
the first lamb born in the spring to the deity in order to procure
favor and continued blessing on the flocks for the spring. The other
would be characteristic of agriculturalists: it would be an offering of
the very first barley that would be harvested in the spring. It would
be quickly ground into flour and used before it even has time to
ferment, [so as] to quickly offer something to the deity, again, to
procure favor for the rest of the crop. It's supposed by many that
Israel was formed from the merger, or the merging of diverse groups,
including farmers and shepherds in Canaan. The rituals of these older
groups were retained and then linked to the story of the enslavement
and liberation of the Hebrews. So you have older nature festivals and
observances that have been historicized. They're associated now with
events in the life of the new nation, rather than being grounded in the
cycles of nature. This may in fact be then part of the process of
differentiation from the practices of Israel's neighbors, who would
have celebrated these springtime rituals. So now the blood of the
sacrificial lamb is said to have protected the Hebrews from the angel
of death, and the bread now is said to have been eaten, consumed in
unleavened form, because the Hebrews left Egypt in such a hurry. They
had no time to allow the dough to rise. Historicization; and we'll see
this historicization of rituals recurring again and again.</p>

<p>And following the last plague, Pharaoh finally allows the Israelites
to go into the desert to worship their God, but he quickly changes his
mind, and he sends his infantry and his chariots in hot pursuit of the
Israelites, and they soon find themselves trapped between the Egyptians
and something referred to as <i>Yam Suph</i>, meaning Reed Sea. It
isn't the Red Sea. That's a mistranslation that occurred very, very
early on, so it's led to the notion that they were at the Gulf of
Aqaba, or somewhere near the actual big ocean water. Some of the
Israelites despair, and they want to surrender. "Was it for want of
graves in Egypt that you brought us to die in the wilderness? What have
you done to us, taking us out of Egypt? Is this not the very thing we
told you in Egypt, saying let us be, we will serve the Egyptians, for
it's better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the
wilderness." But Moses rallies them, and then in the moment of crisis,
God intervenes on Israel's behalf.</p>

<p>Once again, source critics see in the account of the parting of the
Reed Sea, in Exodus 14 and 15, three different versions of the event
that have been interwoven. I have to stress, though, that scholars
differ very much on where the seams in the text are, what parts of the
story belong to J, or E, or P, so you'll read very, very different
accounts. There's some consensus, but a lot of disagreement. One thing
that most people do in fact agree on is that the oldest account of the
event is a poetic fragment that's found in Exodus 15, verses one to 12,
in particular. This is often referred to as the Song of the Sea, and
here the image is one of sinking and drowning in the Sea of Reeds. You
have a wind that blasts from God's nostrils, the waters stand straight
like a wall, and at a second blast, the sea then covers the Egyptians,
and they sink like a stone in the majestic waters.</p>

<p>The hymn doesn't anywhere refer to people crossing over on dry land.
It seems to depict a storm at sea, almost as if the Egyptians are in
boats, and a big wind makes a giant wave, and another wind then makes
it crash down on them. So they're swamped by these roiling waters. But
the name <i>Yam Suph</i>, Reed Sea, implies a more marsh-like setting,
rather than the open sea. John Collins, who is a professor here at the
[Yale] Divinity School, points out that this image--particularly in
poetic passages--this image of sinking in deep waters, occurs often in
Hebrew poetry [Collins 2004, 115-1190]. It occurs particularly in the
book of Psalms, where it's a metaphor for distress. In Psalm 69, the
Psalmist asks God to save him, for "waters have come up to my neck. / I
sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold. I have come into deep
waters, and the flood sweeps over me" [RSV; see note 1]. But a few
verses later it's clear that the poet isn't really drowning: this is a
metaphor for his difficult situation. "More in number than the hairs of
my head are those who hate me without cause. Many are those who would
destroy me, my enemies who accuse me falsely." So Collins suggests that
the poem in Exodus 15 is celebrating and preserving a historical memory
of an escape from or a defeat of Pharaoh, and that the drowning image
is used metaphorically, as it is elsewhere in Hebrew poetry to describe
the Egyptians' humiliation and defeat.</p>

<p>Later writers take this poetic image and fill out the allusion to
drowning in this ancient song, and compose the prose accounts in Exodus
14, in which the metaphor is literalized. According to these prose
accounts now, Pharaoh's army was literally drowned in water. But even
in the prose accounts in Exodus 14, we can see a composite of two
intertwined versions. In the material that's usually associated with P,
Moses is depicted as stretching out his staff, first to divide the
waters, which stand like a wall so that the Israelites can cross over
on dry land; and then, he holds out his staff to bring the waters
crashing down on the Egyptians. But according to one little
section--this is just verses 24 and 25 in Exodus 14; some attribute
this to J--it seems that the Egyptians were stymied by their own
chariots. The image we get there is that the Israelites are working
their way through the marsh on foot, and the Egyptians' chariot wheels
can't make it through the marsh. They get stuck in the mud, and this
forces them to give up the chase. So, the final narrative that emerges
from this long process of transmission: perhaps a core image of escape
on foot, where chariots are bogged, a poem that describes the defeat in
metaphorical terms using a drowning and sinking image, and then prose
elaboration on these previous traditions that have a very dramatic
element of the sea being parted and crashing down on the Egyptians. A
long process of transmission, interweaving, literary embellishment has
gone into the creation of this account in Exodus 14 and 15. But the
story as it stands reiterates a motif that we've seen before: that of
the threatened destruction of God's creation, or God's people, by
chaotic waters, and of divine salvation from that threat.</p>

<p>What's interesting about the Song of the Sea, this poetic fragment
in Exodus 15, is that here the Hebrews adopt the language of Canaanite
myth and apply it to Yahweh. If you still have that sheet that was
handed out before, listing different epithets for Baal, and listing
epithets for Yahweh, it would be handy to have that, or to take a look
at it later again, because the description of Yahweh is that of a storm
god in Exodus 15. He heaps up the waters with a blast of wind, like a
storm at sea, and this is reminiscent of the Canaanite storm god Baal,
as you see on your handout. Baal is said to ride on the clouds, he's a
storm god, and he's accompanied by wind and rain. At the beginning of
the rainy season, Baal opens a slit, or makes a slit in the clouds, and
thunders and shakes the Earth. In one important legend that we have
from the Canaanite texts, the Ugaritic texts, he defeats an adversary
who's known as Prince Sea, or Judge River. After he vanquishes this
watery foe, he is acclaimed the king of the gods, and the king of men,
and he is housed in a home, not a tent as El was. El was housed in a
tent, but now this Baal is housed in a permanent structure, a home that
is on top of a mountain, and is built of cedar.</p>

<p>Now, ancient Hebrew descriptions of Yahweh employ very similar
language in the poetic passage here in Exodus 15, but also in other
poetic passages. So, for example, Psalm 68:5, "Extol him who rides the
clouds, the Lord is his name," Yahweh is his name. So "Extol him who
rides the clouds, Yahweh is his name," as if to say [Yahweh] not Baal.
So Yahweh is described like Baal, as riding on the clouds. Psalm 29
also employs the language of a storm god. "The voice of the Lord is
over the waters. The God of glory thunders, the Lord, over the mighty
waters." Some scholars think this actually was originally a psalm about
Baal that was simply adopted and referred to Yahweh. Images of God
engaged in a battle with some kind of watery foe also appear in the
Psalms. Psalm 74: "O, God, my king from of old, who brings deliverance
throughout the land; it was You who drove back the sea with Your might,
who smashed the heads of the monsters in the waters;" and so on. Judges
5 is also another ancient song fragment in verses four to five. It uses
the same kind of imagery.</p>

<p>Now, Michael Coogan, who's a very important biblical scholar and an
expert in the Canaanite texts, the Ugaritic materials, has made some
intriguing observations in connection with the biblical representation
of Yahweh in terms that are so reminiscent of the storm god, Baal
[Coogan 2006, 101-3]. He notes that Baal was the key figure in a
change, a change in the religion of Canaan, that happened somewhere
between 1500 and 1200 BCE, and that is also the traditional time for
what we think of as the Exodus and the introduction of Yahwism, or the
differentiation of Yahwism. At this time, somewhere in this period,
there was a transfer of power in the Canaanite pantheon from the older
gods to younger gods. The older god El, the sky god, was replaced by
the younger storm god, Baal, and he was replaced by virtue of his
defeat of Prince Sea, or whoever this watery foe is. So El is replaced
by Baal after a defeat of some watery foe.</p>

<p>Coogan notes that about the same time, there seems to have been a
similar change in many of the world's traditions, or many of the
traditions of the region. We have a younger storm god who usurps power
from an older god by virtue of a victory over a water god. Remember
<i>Enuma Elish</i>, which we read at the very beginning of the
semester. You have the young storm god, Marduk, who defeats Tiamat, the
watery ferocious deep monster, and does so by blasting a wind into her,
and so establishes his claim to rule, instead of the old sky god, Anu.
In India, the storm god Indra about this time assumes the place of a
previous god, Dyaus. In Greece, Zeus, who is associated with a storm,
thunder--lightening bolts you think of in the hands of Zeus--he
replaces Kronos, who had been the head of the pantheon. And so here in
Exodus, we find that just as the nation of Israel is coming into
existence, just as the Israelites are making the transition from a
nomadic existence to a more settled way of life ultimately in their own
land, there seems to be a collective memory of a similar change in her
religion. Like the storm gods in the myths of Israel's neighbors,
Yahweh heaps up the waters with a blast of wind. He wins a stunning
victory, he establishes himself as the god of the Israelites in place
of El, who was worshipped by Israel's patriarchs, remember. And like
the Canaanite god, Baal, Yahweh, as we will see as we continue to read
the text, will eventually want a house for himself atop a mountain,
Mount Zion, and it will be lined with cedar.</p>

<p>There are of course, important ways in which Israel's use of the
storm god motif diverges from that of other Ancient Near Eastern
stories. The most important is that Yahweh's battle is a historic
battle, rather than a mythic battle. The sea is not Yahweh's opponent,
nor is Yahweh's enemy another god. Yahweh is doing battle here with a
human foe, the Egyptian pharaoh and his army. The sea is a weapon
deployed. It's a weapon in the divine arsenal, and it's deployed on
behalf of Israel, but, again, Yahweh is depicted by the biblical writer
as transcending nature, using forces of nature for a historical
purpose, acting in history to deliver his people, and create a new
nation, Israel. So just as in Genesis 1, the universe is created when
the wind of God parts the primeval waters, so in Exodus 14 and 15, a
new nation is created when the wind of God parts the waters of the Reed
Sea. But to describe what was understood to be a historic event, a one
time event, not a recurring mythical event, but a historic event, the
ancient Israelites employed language and images drawn naturally from
the traditions and myths of their broader cultural context, or I should
say, [traditions and myths] that were the cultural context in which
they themselves existed, while at the same time differentiating
themselves to some degree.</p>

<p>Now, as has long been noted, the Exodus event became the paradigm of
God's salvation of his people, and when I say salvation, I don't mean
that in the later Christian sense of personal salvation from sin.
That's a notion that's anachronistically read back into the Hebrew
Bible. It's not there. Salvation in the Hebrew Bible does not refer to
an individual's deliverance from a sinful nature. This is not a concept
we find in the Hebrew Bible. It refers instead, to the concrete,
collective, communal salvation from national suffering and oppression,
particularly in the form of foreign rule or enslavement. When biblical
writers speak of Yahweh as Israel's redeemer and savior, they are
referring to Yahweh's physical deliverance of the nation from the hands
of her foes. We're going to see this increasingly as we move to the
prophetic material.</p>

<p>So the exodus is a paradigm for salvation, but it would be a
mistake, I think, to view the Exodus as the climax of the preceding
narrative. We've gotten to this point now: we had this big dramatic
scene at the Reed Sea, but the physical redemption of the Israelites is
not in fact the end of our story. It's a dramatic way-station in a
story that's going to reach its climax in the covenant that will be
concluded at Sinai, and as many sensitive readers of the Bible have
noted, the road from Egypt leads not to the other side of the Reed Sea,
but on to Sinai. God's redemption of the Israelites is a redemption for
a purpose, a purpose that doesn't become clear until we get to Sinai,
for at Sinai the Israelites will become God's people, bound by a
covenant. And so the story continues. In the third month, after the
Exodus, the Israelites arrive at the wilderness of Sinai, and they
encamp at the mountain where Moses was first called by God, the text
says. The covenant concluded at Sinai is referred to as the Mosaic
covenant. So this is now our third covenant that we have encountered;
we will have one more coming. And the Mosaic covenant differs radically
from the Noahide and the Abrahamic or patriarchal covenants that we've
already seen, because here God makes no promises beyond being the
patron or protector of Israel; and also, in this covenant, he sets
terms that require obedience to a variety of laws and commandments. So
the Mosaic covenant is neither unilateral--this is now a bilateral
covenant, [involving] mutual, reciprocal obligations--nor is it
unconditional like the other two. It is conditional. So this is our
first bilateral, conditional covenant. If Israel doesn't fulfill her
obligations by obeying God's Torah, his instructions, and living in
accordance with his will, as expressed in the laws and instructions,
then God will not fulfill his obligation of protection and blessing
towards Israel.</p>

<p>Now, the biblical scholar Jon Levenson, here, maintains that
historical critical scholarship has been unkind to biblical Israel,
because of a pervasive bias between the two main foci of the religion
of ancient Israel [Levenson 1995, Introduction]. Those are (1) the
Torah, or the law-- understood as the law--not a great translation, I
prefer instruction, but Torah, taken to mean the law on the one hand;
and, (2) the temple on the other. He says that, on the one hand,
negative stereotypes rooted in Paul's condemnation of Mosaic law as a
deadening curse from which belief in Jesus offers liberation--that
account colors scholarly accounts of the giving of the Torah. On the
other hand, a Protestant distaste for priest-centered cultic ritual
colors scholarly accounts of the temple, and its meaning for ancient
Israelites. These biases are so much embedded in our culture, he says,
they permeate the work of even secular scholars of the Bible, so that a
negative view of the law affects interpretation of the book of Exodus.
Scholars tend to place great emphasis on the deliverance from Egypt as
the high point in the Exodus narrative, rather than the more natural
literary climax, which is the conclusion of the covenant at Mount
Sinai, and the delivery of the Torah. So Levenson, in his book <i>Sinai
and Zion</i>, tries to correct this prejudicial treatment. He says he
seeks to give the two central institutions of Torah on the one hand,
and Temple on the other, a fair hearing.</p>

<p>So in his book, <i>Sinai and Zion</i>, Levenson explores what he
calls the two great mountain traditions that express these central
concepts: the tradition of Mount Sinai--that's where Israel received
the Torah, and entered into this defining covenantal relationship with
God--and then on the other hand, the tradition of Mount Zion. Zion will
be the future site of the nation's holy temple in Jerusalem. Mount Zion
is in Jerusalem, it's the Temple Mount today where the [El-Aqsa] mosque
now is. Today, we'll consider Levenson's analysis of the Sinai
tradition as an entrée into the Israelite concept of the Torah, and the
covenant bond, its meaning and its implications.</p>

<p>Levenson stresses the importance of the covenant formulary. There
are Ancient Near Eastern parallels to the Sinai covenant of the
Bible--especially Hittite treaties that date 1500 to 1200, or so; also
Assyrian treaties in about the eighth century, but they are in many
ways continuous with what you find in the Hittite treaties--treaties
between a suzerain and vassal. Remember we talked about two types of
treaties: suzerainty treaties and parity treaties. Parity treaties
[are] between equals, but suzerainty treaties are between a suzerain,
who has a position obviously of power and authority, and a vassal. He
details the following six elements, which I hope you can all see [on
the board], especially in the Hittite treaties. They're not all found
in every treaty, but they're often enough found that we can speak of
these six elements.</p>

<p>First there is a preamble. That's found in every one. The suzerain
identifies himself. Second of all, there's generally an account of the
historical circumstances that are leading to the treaty: so some kind
of historical prologue. Then we usually have some sort of set of
stipulations and requirements, upon the vassal generally. Fourth,
there's generally some arrangement, either for the publication of the
treaty, or its deposition, its safe-keeping in some sort of shrine.
There is generally a concluding invocation of witnesses, usually the
gods are invoked as witnesses to a binding oath, some kind of
covenantal oath that brings the treaty into effect, and it's witnessed
by gods. Lastly, there will be very often a list of blessings for the
party who obeys, and curses for the party that violates the pact. The
curses are particularly emphasized in the Assyrian treaties.</p>

<p>Levenson then identifies many of these elements in Yahweh's very
first speech to Moses. Moses and the Israelites arrive at Sinai, in
Exodus 19, and God says the following in verses 3b to 8:<br />
</p>

<blockquote>The Lord called to him from the mountain, saying, "Thus
shall you say to the house of Jacob and declare to the children of
Israel: 'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, how I bore you on
eagles' wings and brought you to Me. Now then, if you will obey Me
faithfully and keep My covenant, you shall be My treasured possession
among all the peoples. Indeed, all the earth is Mine, but you shall be
to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words that
you shall speak to the children of Israel."<br />
<br />
Moses came and summoned the elders of the people and put before them
all that the Lord had commanded him. All the people answered as one,
saying, "All that the Lord has spoken we will do!" And Moses brought
back the people's words to the Lord.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So Levenson, who draws actually on long-standing work by other
scholars, and earlier in the twentieth century even [see note 2],
Levenson finds several of the main elements of the Hittite suzerainty
treaties in this speech. So verse 4, "You've seen what I did to the
Egyptians, how I bore you on eagles' wings," is the historical
prologue. That's the reason that we're in the situation we're in now,
and making this covenant. Verse 5 contains God's stipulations. It's a
very general condition--"If you obey my laws." Basically, keep my
covenant, obey me faithfully, that's the conditional. That's going to
be filled out and articulated at great length in the subsequent
chapters when all the laws they have to obey are spelled out. The
second half of verse 5 and 6 gives the reward: God is conferring on the
Israelites this elevated status of royalty, of priesthood; "You'll be
to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation." In verse 8, the people
solemnly undertake to fulfill the terms of the covenant, so we have at
least three of the steps that we find in the Hittite treaties, as
well.</p>

<p>If we take a broader view of the full biblical account of Israel's
covenant with God, all six elements can be identified in the biblical
narrative. They're scattered throughout the text, however. We have the
preamble, and the historical background to the covenant in God's
summary introduction to the people in Exodus 20: "I am Yahweh who
brought you out of the land of Egypt." It sums it all up: introduction,
who I am, and why we are historically connected. So this fact of God's
bringing Israel out of Egypt, presumably establishes God's claim to
sovereignty. The terms of the treaty are then stipulated at great
length in the instructions that are found in Exodus chapter 20 through
chapter 23. Moses reads the book of the covenant--it's called the
Scroll of the Covenant--publicly: this is said in Exodus 24:7. In
Deuteronomy we read that it will be deposited for safekeeping in a
special ark. The Israelites vow that they'll obey [in] Exodus 24:3,
also 7b. The covenant is then sealed by a formal ritual. In this case
it's a sacrifice in Exodus 24:8. In a monotheistic system you can't
really call upon other gods to be witnesses to the sealing of the oath,
so we have heaven and earth being invoked as witnesses--Deuteronomy
4:26; Deuteronomy 30:19; 31:28--heaven and earth, the idea being
perhaps the inhabitants thereof should witness. As for blessings and
curses, we have a long list of each found in Leviticus 26, and
Deuteronomy 28, also interesting reading. Some of these curses,
particularly the ones in Deuteronomy bear a very striking resemblance
to curses in an Assyrian treaty that we have that dates to about 677
BCE [from] the Assyrian king Esarhaddon--and many of the curses are
really almost word for word. So while no one passage contains all of
the elements of the Hittite treaty form, there are enough of them
scattered around to suggest it as a model, as well as its later
instantiation in Assyrian culture.</p>

<p>So what's the meaning of this? Why does it matter that Israel
understands its relationship with God, and uses the covenant as a
vehicle for expressing its relationship with God, the vehicle of the
suzerainty treaty? According to Levenson, the use of a suzerainty
treaty as a model for Israel's relationship to Yahweh, expresses
several key ideas. It captures several key ideas. First, the historical
prologue that's so central to the suzerainty treaty, grounds the
obligations of Israel to Yahweh in the history of his acts on her
behalf. So it's grounded in a historical moment, and we'll come back to
this and what that might mean about her perception of God. Second, the
historical prologue bridges the gap between generations. Israel's past
and present and future generations form a collective entity, Israel,
that collectively assents to the covenant. And even today, at Passover
ceremonies everywhere, Jews are reminded to see themselves, they're
reminded of the obligation to see themselves as if they personally came
out of Egypt, and personally covenanted with God.</p>

<p>The historical prologue, thirdly, explains why Israel accepts her
place in the suzerain-vassal relationship. Israel's acceptance of a
relationship with God doesn't stem from mystical introspection, or
philosophical speculation, Levenson says. Instead the Israelites are
affirming their identity and their relationship with God by telling a
story, a story whose moral can only be that God is reliable. Israel can
rely on God, just as a vassal can rely on his suzerain. The goal is
not, Levenson says, ultimately the affirmation of God's suzerainty in a
purely verbal sense. The point is not mere verbal acclaim of God as
suzerain. Levenson points out that the affirmation of God's suzerainty
is rendered in the form of obedience to commandments, not mere verbal
acclamation. Observance of God's commandments is, as Levenson puts it,
the teleological end of history. Why is that important? Unless we
recognize that the road from Egypt leads inextricably to Sinai, that
the story of national liberation issues in and is subordinate to, is
ultimately subordinate to, the obligation to God's covenantal
stipulations and observance of his laws, then we run the risk of doing
what has been done for some centuries now: of reading Exodus as first
and foremost a story of a miraculous delivery, rather than the story of
a relationship, which is expressed through obligations to the
observance of specific laws, commandments, and instructions.</p>

<p>The suzerain-vassal model has further implications. Levenson and
other scholars, point many of these out. Just as the Ancient Near
Eastern suzerainty treaties specified that vassals of a suzerain are to
treat other vassals of the suzerain well, Israelites are bound to one
another then as vassals of the same suzerain, and are to treat one
another well. So covenant in Israel becomes the basis of social ethics.
It's the reason that God gives instructions regarding the treatment of
one's fellow Israelites. So the suzerain-vassal relationship grounds
the social ethic within Israel.</p>

<p>Also, just as a vassal cannot serve two suzerains--that's pretty
explicit in all the treaties, you owe exclusive service to your
suzerain--so the covenant with God entails the notion of Israel's
exclusive service of Yahweh. The assertion is not that there is no
other god, but that Israel will have no other god before Yahweh. The
jealousy of the suzerain is the motivation for prohibitions against
certain intimate contacts with non-Yahweh peoples, because these
alliances will end up entailing recognition of the gods of these
peoples. The covenant with Yahweh will also, we shall see soon,
preclude alliances with other human competitors. If Israel serves a
divine king, she can't, for example, serve a human king, and that's an
idea that will express itself in biblical texts, as we'll see, that are
clearly opposed to the creation of a monarchy in Israel. Not everyone
was onboard with the idea that Israel should be ruled by a king. So
there are texts that will object to the creation of the monarchy of
King Saul, and King David, and so on. There are also texts that are
going to object to alliances with any foreign king, or subservience to
any foreign king, whether it's Egypt or Assyria or Babylonia. So
subservience to a human king, native or foreign, is in these texts
considered a rejection of the divine kingship, which is the ideal--the
exclusive kingship of Yahweh--and it's seen as a breach of the
covenant.</p>

<p>Now, Ancient Near Eastern suzerainty models also speak repeatedly of
the vassal's love for the suzerain. Vassal so-and-so will love the
Assyrian lord so-and-so, and that's an element that is not absent at
all in the biblical texts that deal with the covenant bond. The
Israelites promise to serve and to love Yahweh. That's an additional
theme that's associated regularly with the covenant. It's one that
we'll take up in greater detail, though, when we get to the book of
Deuteronomy, where it is stressed to a greater degree than it is in
Exodus, but for now, we can accept Levenson's claim that Sinai
represents an intersection of law and love, because of the use of the
suzerainty model.</p>

<p>So the covenant concept is critical to the Bible's portrayal and
understanding of the relationship between God and Israel. The entire
history of Israel, as portrayed by biblical writers, is going to be
governed by this one outstanding reality of covenant. Israel's fortunes
will be seen to ride on the degree of its faithfulness to this
covenant.</p>

<p>The book of Exodus closes, with the construction of the sanctuary,
and when the sanctuary is completed, the text says the presence of the
Lord filled the tabernacle. This is a sign of divine approval. The long
section where we have the receipt of the instructions for the building
of the temple, and then we have an actual account of those instructions
being fulfilled, not the temple, tabernacle, excuse me: it's just a
tent structure at this stage--so receiving the instructions and then
the actual construction of the tabernacle, that extends from Exodus 25
to the end of the book, Exodus 40; but it's interrupted in Exodus 32 by
the account of the Israelites' apostasy with the golden calf, which is
a great and very ambiguous story. The moment of Israel's greatest glory
is to be the moment of her greatest shame.</p>

<p>As Moses receives God's covenant on Mount Sinai--he's there at the
top of Sinai communing with God-- the Israelites who are encamped at
the foot of the mountain grow restless, and rebellious, and they demand
of Aaron a god, because they don't know what's become of "this fellow
Moses." They say: what about this guy, Moses? They use a very
colloquial kind of term to dismiss him. So Aaron, feeling the heat,
makes a golden calf, and the people bow down to it, and someone
declares, "This is your God, oh Israel, who brought you out of the land
of Egypt." Well, an enraged God tells Moses: You know what's going on
down there? And he tells him to descend from the mountain. The people
are sinning, they've already gone astray, and he says: I'm through. I
want to destroy the nation, and I'm going to start a new nation again
from you, Moses. Moses manages to placate God momentarily, and then he
turns around to face the people. He comes down from the mountain, he
approaches the camp, he's stunned by what he sees. He's carrying the
tablets, the instructions, and then he smashes them at the foot of the
mountain in fury. He manages to halt the activities. He punishes the
perpetrators, he has a few choice words for Aaron. This temporary
alienation from God is ultimately repaired through Moses' intense
prayer and intercession. It actually takes several chapters to reach a
resolution, and God pouts for quite a while, but a renewal of the
covenant does occur, and another set of stone tablets is given, and
according to one rabbinic text the broken tablets, as well as the new
tablets, are both placed in the ark [see note 3].</p>

<p>And this embarrassing episode is just the beginning of a sequence of
embarrassing events that will occur as the Israelites move from Egypt
towards the land that's been promised to them. Most of these episodes
will occur in the book of Numbers, and they involve the rebellion of
the people in some way, generally God's fury in reaction to that
rebellion, Moses' intervention usually on behalf of the people, and
God's appeasement. The book of Numbers recounts the itinerary of the
Israelites throughout the 40 years of their wanderings and encampments
around the sacred tabernacle. The tabernacle always moves in the center
of the tribes, and they're positioned in certain specific positions
around the tabernacle as they move. They stay at Sinai for a year, I
believe, in the text, before they begin their movement, and Numbers
contains some law, and much narrative material. The material tells of
God's provision for the people in the desert, but it also tells of the
Israelites' constant complaining, and rebellion. The Israelites rebel
against Moses and God, and they long for Egypt. There are several times
when God threatens to exterminate them, but Moses manages to dissuade
him.</p>

<p>In Numbers 14, for example, when the Israelites complain again, God
is determined to destroy them, and Moses intervenes, and the
intervention leads to a compromise. God swears that none of the adults
who witnessed the Exodus -- with the exception of Joshua and Caleb, who
did not join in the rebellion -- none of the adults who witnessed the
Exodus would see the fulfillment of God's salvation, and enter the
Promised Land. This means the Israelites will have to wander for 40
years in the desert until all of those who left Egypt as adults pass
away, leaving a new generation that hasn't really tasted slavery, to
enter the land and form a new nation.</p>

<p>The book of Numbers, I think, is most remarkable for the
relationship that it describes between Moses and God. I love reading
these particular stories, and just hearing the dialogue between them,
and imagining it, because the two of them alternate in losing patience
with the Israelites, and wishing to throw them over. But each time the
one convinces the other to be forbearing. The relationship between
Moses and God is a very intimate one, very much like a husband and
wife, who are working together as partners and parenting a difficult
child. They're partners in the preparation of Israel for their new
life, readying Israel for life in God's land as a nation, as a people.
I'm going to just give you two examples of the way Moses and God act as
a check upon each other. The first excerpt is from Numbers 14, and it
shows Moses' ability to placate the wrath of God. Now, in this story,
the Israelites express great fear. They've just heard a report from a
reconnaissance team that scoped out the land, and they come back and
say: Oh, boy, you know, it looks really bad--and that they think that
the chances of conquering the Promised Land are very, very slim.</p>

<blockquote>The whole community broke into loud cries, and the people
wept that night. All the Israelites railed against Moses and Aaron. "If
only we had died in the land of Egypt," the whole community shouted at
them, "or if only we might die in this wilderness! Why is the Lord
taking us to that land to fall by the sword? Our wives and children
will be carried off! It would be better for us to go back to Egypt!"
And they said to one another, "Let us head back for Egypt."<br />
<br />
… the Presence of the Lord appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the
Israelites.<br />
<br />
And the Lord said to Moses, "How long will this people spurn Me, and
how long will they have no faith in Me despite all the signs that I
have performed in their midst? I will strike them with pestilence and
disown them, and I will make of you a nation far more numerous than
they!" But Moses said to the Lord, "When the Egyptians, from whose
midst You brought up this people in Your might, hear the news, they
will tell it to the inhabitants of that land…. If then You slay this
people to a man, the nations who have heard Your fame will say, 'It
must be because the Lord was powerless to bring that people into the
land He had promised them on oath that He slaughtered them in the
wilderness.' Therefore, I pray, let my Lord's forbearance be… abounding
in kindness; forgiving iniquity and transgression…. Pardon, I pray, the
iniquity of this people according to Your great kindness, as You have
forgiven this people ever since Egypt."<br />
<br />
And the Lord said, "I pardon, as you have asked…."</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So note God's offer to start all over again with Moses. This is a
pattern with this god, you know--create, gets upset, a flood wipes them
out, let's start again, oh, still not too good, let's choose one
person, Abraham, see how that goes; oh, disappointed, let's go with
Moses--so this is a bit of a pattern. But Moses refuses to accept the
offer, and instead he defends the Israelites, and he averts their
destruction. He appeals primarily to God's vanity: What will the
neighbors think if you destroy them? They'll think you couldn't fulfill
your promise. They'll think you're not the universal God of history.
But the roles are reversed in the following passage, and this is where
the text blows hot and cold. In fact, there's a rabbinic image, there's
a rabbinic tradition that talks about this period of time, and has God
and Moses talking, and God says: Listen, between the two of us,
whenever I blow hot, you blow cold, or when I pour hot water, you pour
cold, and when you pour hot, I'll pour cold, and together we'll muddle
through, and get through here. The Israelites won't be wiped out. But
in this next passage, which is Numbers 11, Moses is the one who is
impatient with the Israelites' constant complaints and lack of faith,
and he's ready to throw in the towel. I'll just read this last
passage.</p>

<blockquote>The riffraff in their midst felt a gluttonous craving; and
then the Israelites wept and said, 'If only we had meat to eat! We
remember the fish that we used to eat free in Egypt<br />
<br />
Okay, we were slaves, but the food was free, you know? I just love that
line. We used to eat this fish free in Egypt.<br />
<br />
 …the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic. Now
our gullets are shriveled. There is nothing at all! Nothing but this
manna to look at!'<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
Moses heard the people weeping, every clan apart, each person at the
entrance of his tent. The Lord was very angry, and Moses was
distressed. And Moses said to the Lord, "Why have You dealt ill with
Your servant [me], and why have I not enjoyed Your favor, that You have
laid the burden of all this people upon me? Did I conceive all this
people, did I bear them, that You should say to me, 'Carry them in your
bosom as a nurse carries an infant,' to the land that You have promised
on oath to their fathers? Where am I to get meat to give to all this
people, when they whine before me and say, 'Give us meat to eat!' I
cannot carry all this people by myself, for it is too much for me. If
You would deal thus with me, kill me rather, I beg You, and let me see
no more of my wretchedness!"<br />
<br />
Then the Lord said to Moses, "Gather for Me seventy of Israel's elders
of whom you have experience as elders and officers of the people, and
bring them to the Tent of Meeting and let them take their place there
with you. I will come down and speak with you there, and I will draw
upon the spirit that is on you and put it upon them; they shall share
the burden of the people with you, and you shall not bear it
alone.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So again, hot and cold. And in many ways, Moses sets the paradigm
for the classical prophet. He performs this double duty. He chastises
and upbraids the Israelites for their rebellion and failures. When he's
turning and facing the people, he's on their case. But at the same
time, he consoles the people when they fear they've driven God away
irreparably, and when he turns to face God, he defends the people
before God. He pleads for mercy when they do in fact deserve
punishment--and he knows they deserve punishment. He even says as much,
but please [he says] have mercy. At times he expresses his frustration
with the difficulty of his task, and resentment that it's been assigned
to him. But we'll consider the character and the role of Moses in much
greater detail when we reach the book of Deuteronomy next Monday.</p>

<p>For the coming week, I would like you to please pay particular
attention: we're dealing with two topics that will be, I think perhaps
for some of you, a little different, new, alien. We're going to be
dealing with biblical law on Monday, and biblical ritual, purity text,
holiness, temple, on Wednesday. These are worlds apart from many of the
things we know, so please, there's a lot of textual reading to do for
Monday and Wednesday. Please do it carefully, and I might even hand out
a little bit of a study guide to help you with that.</p>
