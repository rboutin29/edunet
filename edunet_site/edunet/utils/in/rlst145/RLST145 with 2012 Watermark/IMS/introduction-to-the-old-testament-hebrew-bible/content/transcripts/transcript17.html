<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> We're going to move on now to our
second literary prophet and this is the prophet Hosea. He was a native
of the northern kingdom. So Amos and Hosea you're going to associate
with the Assyrian crisis and they are prophets of the northern kingdom
of Israel. He's prophesying in the time of Jeroboam II. Jeroboam
reigned until about 747. And then he continues to the last king who is,
confusingly, named Hosea. So he prophesies in the 740s, '30s, '20s,
somewhere in there. He doesn't seem to have seen the fall of Israel
though. Now, Hosea is considered by many to be the most difficult of
the prophetic books. The Hebrew is very difficult and it sometimes
seems rather garbled. It's very hard to render it intelligibly.</p>

<p>But structurally, we can divide the book into two main sections.
Chapters 1 to 3 have a certain coherence to them, and then chapters 4
through 14. 1 to 3 tells of the prophet's marriage to a promiscuous
woman named Gomer. His marriage is a metaphor for Israel's relationship
with God. And these chapters also contain an indictment or a lawsuit.
Remember this <i>riv</i> form, lawsuit form. We're going to see it both
in Hosea and Isaiah today. Then chapters 4 through 14 contain oracles
primarily, oracles against the nations but also against the Kingdom of
Israel. We're going to be focusing primarily on chapters 1 to 3 since
these are so distinctive to Hosea and we'll refer occasionally to some
of the other chapters where they might pronounce an important theme for
Hosea.</p>

<p>So again, the historical background for the Book of Hosea is the
Assyrian threat. The Assyrians are wiping out a number of the smaller
states in the Ancient Near East in the middle of the eighth century.
And Israel obviously could not be far behind. The line that was taken
by Hosea was to condemn the attempts that were made by various kings,
by Israel's kings, to withstand defeat or to avoid defeat at the hands
of Assyria. If Assyria was going to conquer Israel, Hosea said, then it
was God's just punishment. And to fight against it, to fight against
the inevitable was simply another kind of rejection of God, another
rejection of his plans and purpose. It demonstrated a lack of trust or
faith in the power of God. Hosea 10:13 spells out the disastrous
consequences of trusting in human power or foreign alliances rather
than trusting in God. And this is a theme that we'll see occurring
again and again. Hosea 10:13, "You have plowed wickedness, / you have
reaped iniquity-- / [And] you shall eat the fruits of treachery-- /
Because you relied on your way, / On your host of warriors." He was
suggesting inaction. Now, that surely would have been viewed by the
king and the court as against all reason. But this was Hosea's
insistence. Israel was faced with a choice. In whom should she place
her trust? In God, or in human leaders and their armies?</p>

<p>Hosea 1:7 goes so far as to suggest that actually the moment of
decision has past for the northern kingdom. There's still some hope for
the southern kingdom, but the northern kingdom has obviously made its
choice and it was the wrong choice. Hosea says that God says,</p>

<blockquote>"â€¦I will no longer accept the house of Israel or pardon
them. (But I will accept the House of Judah. And I will give them
victory through the Lord their God;" -- a victory through the Lord
their God. "I will not give them victory with bow and sword and battle,
by horses and riders."</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>If you think that's what gives you victory you're mistaken. Some see
that verse as perhaps a later interpolation into Hosea; it has such a
positive assessment of the southern kingdom. But there is this sense of
impending disaster that resonates throughout the Book of Hosea. Chapter
8:7, "They sow wind, / And they shall reap whirlwind-- / Standing
stalks devoid of ears / And yielding no flour. / If they do yield any,
Strangers shall devour it. / Israel is bewildered;" So the catastrophe
is unavoidable, and Hosea's often been described as painting a portrait
of unrelieved gloom. He's very grim. He seems to hold out no real hope
for Israel. She has to pay the price for her infidelity to God.</p>

<p>But we need to look a little more closely at some of the themes of
the book before we accept that evaluation entirely. And I think the one
overarching theme that helps us organize most of the material in the
Book of Hosea, and one that shows its deep indebtedness to or
interconnectedness with the Book of Deuteronomy, is the theme of
covenant, particularly Deuteronomy's notion of covenant. So I put
covenant at the top there and we see this theme being played out in
several different ways.</p>

<p>The first I've just discussed: as Yahweh's covenant partner--as the
vassal of the covenant partner, Yahweh, the sovereign--Israel should be
placing her confidence entirely in Yahweh. Any foreign alliance, any
alliance with Egypt against Assyria for example, is against the terms
of that covenant, that exclusive treaty between God and Israel. And she
should not be relying on her military might, but relying on the
sovereign, the suzerain. So anything short of complete trust in
Yahweh's power to save the vassal Israel is a violation of the terms of
the covenant. So we see it in the notion of its confidence, exclusive
confidence and trust in God and his power.</p>

<p>A second way in which the theme of covenant is expressed is found in
Hosea's denunciation of social injustice and moral decay, and of course
this is a theme that's common to the prophets. Here he follows Amos.
But he's now the first to couch his charge in the form of this formal
<i>riv</i>, or lawsuit, in which God is said to bring a charge against
Israel for violating the terms of the covenant, for breach of covenant.
This happens in chapter 4, the first three verses of chapter 4--Israel
is charged. And Hosea employs language that deliberately invokes the
Decalogue:</p>

<blockquote>Hear the word of the Lord,<br />
 O people of Israel!<br />
 For the Lord has a case [=a lawsuit]<br />
 against the inhabitants of this land,<br />
 Because there is no honesty and no goodness<br />
 And no obedience to God in the land.<br />
 [False] swearing, dishonesty, and murder,<br />
 And theft and adultery are rife.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Picking out key terms from the Decalogue: false swearing; murder,
theft and adultery, which of course occur in a threesome in the
Decalogue. These things are rife. "Crime follows upon crime! / For
that, the earth is withered: / Everything that dwells on it
languishes-- / Beasts of the field and birds of the sky-- / Even the
fish of the sea perish."</p>

<p>Unlike Amos, Hosea also engages in a prolonged or sustained
condemnation of Israel's religious faithlessness, which is figured in
terms of adultery. And so here again, the theme of covenant is dominant
and organizes the prophet's presentation. To represent Israel's
faithlessness he invokes other types of covenantal relationships as
metaphors, most notably the metaphor of marriage. Marriage can be
referred to as a <i>brit</i>, as a covenant between a husband and wife,
and so it's an appropriate metaphor. And we see it primarily in
chapters 1 through 3. He addresses the relationship between Yahweh and
Israel through the metaphor of marriage, and Israel is the unfaithful
adulterous wife. He describes, in lurid terms, her lecherous addiction
to images and idols, her adulterous worship of Baal. He points to the
nation's leaders and their failures, the kings and the priests, their
failure to prevent the peoples' waywardness, their debauchery.</p>

<p>The first chapter is reported in the third person. And this contains
God's command to Hosea to marry a promiscuous woman as a symbol of
God's own marriage with a faithless wife, Israel. "Go, get yourself a
wife of whoredom and children of whoredom; for the land will stray from
following the Lord." (1:2) So he marries this woman named Gomer and she
bears three children who have very inauspicious names. These names are
symbolic of God's anger over Israel's religious infidelity: (1)
Jezreel. Jezreel because God plans to punish Jehu for his slaughter of
the house of Ahab. Even though Ahab was no favorite of God, you still
should not raise your hand against the Lord's anointed. And so Jehu
will have to be--Ahab will have to be avenged. Jehu will have to be
punished at Jezreel, which is where the murder happened. (2)
Lo-ruhamah, which means "not loved, not forgiven," because God will no
longer love or forgive or pardon the House of Israel and (3) the third
child's name is Lo-ammi , "not my people," a sign that God has
dissolved the covenant bond. He's rejected Israel as his
people--divorced Israel. There really could be no more stark and
shocking denial of the covenant than this.</p>

<p>Chapter 3 contains a first person (Hosea's first-person) account of
God's command to him. There it's said that God commands him to
befriend, although he seems to hire, a woman on condition that she not
consort with others. The woman, again, symbolizes Israel, who's brought
into an exclusive relationship that requires her to remain faithful to
one party in contrast to her customary behavior. And then sandwiched
between chapter 1 and chapter 3, both of which have the accounts of
these relationships that are metaphors for God and Israel's
relationship--sandwiched between them is the almost schizophrenic
chapter 2. It contains, again, this sustained violent, very violent
account of the faithless wife, of faithless Israel and God's formal
declaration of divorce. "She is not my wife and I am not her husband."
This would effect a divorce, this statement uttered by a husband. We
have that in verse 4. And yet, this chapter also contains a very
gentle, very loving portrait of reconciliation.</p>

<p>And it's in that portrait of reconciliation that we see another
aspect of the covenant concept emerge. An aspect that was, again, most
pronounced in the Book of Deuteronomy. As Israel's covenant partner God
loves Israel and he actually longs for her faithfulness. This steadfast
covenantal love -- one of the words that's used repeatedly is
<i>hesed</i>, but it refers to a special kind of steadfast love, loyal
love -- this covenantal love will reconcile God to wayward Israel just
as Hosea is reunited or reconciled with his faithless wife. And the
prophet imagines a return to the wilderness. God is imagining -- it
would be wonderful if we could return to the wilderness and covenant
again, and this time it would even be a permanent, an eternal marriage.
And the three children who were cast off at birth, they will be
redeemed and accepted by their father. Those are some of the ideas
contained in this passage. This is Hosea 2:16-25, the
reconciliation:</p>

<blockquote>Assuredly,<br />
 I will speak coaxingly to her<br />
 And lead her through the wilderness<br />
 And speak to her tenderly.<br />
 I will give her her vineyards from there<br />
 And the Valley of Achor as a plowland of hope.<br />
 There she shall respond as in the days of her youth,<br />
 When she came up from the land of Egypt.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>(So the period of the Exodus and wandering is romantically imagined
as, this time, of a very good and close relationship between God and
Israel.)</p>

<p>"And in that day you will call me <i>Ishi</i> and no more will you
call me <i>Baali</i>."</p>

<p>(This is a pun. Both of these words can mean my husband. <i>Ishi</i>
is "my man," a male. And <i>Baali</i> is "my Lord." Women would have
used both for their husbands. But Baal, obviously, has connotations
with the god Baal. So instead of calling me Baali, "my Baal," you will
call me Ishi, "my husband" using a word that's free of Baal
connotations.)</p>

<blockquote>"For I will remove the names of the Baalim from her
mouth,<br />
 And they shall nevermore be mentioned by name.<br />
<br />
 In that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the
field, the birds of the air, and the creeping things of the ground; I
will banish bow, sword, and war from the land. Thus I will let them lie
down in safety. And I will espouse you forever:"<br />
<br />
(back to the marriage metaphor.)<br />
<br />
â€¦<br />
<br />
 "I will espouse you with righteousness and justice,<br />
 And with goodness and mercy,<br />
 And I will espouse you with faithfulness;<br />
 Then you shall be devoted to the Lord.<br />
 In that day,<br />
 I will respond -- declares the Lord --<br />
 I will respond to the sky,<br />
 And it shall respond to the earth;<br />
 And the earth shall respond<br />
 With new grain and wine and oil,<br />
 And they shall respond to Jezreel."<br />
 [the first of the children]. "I will sow her in the land as My
own;"</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>(Jezreel was a fertile valley not just a place of war and
death.)</p>

<blockquote>"And [I will] take Lo-ruhamah [not loved] back in
favor;<br />
 And I will say to Lo-ammi, [not my people], "You are my people"<br />
 And he will respond," [You are] my God."</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>So Hosea isn't unrelievedly gloomy and grim. It does provide these
images, these very stirring images of hope and consolation and
reconciliation. Amos also held out hope in the form of a remnant that
would survive the inevitable destruction. So we need to think about the
two traditions that prophets like Amos and Hosea are drawing on in this
combined message of doom on the one hand, and hope on the other.</p>

<p>Really, what the prophets are doing is drawing on two conceptions of
covenant: the two conceptions that we saw in our study of the
Pentateuchal material and on into Samuel. On the one hand they
recognize the unconditional and eternal, irrevocable covenant that God
established with the patriarchs as well as the eternal covenant with
David, with the House of David. Those covenants were the basis for the
belief that God would never forsake his people. But on the other hand,
of course, they place emphasis on the covenant at Sinai. It's a
conditional covenant. It requires the people's obedience to moral,
religious and civil laws in the covenant code. And it threatens
punishment for their violation. So the prophets are playing with both
of these themes. Israel has violated the Sinaitic Covenant and the
curses that are stipulated by the covenant must follow: national
destruction and even exile. They will follow; they have to. But
alienation from God is not, and never will be, complete and irreparable
because of the unconditional covenant, the covenant with the
patriarchs, the covenant with the House of David. So Israel will be
God's people forever despite temporary alienation.</p>

<p>The notion of election, an act of purely undeserved or unmerited
favor and love on God's part not due in any way to a special merit of
the people undergirds the prophetic message of consolation. And Hosea
paints a very poignant and moving portrait of this special and
indissoluble love that God bears for Israel. And in doing so, he draws
on a second metaphor. So we've had the metaphor of husband and wife,
which is a kind of covenantal relationship. We also have the metaphor
of parent-son, which can also be understood in terms of a covenant with
obligations. The parent-son relationship entails loyalty and love, but
also obligation. One of the obligations that is understood to fall on
the parent is the obligation of disciplining a rebellious or ungrateful
child, while never forsaking that child. So that's a model that works
very well with the prophetic message.</p>

<p>Hosea 11:1-4, and then skipping to verses 8 through 9,</p>

<blockquote>I fell in love with Israel<br />
 When he was still a child;<br />
 And I have called [him] My son<br />
 Ever since Egypt.<br />
 Thus were they called,<br />
 But they went their own way;<br />
 They sacrifice to <i>Baalim</i><br />
 And offer to carved images.<br />
 I have pampered Ephraim,</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>--another name for Israel, right? Ephraim--</p>

<blockquote>Taking them in My arms;<br />
But they have ignored<br />
My healing care.<br />
I drew them with human ties,<br />
With cords of love;<br />
But I seemed to them as one<br />
Who imposed a yoke on their jaws,<br />
Though I was offering them foodâ€¦ How can I give you up, O
Ephraim?<br />
How surrender you, O Israel?<br />
How can I make you like Admah,<br />
Render you like Zeboiim?<br />
[other foreign places]. I have had a change of heart,<br />
All my tenderness is stirred.<br />
I will not act on My wrath,<br />
Will not turn to destroy Ephraim.<br />
For I am God, not man,<br />
The Holy One in your midst:<br />
I will not come in fury.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>You have these alternating passages of violent rejection and tender,
tender love and reconciliation. And with these alternating passages,
the prophet is able to capture or convey a passionate struggle taking
place in the heart of God. They're giving us that passionate, emotional
portrait of God. It's the struggle of a lover who's torn between his
jealous wrath and his undying love. And it's a struggle that is won
ultimately by love because God cannot let Israel go.</p>

<p>We're going to see that each of the prophets we'll look at holds
these two covenantal ideas in tension, and they will emphasize one or
the other depending on the particular situation, the particular
historical situation. Sometimes when it's a time of relative ease or
comfort, then the prophet emphasizes the violations of the Sinaitic
covenant, the punishment that will inevitably come for these
violations, and they'll downplay God's eternal commitment to his
people. But in times of despair and suffering and destruction then the
prophet may point out that violations of the covenant were the cause of
the distress but they will emphasize God's undying love for Israel and
hold out hope therefore for a better future.</p>

<p>Now, we're going to leave the northern prophets and move to southern
prophets. Isaiah is the longest prophetic book. The interpretation of
many passages in the book of Isaiah as symbolic references to Jesus
make it one of the most quoted books of the Bible by Christians. Isaiah
was a contemporary of Amos and Hosea. Second half of the eighth
century. He was active for a little bit longer period. He was active
into about the 690s, somewhere in there. But he prophesied in the
southern kingdom of Judah when the Assyrian empire threatened and
destroyed the northern kingdom (the northern kingdom falls in 722) and
then of course was threatening Judah. So he's active for over 50 years
and he counseled Judah's kings. He counsels them through two sieges.
I've listed these for you: The siege of 734, where he counsels King
Ahaz, and then the siege of 701, where he counsels his son, Hezekiah or
Hizkiah, Hezekiah.</p>

<p>I'll give you a little bit of historical background to these sieges
so you understand them, but those are the main dates that can help
orient your approach to Isaiah. We have excellent evidence, by the way,
for all of these events in the Assyrian sources, and also
archaeological finds. The archaeological finds show destruction by the
Assyrians at the places that we believe were destroyed at the times
<i>they</i> [the former] were destroyed. But this is what happened. In
734, you have the Assyrians, who at this time are under
Tiglath-Pileser, and they're extending their control through the
region. So they're coming from the northeast. First they're going to
hit Aram in Syria, and then advance on the northern kingdom of Israel.
So Aram and Israel join together in an alliance. They were trying to
resist the advancing Assyrians. Judah refused to join the alliance. The
southern kingdom refused. So in anger, Aram and Israel moved south and
lay siege to Jerusalem. So the first siege, the siege of 734 was
actually a siege of Jerusalem by the northern kingdom of Israel in
alliance with the Aramaeans. They were trying to force Judah's
cooperation in standing against Assyria. King Ahaz of Judah decided to
appeal to Assyria for help, to Tiglath-Pileser for help. He submits to
the Assyrians as a vassal. He pays tribute. We have a record of the
tribute that was paid in the Assyrian records, in 734. And this action
is condemned by the biblical writers. The Deuteronomistic historian in
Second Kings 16 condemns this action. Isaiah also condemns it.</p>

<p>So, Judah has made itself vassal to Assyria. And this is the case
until Ahaz's son Hezekiah decides that he will assert the nation's
independence. The Assyrians are angry about this. This is now after the
fall of the northern kingdom of Israel. The Assyrians are angry and
under Sennecharib they attack. They devastate many of the cities in the
countryside (and again archaeology confirms what we know from the
Assyrian records) and they advance on Jerusalem and lay siege to
Jerusalem in 701. And just as he had counseled King Ahaz, Isaiah now
counsels Hezekiah. In the end Jerusalem wasn't destroyed. Heavy tribute
was paid to the Assyrians but eventually the Assyrians did withdraw.
They were overextended to a large degree.</p>

<p>That's the general historic background. We'll come back to some of
the details in a minute. But let me first give you a sense of the
general structure of this very large book.</p>

<p>The claim that the prophetic books are anthologies, anthologies of
oracles and other materials compiled by the prophet or by his
disciples, that is to say, schools that kept a set of prophecies and
then added to those core prophecies because of their firm belief in
their continuing relevance--that portrait of the anthological nature of
prophetic books is really demonstrable in the Book of Isaiah. I've put
the basic structure up there for you. The first 11 chapters contain
memoirs. Chapter 1 sets out some of the basic themes of Isaiah but we
have a lot of first-person narrative. Then we have various oracles
against Israel. Some of this material refers to the attacks on
Jerusalem, especially the siege of 701. And there seems to be a kind of
concluding hymn in chapter 12. We then have about 11 chapters of
oracles against foreign nations (that's a form that we also saw in Amos
and Hosea -- denouncing foreign nations) from chapters 13 to 23. I'm
skipping over chapters 24 to 27. They are a little apocalypse, a sort
of mythological vision of the end of days, and that probably dates to a
much later time, the sixth century. That was the time in which the
apocalyptic genre was really developing. So we skip over that (we don't
think of that as associated with the historical Isaiah) and move on to
chapters 28 to 33. Here, we turn from oracles against foreign nations
to oracles against Judah and Israel and the relationship with Egypt.
This is a time when we're caught between these two powers -- Egypt and
Assyria. Judah is trying to figure out with whom to make alliances.
Should she cast her lot with Egypt, and so on. And these are from a
slightly later period down towards the siege of 701 and they include
accounts of Isaiah's counsel to Hezekiah in 701. 34 and 35 we'll kind
of skip over for now. These also are post-exilic insertions. And then
chapters 36 to 39 -- this is third-person, historical narrative and it
is, in fact, 2 Kings chapters 18 to 20. That material has simply been
inserted here. So, those three chapters appear here in Isaiah. It's the
story of the invasion of Sennecharib and the interactions of Isaiah and
Hezekiah during the siege in 701.</p>

<p>So I'm stopping at chapter 39 even though there are 66 chapters in
the Book of Isaiah because most scholars agree, I think this is really
a very strong consensus, that the remaining material is not the work of
Isaiah of Jerusalem. It dates to a period long after Isaiah's lifetime.
I've already mentioned the apocalypse which we think is probably from
the sixth century. That's embedded in there, chapters 24 to 27. But the
remaining material we speak of in two main sections. We refer to these
as Second Isaiah and Third Isaiah. Chapters 40 to 55, which we refer to
as Second Isaiah, assume a historical setting in which Babylon is
dominant, not Assyria. And so we see that as coming at a much later
time. Chapters 56 to 66, we refer to as Third Isaiah. This material
contains oracles that are spread throughout the eighth to the fifth
centuries. So we'll consider those on another occasion, in their proper
historical context. Right now we're looking at the material that is
most likely attributable to First Isaiah, to Isaiah of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The book also contains material that is a repetition of material
found elsewhere. I've already noted 2 Kings 18 to 20 appears here. But
in addition, you have snatches of verses that appear in other places.
So Isaiah 2:2-4, are found in Micah, the Book of Micah 4:1-4. Jeremiah
48 is essentially equivalent to Isaiah 15 and 16. So this kind of
repetition among or between different books illustrates, again, the
anthological nature of the prophetic corpus--that these were works that
were compiled from material that sometimes circulated in more than one
school.</p>

<p>So if we turn now to the major themes of Isaiah, let's note first
the common ground between Isaiah and the prophets Amos and Hosea that
we've already discussed. Isaiah is consistent with Amos and Hosea in
denouncing again the social injustice and moral decay, which is the
cause of God's just and inevitable punishment. Isaiah 5 extracting from
verses 8 through 24:</p>

<blockquote>Ah,<br />
 Those who add house to house<br />
 And join field to field,<br />
 Till there is room for none but you<br />
 To dwell in the land!... Ah,<br />
 Those who chase liquor<br />
 From early in the morning,<br />
 And till late in the evening<br />
 Are inflamed by wineâ€¦ Ah,<br />
 Those whoâ€¦ vindicate him who is in the wrong<br />
 In return for a bribe,<br />
 And withhold vindication<br />
 From him who is in the right.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>He joins Amos in the assertion that cultic practice without just
behavior is anathema to God. Isaiah 1:10-17, "Hear the word of the
Lord, / You chieftains of Sodom; / Give ear to our God's instruction,
You folk of Gomorrah!" (So he's referring to his fellow countrymen as
Sodomites, or people of Sodom and Gomorrah, who, of course, were the
paragons of immoral behavior). [The text continues:]</p>

<blockquote>"What need have I of all your sacrifices?"<br />
Says the Lord.<br />
"I am sated with burnt offering of rams,<br />
And suet of fatlings,<br />
And blood of bulls;<br />
And I have no delight<br />
In lambs and he-goatsâ€¦ Your new moons and fixed seasons<br />
Fill me with loathing;<br />
They are become a burden to Me,<br />
I cannot endure them.<br />
And when you lift up your hands,<br />
I will turn My eyes away from you; Though you pray at length,<br />
I will not listen.<br />
Your hands are stained with crime--<br />
Wash yourselves clean;<br />
Put your evil doings<br />
Away from my sight.<br />
Cease to do evil;<br />
Learn to do good. Devote yourselves to justice;<br />
Aid the wronged.<br />
Uphold the rights of the orphan;<br />
Defend the cause of the widow.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>These are harsh and shocking words: I'm sick of sacrifices. I'm sick
of your festivals and holidays as long as you are, of course,
committing these terrible acts. And like Amos and Hosea, Isaiah asserts
that morality is a decisive factor in the fate of the nation. Again,
the passage that begins,</p>

<blockquote>Ah,<br />
 Those who add house to house<br />
 And join field to field,<br />
 â€¦In my hearing [said] the Lord of hosts;<br />
 Surely, great houses<br />
 Shall lie forlorn,<br />
 Spacious and splendid ones<br />
 Without occupants.<br />
 â€¦Assuredly,<br />
 My people will suffer exile<br />
 For not giving heed,<br />
 Its multitude victims of hunger<br />
 And its masses parched with thirst.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>So there are, of course, commonalties but Isaiah differs from Amos
and Hosea in this. He places far greater emphasis on the Davidic
Covenant than on the Mosaic Covenant. This is a key feature of Isaiah.
The wilderness tradition, the Exodus tradition, the covenant at Sinai,
these are so important to Amos and Hosea and are referred to by Amos
and Hosea, but they have less of an explicit influence on Isaiah's
prophecy. They're not <i>not</i> there. But they have less of an
explicit influence. Instead, Isaiah has an overriding interest in
Davidic theology, the royal ideology that centers on Zion, an ideology
that we discussed earlier. So we see this in his <i>riv</i>, his
covenant lawsuit, which focuses a little less on the violations of the
nation than it does on the failure of the kings and the leaders who
have misled the nation and who will now have to be punished as was
stipulated in the Davidic Covenant.</p>

<p>We also see it in his firm belief in the inviolability of Zion. This
is a clear doctrine with Isaiah: the inviolability of Zion. Yahweh has
a special relationship with the Davidic royal line and the Davidic
capitol, Jerusalem or Zion, and he will not let either perish. And that
belief undergirds and informs his consistent advice to the kings of
Judah. Times of great danger are opportunities to demonstrate absolute
trust in Yahweh's covenant with the line of David, with the House of
David. The king must rely exclusively on Yahweh and Yahweh's promises
to David and his city, and not on military might or diplomatic
strategies.</p>

<p>So if we look at Isaiah's dealings with King Ahaz -- the first siege
in 734 -- this is described in Isaiah, chapter 7 and 8. Isaiah, who
also has children with portentous names (this is a fad I guess among
the prophets -- his children's names are: "only a remnant will
survive," and "hasten for spoil, hurry for plunder" which indicates the
destruction and exile) -- he goes to visit the king. And his advice to
the king is: be quiet and do not fear (chapter 7:4). The crisis will
pass. 7:9: "If you will not believe, surely you shall not be
established." [RSV; see note 1] This is an evocation of Zion theology.
God is in the midst of the city. That means the Lord of Hosts is with
the people. Isaiah then offers Ahaz a sign of the truth of his
prophecy. And that is, namely, that a young woman who has conceived
will bear a son and will call him Immanuel. It's Hebrew <i>Immanu
el</i>, "God is with us." Immanu = "is with us", El. So this woman who
has conceived will bear a son and will call him Immanuel. This is in
7:14. Now, in the New Testament, Matthew, in chapter 1:22-23, takes
this verse as a prophecy of the birth of Jesus. This is based on a
Greek mistranslation of the word "young woman" as "virgin." The Hebrew
term that's used is not in fact the term for virgin, but it was
translated into the Greek with a term that can mean virgin. And
moreover, the verb that's used in the Hebrew is in the past tense. A
woman has already conceived. The birth is pending. It is imminent. This
child will be born. God will be with us.</p>

<p>The identity of the woman that Isaiah is speaking about is a matter
of some dispute. So some scholars take the verse as a reference to
Isaiah's own wife. She's already had two children with portentous names
and now she's pregnant with a third. But the others take the verse as a
reference to the king's own wife, who will bear his son Hezekiah, King
Hezekiah. There are some problems with chronology. It doesn't quite
work out that he would be the right age. But the fact is Hezekiah was a
celebrated king. He did in fact manage to keep Judah intact against the
Assyrian threat and kept Jerusalem from falling in the siege of 701.
And 2 Kings, the Book of 2 Kings, chapter 18:7, says of Hezekiah, "The
Lord was with him." God was with him. Connecting it to the name
Immanuel -- God is with us. God is with him. Very similar, very, very
similar in the Hebrew. In fact, [it] sounds the same. So in keeping
with this interpretation -- the idea that the child (who he says will
be able, in a sense, to save Judah) is the child of the king [yet] to
be born, Hezekiah -- in keeping with that, scholars see the famous
verses in Isaiah 9 as praise of King Hezekiah. These verses are verses
that announce, "for unto us a child is born" -- a wonderful counselor,
a mighty God, an everlasting father, a prince of peace, referring then
to an unending peace in which David's throne and kingdom are firmly
established. And again, these verses have also been decontextualized
and are utilized in Christian liturgies to this day, again, as if they
refer to the future birth of Jesus.</p>

<p>In any event, Ahaz doesn't heed Isaiah's call for inaction. He says
he should be doing nothing. How could any king really follow such
advice, to seek no political or military solution? And so he appeals to
Assyria for help against Aram and the northern kingdom of Israel who
are laying siege to him. And this is a disastrous development in
Isaiah's eyes.</p>

<p>If we move to the second siege in 701, we see that Isaiah really
takes a similar stance. Hezekiah tries to form an alliance with Egypt
now to stave off the Assyrian threat. And Isaiah castigates the king
and he castigates the king's men for abandoning Yahweh and relying on
the frail read of Egypt. And we find here an example of the bizarre and
demonstrative behavior of the prophet. We'll see this in many of the
prophets. We'll see it particularly in the prophet Ezekiel, but we see
it with others, where they would engage in these symbolic acts that
were meant to shock and attract attention. Isaiah paraded naked through
the streets of Jerusalem to illustrate the exile and the slavery that
would follow from this mistaken reliance on Egypt. He denounces the
political advisors who counsel the king to form an alliance with Egypt
because they are simply trusting in horses and chariots rather than
God. And Isaiah counsels differently. He says, "For the Egyptians are
man, not God, / And their horses are flesh, not spirit" (31:3). The
king should simply trust in God.</p>

<p>In the narrative account that we have of the siege of 701 that's
found in chapters 36 and 38 -- it's also duplicated in 2 Kings --
Isaiah counsels Hezekiah when the siege is underway not to capitulate
to the Assyrians. This might seem to contradict his earlier message
that Assyria was the rod of God's anger and that Hezekiah should not
resist. But in fact, there's a basic consistency to Isaiah's counsel.
Just as his earlier counsel to trust in God rather than Egypt was based
on his trust in God's promises to David, and the inviolability of the
royal city, so now his counsel to resist, not to open the doors of the
city to the Assyrians, is based on his belief that Yahweh could not
possibility intend to destroy his royal city. Isaiah 37:33-35:</p>

<blockquote>Assuredly, thus said the Lord concerning the king of
Assyria:<br />
 He shall not enter this city;<br />
 He shall not shoot an arrow at it,<br />
 Or advance upon it with a shield,<br />
 Or pile up a siege mound against it.<br />
 He shall go back<br />
 By the way he came,<br />
 He shall not enter this city--declares the Lord;<br />
 I will protect and save the city for My sake<br />
 And for the sake of my servant David.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Again, for the sake of the Davidic Covenant. And the fact that
Jerusalem did in fact escape destruction after this terrifying siege by
the Assyrians only fueled the belief--fueled the belief in the
inviolability of David's city, Zion.</p>

<p>Isaiah 6 contains a striking account of the call of Isaiah. Many of
the prophetic books will feature some passage which refers to the
prophet's initial call. And it's something we might expect to find at
the beginning of the book. So obviously, chronology is not the
organizing principle in the Book of Isaiah. But I want to draw your
attention to God's extraordinary message to Isaiah at the time of his
call or commission:</p>

<blockquote>Go, say to that people: "Hear, indeed, but do not
understand;<br />
 See, indeed, but do not grasp."<br />
 Dull that people's mind,<br />
 Stop its ears,<br />
 And seal its eyes--<br />
 Lest, seeing with its eyes<br />
 And hearing with its ears,<br />
 It also grasp with its mind,<br />
 And repent and save itself.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Well, there's a nice literary chiasm (before we get to the substance
of it) in the last line: you have "heart," "ears," and "eyes" and then
these are repeated but in reverse order, eyes, ears and heart. But in
this passage we return to the kind of bleakness that we saw in Hosea.
Destruction is inevitable. God's message via his prophet will not be
understood. And indeed, God will see to it that the people do not
understand the message. They do not heed the call to repent, do not
save themselves, and so do not escape God's just punishment.</p>

<p>It's a fascinating, if theologically difficult, passage. God tells
Isaiah to prevent the people from understanding, lest through their
understanding they turn back to God and save themselves. And again, we
see God, or perhaps his prophet, caught in the tension between God's
justice and God's mercy. As a God of justice he must punish the sins of
Israel with destruction. He indicated he would do so in the covenant
and he must be faithful to those terms. But as a God of mercy he wishes
to bring his people back. He wishes to send them a prophet to warn them
of the impending doom and urge them to repent so that he can forgive
them and announce his plan of destruction. Yet, how can he both punish
Israel and so fulfill the demands of justice, and yet save Israel and
so fulfill the demands of mercy and love? Verses 12 and 13 [correction:
meant to say verses 11-13] in chapter 6 answer this question with an
idea that we've seen a little in Amos and Hosea. When Isaiah asks how
long the people will fail to hear, fail to understand, to turn back to
God and save themselves, God replies,</p>

<blockquote>Till towns lie waste without inhabitants<br />
 And houses without people,<br />
 And the ground lies waste and desolate--<br />
 For the Lord will banish the population--<br />
 And deserted sites are many<br />
 In the midst of the land.<br />
 But while a tenth part yet remains in it, it shall repent. It shall be
ravaged like the terebinth and the oak, of which stumps are left even
when they are felled: its stump shall be a holy seed.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>So God will punish. God cannot <i>not</i> punish Israel. And so the
demands of justice will be met, and God will have upheld the terms of
the conditional Mosaic Covenant. But God will at the same time effect
the salvation of his people in the future. He has sent a prophet with a
call to return and in due time a remnant of the people -- a tenth
Isaiah says -- will understand and heed that call. They will receive
God's mercy and the covenant will be reestablished. And in this way the
demands of love and mercy will be met, and God will have been faithful
to his covenantal promise to the patriarchs and the royal House of
David. The people's delayed comprehension of the prophet's message
guarantees the operation of God's just punishment now and his merciful
salvation later.</p>

<p>While the notion of a remnant leads to the idea of a future hope, it
wasn't a very consoling message at the time. Because the prophets were
essentially saying that the current generation would all but cease to
exist. Isaiah 10:21-23,</p>

<blockquote>Only a remnant shall return,<br />
 Only a remnant of Jacob,<br />
 To Mighty God.<br />
 Even if your people, O Israel<br />
 Should be as the sands of the sea,<br />
 Only a remnant of it shall return.<br />
 Destruction is decreed;<br />
 Retribution comes like a flood!<br />
 For my Lord God of Hosts is carrying out<br />
 A decree of destruction upon all the land.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Well, we've seen that the prophet's message of destruction and
punishment and doom is very often accompanied by, often alternates
with, a message of consolation and a promise of restoration,
restoration of a purged or purified remnant in the land of Israel. This
is where the prophets differ from the Deuteronomistic historian. The
Deuteronomistic historian is more concerned with the justification of
God's actions against Israel than with painting a vivid portrait of the
time of a future restoration. But this period of restoration is
elaborately envisioned in some prophetic writings. And it even takes on
an eschatological tenor. The word "eschatology" means an account of the
end. So in some of them, this becomes an eschatological vision: that
the restoration will happen at the end of days. And the restoration
will bring about some sort of perfect end time.</p>

<p>So in Isaiah, for example, the return will be a genuine,
whole-hearted and permanent return to God. It will be the end of sin.
It will be the end of idolatry. All the nations of the earth will
recognize the Lord of history. A new epoch will open in world history.
It's an enormous transformation. And Isaiah is the first to envisage
this kind of transformation, the end of the dominion of idolatrous
nations. When God comes to Jerusalem to save the remnant of Israel and
gather in the dispersed exiles it will be a theophany, a
self-revelation of God, of worldwide scope. Isaiah 2:2-4, "In the days
to come, / The Mount of the Lord's House / Shall stand firm above the
mountains / And tower above the hills;" So this little hill -- if
you've ever been there, it's really not very big -- that the temple
stood on, will tower like some large impregnable mountain, over all
other hills and mountains,</p>

<blockquote>And all the nations<br />
Shall gaze on it with joy.<br />
And the many peoples shall go and say:<br />
"Come,<br />
Let us go up to the Mount of the Lord,<br />
To the House of the God of Jacob;<br />
That He may instruct us in His ways,<br />
And that we may walk in His paths."<br />
For instruction, [torah] will come forth from Zion,<br />
The word of the Lord from Jerusalem.<br />
Thus He will judge among the nations<br />
And arbitrate for the many peoples,<br />
And they shall beat their swords into plowshares<br />
And their spears into pruning hooks:<br />
Nation shall not take up<br />
Sword against nation;<br />
They shall never again know war.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Note the direction that Israelite thought is taking. The J source in
Genesis assumed that all humans had knowledge of Yahweh from the time
of creation. And remember that that was one of the distinctive traits
of J as opposed to P for example. They assume, however, that humans
turned from Yahweh. So Yahweh selected one nation to know him and
covenant with him. The Book of Deuteronomy accepts that Yahweh is
Israel's God. Other nations have been assigned to the worship of other
gods and that's just fine. But in classical prophecy, universal claims
are made on behalf of Yahweh. According to the prophets, God will make
himself known to all the nations, as he once did to Israel, and the
universal worship or recognition of Yahweh will be established at the
end of days. This is very different idea. And so as a consequence of
this idea, the very notion of Israel's election is transformed by the
prophets. In the Torah books, the election of Israel means simply God's
undeserved choice of Israel as the nation to know him and bind itself
in covenant to him.</p>

<p>But in the prophetic literature, Israel's election is an election to
a mission. Israel was chosen so as to be the instrument of universal
redemption, universal recognition of Yahweh. When God comes finally to
rescue the Israelites he will simultaneously reveal himself to all of
humankind. They'll abandon their idols, they'll return to him. A
messianic period of peace will follow. And eventually, we're going to
see the idea that the mission for which Israel was elected was to
become a "light unto the nations." This is a phrase that we're going to
see in other parts of Isaiah, Isaiah 49, Isaiah 51, later.</p>

<p>The royal ideology of Judah plays an important role in the
eschatological vision of Isaiah because this new peaceful righteous
kingdom is going to be restored by a Davidide. It's going to be
restored by a king from the Branch of Jesse. David's father name was
Jesse. So when you say the branch, or from the stump of Jesse, then you
are referring to a Davidide. Isaiah 11 refers to the restoration of the
Davidic line, which implies that it had been temporarily interrupted.
So Isaiah 11 may be post-exilic. It may date from a time when people
were hoping for a messiah to arise and restore the line of David.</p>

<p>Isaiah 11:1-12, 16:</p>

<blockquote>But a shoot shall grow out of the stump of Jesse,<br />
A twig shall sprout from his stock.<br />
The spirit of the Lord shall alight upon him:<br />
A spirit of wisdom and insight,<br />
A spirit of counsel and valor,<br />
A spirit of devotion and reverence for the Lord.<br />
He shall sense the truth by his reverence for the Lord:<br />
He shall not judgeâ€¦ by what his ears perceive.<br />
Thus he shall judge the poor with equit<br />
And decide with justice for the lowly of the land.<br />
He shall strike down a land with the rod of his mouth<br />
And slay the wicked with the breath of his lips.<br />
Justice shall be the girdle of his loins,<br />
And faithfulness the girdle of his waist.<br />
The wolf shall dwell with the lamb,<br />
The leopard lie down with the kid;<br />
The calf, the beast of prey, and the fatling together,<br />
With a little boy to herd them.<br />
The cow and the bear shall graze.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>(I think the bear is vegetarian, not killing the cow but eating the
grass with the cow.)</p>

<blockquote>Their young shall lie down together;<br />
 And the lion, like the ox, shall eat straw.<br />
 A babe shall play<br />
 Over a viper's hole,<br />
 And an infant pass his hand<br />
 Over an adder's den.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>The hostility, the animosity between humans and serpents or snakes
which was decreed at the fall, the expulsion from Eden, is reversed in
this end-time. This is a return to the situation in paradise. [The text
continues:]</p>

<blockquote>In all of My sacred mount<br />
 Nothing evil or vile shall be done;<br />
 For the land shall be filled with devotion to the Lord<br />
 As water covers the sea.<br />
 In that day,<br />
 The stock of Jesse that has remained standing<br />
 Shall become a standard to peoples--<br />
 Nations shall seek his counsel<br />
 And his abode shall be honored.<br />
 In that day, my Lord will apply his hand again to redeeming the other
part of his peoples from Assyria-- as also from Egypt. Pathros, Nubia,
Elam, Shinar, Hamath and the coastlandsâ€¦Thus there shall be a highway
for the other part of his people out of Assyria, such as there was for
Israel when it left the land of Egypt.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>So this new ideal Davidic king will rule by wisdom and insight and
the spirit of the Lord will "alight on him." That's a phrase that we
saw being used in the case of judges and in the case of Saul or David.
It doesn't refer to military might and strength here. It refers to
counsel and a spirit of devotion to God. And this king's reign will
begin an ingathering of the exiles of the nation and a transformed
world order.</p>

<p>So to conclude: Isaiah is typical of the prophetic reinterpretation
of the ancient covenant promises, giving Israel a hope for a better,
ideal future. And like the other prophets, he declared that the nation
was in distress not because the promises weren't true but because they
hadn't been believed. The nation's punishment was just a chastisement.
It wasn't a revocation of the promises. The prophets pushed the
fulfillment of the promises beyond the existing nation however. So only
after suffering the punishment for the present failure would a future
redemption be possible. So the national hope was maintained but pushed
off to a future day. Alright, we'll deal with some more prophetic books
when we come back. Please be sure to take the handouts in the box
[refers to Halloween candy] at the side of the room.</p>
