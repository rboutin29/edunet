<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> You may have heard that
post-biblical tradition hails Moses as ancient Israel's first and
greatest law giver; and certainly the Bible depicts Moses as receiving
law from God and conveying it to the Israelites. But clearly Moses
isn't the author or compiler of the legal traditions contained in the
Bible. Some of the individual laws we know are found in very, very,
very Ancient Near Eastern laws: they're part of an Ancient Near Eastern
legal tradition. The collections as a whole clearly date to a much
later period of time--and we're going to see that clearly when we talk
about Deuteronomy today--and they have been retrojected back to the
time of Moses. But nevertheless, Moses is the central figure in the
biblical narrative, from Exodus all the way through Numbers and into
Deuteronomy. And he's going to serve as a paradigm for Israel's leaders
to follow.</p>

<p>In the biblical view no one can look upon the face of God and live,
and yet Moses, who spoke with God "mouth to mouth," the text says, was
an exception to this rule. So why wasn't he permitted to see the
fulfillment of his labors? Why was he not permitted to enter the
Promised Land? This is a question that plagued ancient Israel, and the
Bible contains the effort of tradition to explain this great mystery,
or tragedy. When Moses asks God if he can enter the land--that's in
Deuteronomy 3:25--God refuses, and he gives his reason in Deuteronomy
32:49-52:</p>

<blockquote>You shall die on the mountain that you are about to ascend,
and shall be gathered to your kin, as your brother Aaron died on Mount
Hor and was gathered to his kin; for you both broke faith with Me among
the Israelite people, at the waters of Meribath-kadesh in the
wilderness of Zin, by failing to uphold My sanctity among the Israelite
people. You may view the land from a distance, but you shall not enter
it--the land that I am giving to the Israelite people.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So what happened at Meribath-kadesh that made God so angry? Well you
can read the story, it's in Numbers 20, the incident is described
there. But the answer is still not entirely clear, it's not clear what
Moses did that was so bad as to deserve this punishment. Perhaps it's
Moses' failure to follow God's instructions to the letter when he is
producing water for the Israelites or demanding water: perhaps that's
what angers God. But one gets the impression that the story in Numbers
20 and Deuteronomy's subsequent claim that it was something about that
story that earned Moses God's disapproval... you get the impression
that these are an attempt to explain what was probably a longstanding
tradition about a great leader who died on the east side of the river.
For that to have happened, for that death to have happened the writers
seem to surmise, he must have sinned; there must have been some
punishment for some sin.</p>

<p>After a very poignant scene in which God shows Moses the Promised
Land, from a lookout point on the east side of the Jordan River, we
then read about the death of Moses in Deuteronomy 34:</p>

<blockquote>God spoke to Moses on that same day. "Ascend this Mount
Abarim, the peak Nebo, in the land of Moab opposite Jericho, and look
at the Land of Canaan which I am giving Israel for a holding."<br />
<br />
..<br />
<br />
So Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo to the top of
Pisgah, opposite Jericho. And God showed him all the land, from Gilead
to Dan [which is in the north], and all of Naphtali and the land of
Ephraim and Manasseh, and all of Judah [in the south] to the outer
Mediterranean Sea; and the Negev [the southern wilderness]; and the
Plain of the Valley of Jericho, the Palm City, as far as Zoar [the end
of the Dead Sea].<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Then Moses the servant of God died there, in the land of Moab, as God
had said, and he buried him in the valley, in the land of Moab...but no
man knows the place of his burial, to this day. And the people of
Israel wept for Moses in the Plains of Moab for thirty days...and there
never again arose in Israel such a prophet as Moses, whom God knew face
to face, none like him for all the signs and wonders which the Lord
sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, to his household and
to all his land; none like him in respect of all the mighty power and
all the great and terrible deeds which Moses wrought in the sight of
all Israel. [Hayes translation]</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>There's no other human being in the Bible who earns such a tribute.
This is unusual for the biblical writer to speak in such glowing terms
of a human character.</p>

<p>I said that Moses becomes a paradigmatic leader in the biblical
tradition. And the force of Moses as paradigmatic leader of Israel is
apparent in the very first leader to succeed him, and that is Joshua.
Deuteronomy closes with a transfer of authority from Moses to Joshua.
So in Deuteronomy 34:9 we read, "Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with
the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the
Israelites heeded him, doing as the Lord had commanded Moses." And in
several ways Joshua's going to turn out to be a kind of carbon copy of
Moses. Moses crosses the Reed Sea, the waters stand in a heap, and the
children of Israel cross over on dry land. We'll see in connection with
Joshua that he crosses the Jordan River into the Promised Land, the
waters stand in a heap, the children of Israel cross on dry
land--that's in Joshua 3:13.</p>

<p>After crossing, the Israelites then celebrate the Passover, and that
makes a strong link then to the Exodus led by Moses, also at the time
of the first Passover. Moses had a vision of God at the burning bush.
He was told to remove his shoes, his sandals, because he was on holy
ground. Joshua is also going to have a theophany--that's a
vision--after he crosses the Jordan. He'll see a man with a drawn sword
who's the captain of the Lord's host and he tells him to remove his
shoes, he is on holy ground. Moses is the one to mediate a covenant
between God and Israel at Sinai. Joshua will mediate a renewal of the
covenant at a place called Shechem. Moses sent out spies to scout out
the land; Joshua also sent out spies to scout out the land. Moses holds
out a rod during battle in order that Israel prevail over her enemies,
and Joshua will do the same with a javelin. So these are all important
literary parallels and they signal the importance of Moses in Israelite
tradition, as the paradigmatic leader; so other leaders who are praised
will be modeled on Moses. It's said of Joshua after the Israelites
enter the Promised Land, it's said, "On that day the Lord exalted
Joshua in the sight of all Israel so that they revered him all his days
as they had revered Moses." So no greater praise can be given to an
Israelite leader than to be compared to Moses. But now we're going to
take a close look at Deuteronomy and we'll pick up with Joshua on
Wednesday.</p>

<p>So Israel's wanderings in the wilderness end on the Plains of Moab,
which is on the east bank of the Jordan River, and it's there that the
book of Deuteronomy opens. There Moses is going to deliver three long
speeches prior to the Israelites' entry into the Promised Land, and
these three speeches constitute the bulk of the book of Deuteronomy. So
Deuteronomy differs very much from the other four books of the
Pentateuch because in those books you have an anonymous narrator who
describes Yahweh as directing his words to Moses to then be conveyed to
Israel. Moses will speak to Israel on God's behalf. But in Deuteronomy
Moses is going to be speaking directly to the Israelites so that the
book is written almost entirely in the first person, whereas the first
four books of the Pentateuch are not; they are third person anonymous
narrative, narration. Here we have the bulk of the book in the first
person: direct speech.</p>

<p>Now Moshe Weinfeld--I've put his name on the board as someone who
you should associate always with the book of Deuteronomy--Moshe
Weinfeld is one of the leading scholars of Deuteronomy and he describes
the book as expressing ideology by means of a programmatic speech put
into the mouth of a great leader. That's a very common practice in
later Israelite historiography, and he says it's happening here
already. And I'll be referring quite a bit to Weinfeld's work as we
talk about Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy differs from the other books of the
Pentateuch in other significant ways. So for example, according to the
Priestly writer, Israel received its laws, its Torah, from God at Mount
Sinai. But in Deuteronomy the laws were given here on the Plains of
Moab, 40 years after Sinai, before the Israelites crossed the Jordan.
At Sinai the Israelites heard the Decalogue but the remainder of the
laws, it would seem, are delivered on the Plains of Moab.</p>

<p>We can look at the basic structure of Deuteronomy in a couple of
ways. We can do a kind of literary division, which I have on this side
of the board, according to the speeches. So to begin we have the first
speech which is a sort of introductory speech in the first four
chapters, going through 4:43. There's an introduction that gives us the
location, where the Israelites are, and also then Moses' first sermon.
Moses in this sermon is giving a historical review, and the purpose of
this historical review is didactic; he wants the Israelites to learn
something, to infer something from this review of their history from
Sinai to the present day. And in that review, as he retells the story,
which we've just been reading about in the previous books, we see his
selective choice of events, we see how he's describing things in a way
that underscores God's faithful, loyal, fulfillment of the covenantal
promise, and he's using this to urge the Israelites to do their part by
obeying God's laws.</p>

<p>The second speech extends from 4:44 through 28:6. And this also
contains a bit of a historical review, again retelling some of the
narrative of the earlier books of the Torah and again giving us an
insight into this phenomenon of inner biblical interpretation, or parts
of the Bible that review parts elsewhere [and] are already beginning to
interpret and present that material in a particular light. But then we
have a central section of laws being presented, beginning at about 12;
so this is still part of Moses' second speech, but stretching from
Deuteronomy 12 through 26 we have laws, and this is in many ways a
repetition of much of the revealed legislation we've already
encountered. That central portion of laws, 12 through 26, is thought to
be the earliest core of the book. We're going to come back and talk
about that in a moment.</p>

<p>Now the Greek title for this book, which is Deuteronomy, <i>deutero
nomos</i>, a second law, a repetition of the law, and that name derives
from the fact that the bulk of the book contains this legal core of
material which reviews the law. In Chapter 27 we have a covenant
renewal ceremony. It takes place on a mountain near Shechem after the
Israelites have crossed the Jordan. It describes the ceremony that will
take place, excuse me, after they have crossed the Jordan. And from
ancient Greece we know that in the ancient world settlers who would
colonize a place, particularly if they colonized a place at divine
instigation, they would perform certain ceremonies that would be
accompanied by blessings and accompanied by curses. They would write
the laws on stone pillars, they would erect an altar for sacrifices,
they would proclaim blessings and curses for those who obey and
disobey--very similar to what happens in chapter 27; all of these
elements appear in chapter 27.</p>

<p>Chapter 28 lists the material rewards that will accrue to Israel if
she is faithful to God's law, and the punishments if she should
disobey--and some of these are very creative. But the importance of the
Deuteronomist's view of history in which Israel's fate is totally
conditioned on her obedience to the covenant--this is something that
will occupy us repeatedly at a future date. I mention it here but it's
something we will need to come back to. The third speech of Moses is in
Chapters 29 and 30. This speech emphasizes the degree to which evil
fortune is the responsibility of the community. Moses enumerates
additional misfortunes and sufferings that will befall Israel if she
sins. But he emphasizes the choice is Israel's: God has been clear
regarding what's required, and it's not beyond Israel's reach to attain
life and prosperity. She needs to only choose. And this is all set out
in a speech in Chapter 30. I'll read from verses 11 to 20:</p>

<blockquote>Surely, this Instruction which I enjoin upon you this day
is not too baffling for you, nor is it beyond reach. It is not in the
heavens, that you should say, "Who among us can go up to the heavens
and get it for us and impart it to us, that we may observe it?" Neither
is it beyond the sea, that you should say, "Who among us can cross to
the other side of the sea and get it for us and impart it to us, that
we may observe it?" No, the thing is very close to you, in your mouth
and in your heart, to observe it.<br />
<br />
See, I set before you this day life and prosperity, death and
adversity. For I command you this day, to love the Lord your God, to
walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, His laws, and His
rules, that you may thrive and increase, and that the Lord your God may
bless you in the land that you are about to enter and
possess.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Listen to the cadences of this kind of language in Deuteronomy. We
haven't heard language like this before but it's what people often
think of when they think of biblical language. It starts here in
Deuteronomy.</p>

<blockquote>But if your heart turns away and you give no heed, and are
lured into the worship and service of other gods, I declare to you this
day that you shall certainly perish; you shall not long endure on the
soil that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. I call
heaven and earth to witness against you this day: I have put before you
life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life--if you and your
offspring would live--by loving the Lord your God, heeding His
commands, and holding fast to Him. For thereby you shall have life and
shall long endure upon the soil that the Lord your God swore to your
ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So all has been given. It's simply Israel's choice to take it or
not. The last section of the book, chapters 31 to 34, is a sort of
miscellany of appendices. There's some ancient poetry that's found in
chapter 32, which is referred to as The Song of Moses; scholars refer
to it as The Song of Moses. We have the blessings of Moses recorded in
chapter 33, and then chapter 34 is the story of Moses' death: I read
part of that to you.</p>

<p>Now centuries ago already scholars of the Bible noted that
Deuteronomy opens with the verse, "These are the words that Moses
addressed to all Israel on the other side of the Jordan," that is to
say the trans-Jordan, on the other side of the Jordan. So that line is
obviously written from the prospective of someone who is inside the
land, saying Moses said that when he was over there, outside the land,
on the other side of the Jordan--so he's looking eastward. And so
that's a line that one would think could not be written by Moses
because Moses did not ever enter the land and would not be in a
position to talk about something being on the other side of the Jordan.
Likewise the last chapter which describes Moses' death and burial
probably was not written by him. So as we shall see, these and many
other textual features point to the period of composition for
Deuteronomy, which was many centuries after the time that Moses would
have been supposed to have lived, if we are to assume he was a
historical character.</p>

<p>And so through careful analysis you have scholars like Moshe
Weinfeld and many others--I think Bernard Levinson is the one has
written about Deuteronomy in your <i>Jewish Study Bible</i>, and that's
a wonderful introduction to read there, so I encourage you to please
make sure you look at that--but analyses of scholars like these have
led them to draw the conclusion that the original core of Deuteronomy
emerged in the eighth century, and this is now where my interesting
little mountain-shaped diagram is going to come into play. It was
probably a scroll of laws known as the Book or the Scroll of the Torah.
Deuteronomy refers to itself that way in Deuteronomy 17:19-20. And so
we think it was probably something roughly equivalent to chapters 12 to
26; maybe there was a little introduction, a little conclusion. And
eventually these laws were put into the framework of a speech by Moses:
maybe chapters 5 through 11 and maybe 28; maybe that would've been in
the eighth, seventh century. And then at some later point several
things happened, and I will say them in the following order, but that
doesn't mean they happened in this order, we really aren't sure.</p>

<p>At some point several things happened. You have framing chapters,
Deuteronomy 1 through 4, the sort of introductory frame and historical
review, as well as the appendices at the end, chapters 31 and 34--those
get added. You also have laws being updated, passages being expanded,
to reflect the experience of exile. You'll remember that as of 586,
Jerusalem is destroyed and the Israelites are in exile in Babylonia.
Additionally at some point Deuteronomy is appended to the other four
books of the Pentateuch. Genesis through Numbers is made to precede
this. It's serving therefore as their conclusion, and by being joined
to them it confers its title as a book of Torah, as a scroll of Torah,
to that material as well. They don't use the word "Torah" in that way,
in those books; only Deuteronomy uses the word Torah to speak of God's
instruction or revelation overall. So by being appended now to Genesis
through Numbers, all of this perhaps comes to be known as Torah, as
well. And then finally during the exile or sorry, probably during the
period after the exile--no, during the exile, down to the end of the
sixth century, Deuteronomy was incorporated into a larger narrative
history that runs from Joshua through Judges, First and Second Samuel,
First and Second Kings: that's all a unit, as we'll come to see in the
next lecture. And so Deuteronomy in a way served as an introduction to
that material looking forward; so a conclusion to the previous four
books but also an introduction to a long narrative history that's going
to run through to the end of 2 Kings. Now there's a lot of debate over
the precise timing of these events and this process by which this
material grew and was expanded, but in the post-exilic period, at some
point, the entire unit, the Genesis through Numbers material,
Deuteronomy, and then the lengthy historical narrative, all the way
through 2 Kings, was solidified.</p>

<p>The Deuteronomistic history [correction: the Deuteronomic history,
i.e., the book of Deuteronomy] is sort of an odd conclusion to the
Genesis through Numbers material because it doesn't really have the
expected narrative climax. You sort of expect the story to end with the
entry of the Israelites into the land, and hopefully under Moses, and
that doesn't occur. Some scholars have suggested that deferring
Israel's possession of the land to the future may have reflected the
historical experience of exile, an experience which challenged the very
idea of the possession of the land as central to the maintenance of the
covenant. So if you are in exile, then perhaps a more satisfying ending
is to have Israel not in fact entering the land.</p>

<p>The complex process by which Deuteronomy was formed underscores the
fact that modern notions of authorship cannot be applied to biblical
texts. We think of an author, we tend to think of an author, as a
discrete individual who composes a text at a specific time, but this
isn't the way that texts came into being in the ancient world,
particularly important communal texts. As Weinfeld points out, the
biblical authors were what we would call collectors, compilers,
revisers, editors, and interpreters of ancient tradition. Ancient texts
were generally the product of many hands over the stretch of many long
centuries, and during that time modifications and recontextualizations
occurred. And so we refer to those who transmit and develop a text in
this way as a school; but you need to understand that we are using that
in a relatively informal way. So when we talk about the Deuteronomic
School or the Deuteronomistic School, we're really talking about the
fact that we have a set of texts that all seem to share a certain sort
of ideology or orientation; and yet we know that parts of them seem to
date from very, very different times. And so we think of that text as
being preserved, transmitted and developed by many hands who share
certain commonalities, common ideologies, we call it a school. It's not
that we know of the existence of a Deuteronomistic school, and we say,
oh, well then they must have produced this text. It's the other way
around. We have a text, and its features suggest to us a longstanding
tradition of scholarship, that preserved and transmitted the text in
that way. Same with the Priestly school: we're speaking about the
Priestly materials which clearly have evidence of originating from the
eighth, seventh, sixth and fifth centuries, and so there must have been
a common stretch of scholarship that would have preserved and
transmitted and developed those traditions, and we call that the
Priestly school.</p>

<p>The legal core of Deuteronomy--so really from 5 to 26, because 5 is
where some of the legal material begins--contains first of all a
somewhat expanded version of the Ten Commandments, you have that in
Deuteronomy 5, and then other laws, really from 12 to 26, that resemble
the legal material that's found in Exodus--the collection of material
we've called the Covenant Code. And they also seem to bear some
relationship to the laws in Leviticus and Numbers. But the question is,
what is the relationship between the different versions of the legal
material? Some of these laws will parallel each other quite closely and
others do not. So are Deuteronomy's legal traditions a direct response
to or modification of the laws in Exodus and Numbers, or are they best
understood as just different, independent formulations of a common
legal tradition?</p>

<p>Weinfeld has argued that Deuteronomy is dependent on the previous
traditions of the Pentateuch, that Deuteronomy revises and reforms them
according to new ideas: its new notion of a centralized cultic worship,
and secondly its humanitarian spirit. Those are two controlling
ideologies he says that shape its revision of pre-existing material. He
specifically argues that Deuteronomy is dependent on the E source, the
source that some scholars think is pretty hard to isolate or find in
the biblical text. But in E, Sinai is referred to as Horeb, and in
Deuteronomy Sinai is also Horeb. The author of Deuteronomy limits the
revelation at Sinai to the Decalogue and seems to assert that the full
law was given to Moses for the Israelites on the plains of Moab. In
Weinfeld's view this means that Deuteronomy, with its revisions, would
have been seen, would have been presented as and would have been seen
as an updated replacement of the old Book of the Covenant, rather than
its complement. It exists side by side in our text now, but I think in
his view those who promulgated it were understanding it as the updated
replacement of the laws of the Book of the Covenant.</p>

<p>For the most part Deuteronomy doesn't really contain much in the way
of civil law. It tends to focus on the moral-religious
prescriptions--kind of the apodictic law in Israel--and the few civil
laws that are there tend to be reworked in line with Deuteronomy's
humanity. So, for example, the laws of the tithe, the laws of the
seventh year release of debts, the rules for the release of slaves, the
rules for the three festivals--these are all ancient laws; they occur
in Exodus but they appear in Deuteronomy with modifications,
modifications about things that concern the Deuteronomists, and some of
you have discussed some of these in section. So in Deuteronomy the
Israelite debt slave comes out of his or her servitude, with generous
gifts from the owners. This is not something that appears in Exodus. Or
as another example, Deuteronomy extends the Covenant Code's prohibition
against afflicting a resident alien. In Deuteronomy there's the
insistence that the Israelites must not just refrain from afflicting
them, but must love the resident alien. It goes so far as to provide
concrete legal benefits, food and so on, for the resident alien.</p>

<p>So while the relationship of D to some of the laws in the Covenant
Code is often--not always but often--one of revision, the relationship
between D and the laws in the Priestly source is more difficult to
characterize. The Priestly source seems to represent an equally early
set of laws, legal traditions, that just emanated from a very different
circle and had different concerns. It tends to deal with sacral topics,
or if it's dealing with other topics it will deal with the sacral
implications of those topics. Like D, P often updates and revises laws
of the Covenant Code. We can see that in the fact that the Priestly
source abolishes Israelite debt slavery altogether and insists that
slaves must be acquired only from the nations around Israel: no
Israelite can enslave another Israelite. Nevertheless Weinfeld argues
that on occasion Deuteronomy contains laws that are also found in P,
but presents them in a more rational manner, is the word he uses, or
desacralized manner. So D's treatment, Deuteronomy's treatment of
sacrifice, we'll see in a moment, is going to be different, for
example, from P's. They have different concerns and different foci in
their presentation of that material.</p>

<p>In any event, many scholars through their analysis of these texts
have been led to conclude that the Deuteronomistic School updated and
revised earlier laws, particularly laws in the Covenant Code, but
sometimes also in the older legal stratum of P; and they did so in
keeping with the circumstances of the eighth to sixth century. So
Deuteronomy exemplifies a phenomenon that occurs at several critical
junctures in Israel's history--and we're going to see this as we move
forward through the biblical text--and that is the modification and
re-writing of earlier laws and traditions in the light of new
circumstances and ideas. So Deuteronomy is itself an implicit
authorization of the process of interpretation. And the notion of
canon, or sacred canon, that's exemplified then by biblical texts is
one that allows for continued unfolding and development of the sacred
tradition. And that's an idea that I think differs very much from
modern intuitions about the nature of sacred canons. I think a lot of
people have the intuition that a sacred canon means that the text is
fixed, static and authoritative because it is fixed and static, or
unchanging. That's not the biblical view or ancient view of sacred
canon. Texts representing sacred revelation were modified, they were
revised, they were rephrased, they were updated and they were
interpreted in the process of transmission and preservation. It was
precisely because a text or a tradition was sacred and authoritative
that it was important that it adapt and speak to new circumstances;
otherwise it would appear to be irrelevant. So it's a very different
notion of what it means for something to be canonical and sacred, from
what I think some moderns have come to understand those terms to
mean.</p>

<p>So what are the special circumstances and concerns that guide
Deuteronomy's revisions of tradition? One of the primary changes--you
probably heard in section as well by now--is the emphasis on worship at
a single, central shrine. That's going to represent a great change in
Israel's religious practice. According to Deuteronomy the central
sanctuary will be located in a place that God himself will choose--it's
not named in Deuteronomy--or in a place where he will cause his name to
dwell; that's the other phrase that's used. Jerusalem is never
explicitly mentioned as the site in question but Jerusalem will later,
in fact, fulfill this function, according to other biblical texts.</p>

<p>Now there are striking similarities between Deuteronomy's religious
program and the major religious reforms that were carried out in the
eighth century by King Hezekiah, but even more so in the seventh
century by King Josiah, around 622: King Josiah. This is a reform
that's reported in the book of 2 Kings, in 2 Kings 22. This reform has
long been noticed and provides scholars with a basis for dating the
core materials of Deuteronomy, dating them to the late seventh century.
According to the story in 2 Kings, during temple repairs that were
being done in the time of King Josiah, the scroll of the Torah--that's
how it's phrased--the scroll of the Torah was found and when it was
read the king was distressed because its requirements were not being
upheld. Now this term, the scroll of the Torah, as I said, does not
occur in Genesis through Numbers; it is a phrase that occurs in
Deuteronomy, in Deuteronomy 17. Then continuing the account in 2 Kings,
Josiah is said to take action. He assembles the people, he publicly
reads the scroll, the people agree to its terms and then Josiah's
reforms begin. We hear that he purges the temple of vessels that had
been made for Baal and Asherah, that were in the Temple of Yahweh. He
removes all foreign elements from the cult, he prohibits sacrifice to
Yahweh anywhere but in the central sanctuary. He destroys all of the
high places--this refers to sort of rural shrines that were scattered
throughout the countryside where local priests and Levites might offer
sacrifices for people--ritual shrines and pillars being used in the
worship of Yahweh: these are deemed to be quite legitimate in the J and
E sources. The patriarchs are doing this sort of thing all the time,
building altars all around the country, but it's Deuteronomy that
contains commandments to destroy the worship, first of all the worship
of other gods but also the worship of Yahweh in high places or in rural
shrines. So this is evidence again that what Josiah found to base his
reforms on was something like the Book of Deuteronomy: it's Deuteronomy
that contains the prohibitions of high places and so on.</p>

<p>After these reforms it's reported that the Passover was celebrated.
It was celebrated not as a family observance in individual homes; it
was celebrated as a national pilgrimage festival, celebrated by
everyone in Jerusalem. That's how its celebration is described in the
Book of Deuteronomy. It's described as a family celebration in
individual homes in the other books of the Bible. So again this is
another basis for the conclusion that the scroll of the law, found by
Josiah and guiding his reforms, was something like the legal core of
Deuteronomy. Scholars now think that that legal core of Deuteronomy was
produced in the Northern Kingdom, the Northern Kingdom of Israel which
fell in 722, you'll recall. It was probably produced there in the
eighth century, and that is supported by the fact that Deuteronomy has
affinities with the writings of some prophets we'll be looking at later
from the Northern Kingdom of the eighth century, such as the prophet
Hosea, and we'll see this when we look at Hosea's writings. It also has
affinities with the E source, which is also connected with the Northern
Kingdom. In the ninth and eighth century, the Northern Kingdom was the
site of a struggle, a struggle against Baal worship. It was also home
to certain prophets such as Elijah and Elisha, who are known for their
zealotry and their exclusive Yahwism.</p>

<p>So some scholars think that was going on in the ninth/eighth century
in the north, the sort of Yahweh-only party that was working hard and
struggling against Baal worship. And they think that those Yahweh-only
traditions were brought south; after the fall of the Northern Kingdom
in 722, you have refugees coming south, they brought these traditions
with them. Some of these written materials were put into the Temple and
then about a century later, during Josiah's time, when the Temple was
being refurbished, they were found. Possibly this material was then
worked into a larger scroll, given its Mosaic introductions and so on,
and that all contributed to Josiah's reform.</p>

<p>So the centralization of the cult also needs to be understood
against the larger political backdrop of the late seventh century. The
Assyrian threat loomed large. You have to remember that the Northern
Kingdom has already been completely destroyed: ten tribes exiled,
deported, and essentially lost. The Southern Kingdom managed to escape
destruction but only by paying tribute as a vassal to Assyria. So
Judah, the Southern Kingdom, is a tribute-paying vassal state to the
Assyrian overlord. And of course there's a great deal of Assyrian
cultural influence and religious influence in Judah as a result. So 2
Kings tells us that there were foreign forms of worship being
introduced right into the Temple. Josiah's reforms have been
interpreted by some as an attempt to assert the political and the
cultural and religious autonomy of Judah. Unregulated worship
throughout the land was no longer going to be acceptable; the people
were going to be united around a central, standardized Yahweh cult,
which would be purged of any Assyrian influence or foreign influence.
And this was deemed as necessary to stand up against or to survive the
Assyrian threat. So it's in that context that we can look at the very
strong parallels that exist between the Book of Deuteronomy and certain
Assyrian treaties, from the seventh century.</p>

<p>We already talked about the Hittite vassal treaties as a model for
the Israelite covenant, when we were talking about Exodus. But
Deuteronomy is clearly dependent on another model and that is the
Assyrian vassal treaty. The best exemplars of these treaties are the
treaties of the Assyrian emperor Esarhaddon. He was a seventh century
ruler of Assyria, down to about 669. These treaties were discovered
about 50 years ago, and Moshe Weinfeld is one of the people who's done
a tremendous amount of work with these treaties. He's argued at great
length that Deuteronomy reworks the second-millennium Hittite model in
accordance with the covenantal patterns that are evident in the
first-millennium vassal treaties of Esarhaddon. We see history being
used as a motivational tool and we see laws being reinforced by curses;
and it's fascinating, if you line up some of the curses in Esarhaddon's
treaties with the curses in Deuteronomy, there's an amazing
correspondence. Deuteronomy also includes blessings; the Assyrians
didn't do that. Weinfeld notes that the Assyrian treaties are really
loyalty oaths that are imposed upon vassals, rather than true
covenants. And Deuteronomy is also something of a loyalty oath, except
that the people are pledging their loyalty to a god rather than to a
human king. So you have the exhortation to love the Lord your God--and
think back to some of that language that we heard as I read Deuteronomy
30 -- he exhortation to love the Lord your God, to go after God, to
fear God, to listen to the voice of God: these are all typical of
pledges of loyalty, and they are paralleled in the Assyrian treaties
where the vassal has to love the crown prince, he has to listen to the
voice of the crown prince. The same phraseologies are used. So it is a
political literary form, but it's borrowed and it's referred to God.
The Assyrian treaties also will warn against prophets or ecstatics or
dream interpreters who will try to foment sedition. If you'll notice in
Deuteronomy 13 we have something quite similar: a warning against false
prophets who will try to foment sedition, and lead the people to the
worship of other gods. Some scholars refer to Deuteronomy as a kind of
counter treaty, if you will, right? A subversive document that's trying
to shift the people's loyalty from the Assyrian overlord to God, the
true sovereign, and it's part of a national movement.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy differs in style, in terminology, in outlook and in
theological assumptions from the other books of the Torah. As a series
of public speeches it adopts a highly rhetorical tone, a very...
sometimes an almost artificial style. It's a style of a very skilled
preacher almost. It employs direct address: you, you; sometimes in the
singular, sometimes in the plural, but Moses is constantly speaking in
a very personal tone, direct address. And there are all sorts of
hortatory phrases, phrases that exhort you: to do this with all your
heart and soul, do this in order that it may go well with you. The land
is described as a land where milk and honey flow, and if only you will
obey the voice of Yahweh your God. This is the kind of language that's
used here, and not so much in the other books.</p>

<p>So let's isolate now some of the major themes of Deuteronomy, before
we close our study of the Pentateuch. First of all as I've mentioned,
the centralization of the cult: that's a key theme in the book of
Deuteronomy and it had very important effects. It brought Judean
religion closer to monotheism because you have the insistence of
worshiping one god in his one central sanctuary. Sacrifice was offered
only on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, which meant that slaughter of animals
for meat in the countryside no longer has a sacral component to it.
It's just ordinary, common, profane slaughter. There's evidence that
that wasn't true before this reform, that if you wanted to kill an
animal for meat you had a kind of a makeshift altar out there in the
field, and you would pour out the blood and give it back to God and so
on. You might still pour out the blood, obviously, but there was
previously a more sacral element to it. Now slaughter in the
countryside was simply common, profane slaughter. As a result you have
a lot of rural Levites who are out of business now, a lot of people who
would have officiated at local shrines, and they're out of business:
that probably explains the fact that Deuteronomy makes special
provision for the Levites and includes them in its... in legislation,
sort of social welfare legislation. There are provisions that are made
for the Levites, who are not going to be able to earn their income
anymore at these local shrines. So many of them would have gone up to
Jerusalem and a real tension is going to develop between the Jerusalem
priests and this class of Levites who are newcomers; and we'll see some
of that tension played out in some other texts.</p>

<p>So [there's] centralization of the cult and that has some social
ramifications. We also have a greater abstraction of the deity; this is
something many people point to in the Book of Deuteronomy because
Deuteronomy and books that are related to it--those that are going to
follow--consistently refer to the sanctuary as the place where Yahweh
chose to cause his name to dwell. God himself isn't said to dwell in
the temple, nor is the temple described as a house of God. The temple
is always the dwelling of his name. The house is built for his name.
Weinfeld asserts that this is in order to combat the ancient popular
belief that God actually dwells in the sanctuary. Likewise to eradicate
or guard against the idea, which is implicit in earlier sources, that
God sits enthroned on the cherubim, on the cherubim, who guard his ark,
Deuteronomy emphasizes that the function of the ark is exclusively to
house the tablets, the tablets of the covenant; that's its purpose. The
ark cover isn't mentioned, the cherubim aren't mentioned. We don't have
the image of this as a throne with the ark as God's footstool. So it
seems to be a greater abstraction of the deity.</p>

<p>Some abstraction is also apparent in the shift from visual to aural
imagery in describing God's self-manifestations or theophanies. One
hears God but one doesn't see God, in Deuteronomy. And that's very
different from earlier texts where we're seeing a sort of a cloud
encased fire and so on. So the sanctuary is understood to be a house of
worship, as much as it is a cultic center, in which Israelites and
foreigners alike may deliver prayers to God who dwells in heaven. So he
is in heaven; this is a place of worship. That's not to say that
sacrifice is abolished, it's not to say that sacrifice isn't important
to Deuteronomy--very far from it, it's an essential part of God's
service for Deuteronomy. But Deuteronomy is less interested in cultic
matters and in any event when it focuses on sacrifices it focuses on a
different aspect of those sacrifices. The sacrifices it talks about
consist primarily of offerings that are consumed by the offerer in the
sanctuary, or are shared with the disenfranchised in some way: the
Levite, the resident alien [correction: resident alien], the orphan,
the widow--portions are given to them. So by emphasizing the obligation
to share the sacrificial meal with disadvantaged members of society,
Deuteronomy almost gives the impression that the primary purpose of the
sacrifice is humanitarian, or at least personal--the fulfillment of a
religious obligation or the expression of gratitude to God and so on.
These are aspects of the sacrifices that are emphasized in
Deuteronomy.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy also emphasizes social justice and personal ethics and
neighborly responsibility. God's own righteous behavior on behalf of
the weak and the oppressed is a model for Israel's righteous behavior.
God assists the orphan, the widow and the stranger, and that's the
basis of Israel's injunction to assist them also. It's the basis for
the humanitarianism that I mentioned earlier that seems to run through
the laws of Deuteronomy 12 through 26.</p>

<p>A further theme in Deuteronomy is the fact that the covenant concept
entails the idea that each generation of Israelites understand itself
as having been bound with God in the original covenant. So in
Deuteronomy 5:2-3: "The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb
[Sinai]. It was not with our fathers that the Lord made this covenant
but with us, the living, every one of us who is here today." Now this
is interesting because remember the generation has died off, that saw
the Exodus and Sinai, right? So these are the children now and they're
saying, it was us, every one of us who is here today. So every
generation of Israel is to view itself as standing at the sacred
mountain to conclude a covenant with God, and that decisive moment has
to be made ever-present. That's a process that's facilitated by the
obligation to study, to study the laws, to recite them daily, to teach
them to your children: these are instructions that are contained in
Deuteronomy.</p>

<p>Moreover Deuteronomy 31 proclaims that every seventh year the Torah
is to be read publicly, the entire thing. And Weinfeld argues that
where many Ancient Near Eastern cultures direct the king to write the
laws for himself, to read them, it's only in Israel--he's yet to find a
parallel--it's only in Israel that the law is a manual for both the
king and the people. It's to be proclaimed and read aloud to the
people, on a regular basis, every seven years.</p>

<p>A further theme of Deuteronomy is the emphasis on love. Weinfeld
points out that the Assyrian treaties stress the vassal's love for the
crown prince, but there's never a reciprocal love by the crown prince
for the vassal. And Deuteronomy differs in this respect. Deuteronomy
emphasizes God's gracious and undeserved love of Israel, and that's
expressed in his mighty acts on Israel's behalf. The Deuteronomist
makes it clear that God's great love should awaken a reciprocal love on
Israel's part, love of God. Love of God here really means loyalty. The
word that is used is a word that stresses loyalty. Love and loyalty are
mere abstractions, however, without some sort of vehicle for their
expression; and the vehicle for their expression then is God's Torah,
the sum total of God's teachings and instructions and laws and
guidelines, which are supposed to ensure long life and prosperity in
the land.</p>

<p>That idea is found in a very important passage known as the
<i>Shema</i>. This is a passage that's really a central expression of
the love of God in Israel, and it's been singled out as an essential
part of the Jewish liturgy, at a very early, early stage, and continues
to this day. It's so called because of the first word of the passage.
It's in Deuteronomy 6, it begins in verse 4, and the first word is
"hear," <i>Shema</i>.</p>

<blockquote>Hear, O Israel! Yahweh is our God, Yahweh alone. You shall
love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and
with all your might. Take to heart these instructions with which I
charge you this day. Impress them upon your children. Recite them when
you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you
get up. Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them serve as a symbol
on your forehead; inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and on
your gates.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So love and loyalty to God is the foundation of the Torah but Torah
is the fulfillment of this love and loyalty: studying it and observing
it and teaching it and transmitting it.</p>

<p>Another key idea that occurs in Deuteronomy is the idea of Israel as
the chosen people. We find it here for the first time. It's an
expression of the particularity of Israel and its unique relationship
with God, and that uniqueness is expressed by this term, <i>bachar</i>,
which means "to elect" or "to choose." This is the first time we
encounter this. Yahweh has chosen Israel in an act of freely bestowed
grace and love to be his special property. Deuteronomy 10:14:</p>

<blockquote>Mark, the heavens to their uttermost reaches belong to the
Lord your God, the earth and all that is on it! Yet it was to your
fathers that the Lord was drawn in His love for them, so that He chose
you, their lineal descendents, from among all peoples--as is now the
case.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>This idea may be rooted in the Ancient Near Eastern political sphere
in which sovereigns would single out vassals for the status of special
property; and in fact the word used [for this special property] is a
word we do find in Exodus.</p>

<p>But Deuteronomy contains statements of national pride, national
exaltation, and unlike the Priestly materials which portray holiness as
a future goal to be attained through the observance of God's Torah--you
shall be holy to me by doing the following things--Deuteronomy speaks
of Israel as holy now, and thus bound to the observance of God's Torah
because of their holiness: you are a holy people to me, therefore you
should do... So to put it--and this is perhaps to put it too
crudely--for P, for the Priestly source, holiness is a goal to be
attained through obedience to God's Torah. For Deuteronomy, holiness is
a status to be lost through disobedience to God's Torah.</p>

<p>When we come back I just want to finish up with one or two last
comments about a couple of key ideas or themes in Deuteronomy before we
move on to the beginning of the Deuteronomistic history that starts in
Joshua. This coming week you'll be having midterms as part of your
section meeting and in addition at 6 p.m. tonight I'll be making the
essay question available online and if it gets to 6:01 and there's
nothing online, somebody call me real fast, okay? All right, good,
thanks, and good luck with the exam.</p>
