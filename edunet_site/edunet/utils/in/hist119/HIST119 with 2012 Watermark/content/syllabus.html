<h2>HIST 119: <strong>The Civil War and Reconstruction Era, 1845-1877</strong> (Spring, 2008)</h2>

<h3>Syllabus</h3>
<h4>Professor:</h4>

<p class="lastParagraph">David W. Blight, Class of 1954 Professor of American History, Yale University</p>

<h4>Description:</h4>

<p class="lastParagraph">This course will explore the causes, course, and consequences of the American Civil War, from the 1840s to 1877. The primary goal of the course is to understand the multiple meanings of a transforming event in American history.  Those meanings may be defined in many ways: national, sectional, racial, constitutional, individual, social, intellectual, or moral.  We will especially examine four broad themes: the crisis of union and disunion in an expanding republic; slavery, race, and emancipation as national problem, personal experience, and social process; the experience of modern, total war for individuals and society; and the political and social challenges of Reconstruction. The course attempts, in several ways, to understand the interrelationships between regional, national, and African-American history.  And finally, we hope to probe the depths of why the Civil War era has a unique hold on the American historical imagination.</p>
