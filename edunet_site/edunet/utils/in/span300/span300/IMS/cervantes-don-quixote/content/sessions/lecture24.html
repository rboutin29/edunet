<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>Would have Cervantes deserved such recognition, had he not written the <em>Quixote</em>? The answer is no. However, he would probably be remembered for some of his other works. Two of <em>The Exemplary Stories</em>, significantly connected together, are commented in this lecture. "The Deceitful Marriage" deconstructs marriage both as a social institution and as a narrative tool: Cervantes manipulates literary conventions by beginning with what is normally the end of a story, a marriage, and works backwards to undue a union that never took place legitimately. In "The Dogs Colloquy" we skirt the supernatural idea that dogs can talk. The story is a picaresque autobiography in which the <em>pícaro</em> pretends to be a dog. Perhaps Scipio's life, not told here, could have been another Quixote. The author of a story, it is suggested, does not control the text while it is being read. A short comment on Kafka's parable "The Truth about Sancho Panza" and Borges' story <em>Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote</em> precede the end of this last lecture that refers to Cervantes' death. Drawing a parallel between Cervantes' death and that of Don Quixote and Alonso Quijano, González Echevarría reads the dedication to <em>Persiles</em> and Cervantes', and also his own, farewell to this course.</p>
