<p><b>Professor John Wargo</b>: Today, we're going
to embark on a discussion about air quality law. And I'm going to start with
really an assertion by the Environmental Protection Agency that I've come to
think of as a myth of sorts, when they have claimed that the nation's air
quality has improved dramatically in the past twenty-five years. </p>
<p>Well, how would you
know if that's true? How would you contest that? What kind of evidence would
you want? And what we'll find today is that your answer to this really depends
upon what pollutants you choose to measure, what you know about the toxicity of
different pollutants, where you measure the pollutants, do you measure them in
a fixed monitor out in the field someplace in the middle of northeastern
Connecticut? Or do you do it next to a highway in New Haven or Bridgeport? </p>
<p>And how you spend
your time. Where do you spend the majority of your time? I bet it's not where
EPA measures pollutants. The majority of your time is spent indoors, I would
guess, overwhelmingly indoors. And how do you behave indoors? And by that I
mean, how would your behavior affect your exposure to pollutants indoors? These
are all questions that became apparent late in the twentieth century, are
really important to know whether or not law works. </p>
<p>And this law, the
Clean Air Act, the pesticide law, it has a very technical character to it, and
I think that you can understand by now in the course that environmental law is
not just about making rules. It's about understanding the environment and how
it works and how it responds to different kinds of human stresses. And also,
it's about what we can do to relieve those stresses. So there's a technical
side to this that there is not in many other forms of law. </p>
<p>So is the air quality
improving, and if not, why? So think about the different kinds of legal
strategies and standards that have been designed to control air quality in
history? Well one is land use and zoning. So thinking about how you'd segregate
different land uses. So you keep the industrial facilities or say the military
sites away from the residential areas. So this idea of segregation or buffering
land uses where you know you have high levels of emissions from those where people
reside away from schools. This was one of the earliest forms of attempted
control. And there are examples in London back in the seventeenth century of
prohibiting certain kinds of facilities, rendering plants or plants that
produce a lot of smoke in the air from being in residential areas. </p>
<p>Another approach to
controlling air quality is the idea if setting a ceiling or an allowable
emission limit. So the idea that you would chemical by chemical set an
allowable level of contamination in the air has become really central to the
way that we've thought about trying to manage our health. So have these
policies been developed in a way that's precautionary, to prevent significant
deterioration? And as you look at the structure of the Clean Air Act, you'll
see that the idea, prevention of significant deterioration, is a really
critical concept. So we don&#39;t -- as a nation we've decided we don't really want
to make the air quality worse that it is. That we're on a path toward
restoration or improvement in quality. </p>
<p>We've also found that
it's important to think differently about mobile sources than it is about
stationary sources. And quite frankly, if you were the administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency back in 1970 and you walked into this problem
of having a zillion stacks in the county that were emitting dangerous
chemicals, you would concentrate on very visible sources. So it's a very
different kind of a problem, and one where we've made more progress because we
could identify the stack and we could put monitors on those stacks, than we
face in indoor environments, when we don't really have any understanding of the
kinds of chemicals that we're exposed to. </p>
<p>Trans-boundary flows
of pollution have been traditionally very difficult to control. The Canadians
are pretty upset with us in the way that we transfer much of the air pollution
that is produced in the Midwestern United States up across central and
northeastern Canada. As is New York upset with Ohio and the power plants in
Ohio that are burning more coal and the pollutants from Ohio are moving into
New York. So how do we control trans-boundary movements across state boundaries
or across even local boundaries, or the most difficult situation would be
national boundaries. </p>
<p>Property rights to
pollute. This is an interesting idea. And really, this idea that you could set
an allowable ceiling and instead of telling every person that lives in that
region that they have to comply with a certain level of emission, that you put
a cap on the total emission for that region, and then gradually you lower that
cap down. So this is the idea of cap and trade. And it really grew out of an
attempt to control acid precipitation associated with sulfur dioxides and
nitrogen oxides that caused a whole array of problems, including loss of
certain species. </p>
<p>So in the
Adirondacks, I take a seminar to the Adirondacks in the fall every year. All
the lakes above 2,500 feet in elevation don't have trout in the Adirondacks
because of the way that SO<sub>2</sub> and NOx create acid aerosols that rain
down and make those lakes too acidic for those fish to grow. Buildings around
the world have been deteriorated, especially if they're made out of limestone
because of acid aerosols. The red spruce at high elevations in the Northeastern
U.S., up on Mt. Washington or up in the Adirondacks or the Green Mountains,
those red spruce are in decline. And the decline is caused by the fact that
clouds hang over the tops of these mountain peaks and the fog itself is acid,
so that it's causing vulnerability to different illness. So capping and trading
is now believed to be the more efficient way to reduce pollution. The idea
began initially with Environmental Defense, when it was called Environmental
Defense Fund, but it now has become really the cornerstone of attempts to
control the CO<sub>2</sub> problem that we face. </p>
<p>Technology forcing
standards: so what if your technology is not capable of reducing emission to
the level that you want it to be? Well, you can set an aspirational standard.
By that I mean that you give an industry or a sector a certain period of time
within which they would have to reduce their emissions. By the way, it's only
fitting that I can smell diesel exhaust in here today. I don't know if anybody
else can smell it. But it must be from the construction equipment. It's a
fitting topic for the air quality in the room. I should have my little monitor
here. So the idea that you would create these aspirational standards was
embedded into the Clean Air Act. </p>
<p>Fuel content
regulations, I think it's an interesting issue that we've been more concerned
about what comes out of the stacks and what comes out of the tailpipes than we
have about controlling the fuel and the process of its burning in order to
reduce those emissions. So the idea of filtering what is coming out at the end
of the process, the combustion process, as opposed to thinking more carefully
about the nature of the fuel. We made serious mistakes in history, thinking
about leaded fuel as an example. So lead was added to fuel to make engines more
efficient and to knock less and to make them less prone to breakdown. But it
spewed lead around the world. And recognizing that lead got into the bones of
children and induced developmental and neurological disorders, that's a very
important story. </p>
<p>So fuel content
regulation, in a way, there's an interesting similarity to the way that we feed
animals. So kind of neglecting residues that are in animal feed or neglecting
the strontium-90 that was in the feed that went into cattle and then made its
way to our dinner plates. It's similar to neglecting the content of fuel and
just not caring about where it's going to go. So thinking about residues out
there in the ambient environment as the target for regulation, as opposed to
the underlying source, either the technology of the engine or the type of fuel
that is burned. </p>
<p>So indoor behavioral
regulation, we'll see that after the break when we come back and look at
tobacco regulation. So thinking about what is the right of the government to
regulate what we do indoors in our houses as opposed to outdoors. And the idea
of building certification standards and development certification standards.
More commonly today than ever before, we're seeing a variety of different land
use regulations structured in a way that are designed to reduce energy
consumption or to guide it in a way that produces less air pollutions. So
here's a suite of strategies that might be used to control air quality in a
variety of different situations. </p>
<p>So just a couple of
quick slides on key points relative to the structure of the Clean Air Act. We
have Air Quality Control Regions. So each state has to set up a designated area
as either in attainment or at non-attainment. And if you're in attainment, you
meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, NAAQS. And states have to put
together state implementation plans. The idea being that states would have a
better capacity to know the behavior of sources of emissions, and it would have
a better ability to monitor what's going on and to enforce violations of the
statute. </p>
<p>So the state
implementation plans have to have established enforceable limits, methods for
acquiring air quality data, meaning that they've got to set up a surveillance
system. Also, boundaries have to be well identifiable. They have to set up an
enforcement program, and also have to demonstrate how they are controlling
release of pollutants that could cross state boundaries. And also, they have to
set up reporting requirements back to the Environmental Protection Agency. </p>
<p>So what happens if a
state implementation plan fails? I asked the question of the head of the air
quality division at the Department of Environmental Protection who was
responsible for Connecticut's state implementation plan. And he said,
&quot;Well, we could have our highway funds revoked or we could have them
seriously diminished.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, how often does that
happen?&quot; Well, first I said, &quot;Well how often are you out of
compliance with the requirements, the limits for the national ambient standards
or the hazardous air pollutants?&quot; And he said, &quot;Oh, quite often. In
fact, southern Connecticut and especially in the New Haven region, is out of
compliance for ozone and particulate matter routinely.&quot; And I said,
&quot;Well, does that mean that the state has been forced to recommend to EPA
to restrict highway funds?&quot; And he looked at me and he said, &quot;Well
now, we never really would do that.&quot; And I said, &quot;Does that mean that
EPA has never restricted or reduced highway funds to the state?&quot; And the
answer was no. So you've got a monitoring burden, you've got an enforcement
burden that really is not working. </p>
<p>So you've got primary
and secondary standards, and the primary standards have to be set to protect
human health. And the secondary standards are set to protect environmental
quality and property. And you'll recall the effect of acid precipitation on
building stone as an example. </p>
<p>Criteria pollutants
are listed. So that this is a listing statute, just like the Safe Drinking
Water Act. The analogy there would be the maximum contaminant levels. But also
the Endangered Species Act. And because it is a statute where the chemical has
to be listed before it gets any attention or is limited, then it has the same
political dynamics as those other two statutes. Everybody fights about which
chemical is going to be placed on the list. </p>
<p>So there are also a
class of chemicals, about 190, that are called hazardous air pollutants. And
I'll go through these just quickly. The criteria pollutants that were initially
believed to be dangerous to health include particulates, SO<sub>2</sub>, NOx,
carbon monoxide, ozone, and lead. And by the way, all of these chemicals are
either emitted or they are created from automobile exhaust, just this one
example. </p>
<p>But then we have this
other category that's called hazardous air pollutants. Asbestos, mercury,
arsenic, beryllium, vinyl chloride, benzene, benzene is a known human
carcinogen, radionuclides, coke oven emissions, and coal tars. So that there is
this ambiguity in language that's embedded into the act. Clearly, the criteria pollutants
are dangerous, they're hazardous. And the government has paid a lot of
attention to these six compounds and not much attention to the hazardous air
pollutants that include volatile organic compounds, some of which are ozone
precursors. </p>
<p>So how are these
standards set? What do they look like? Well it gets a big technical, and I'm
not going to spend much time on it. But there's been an increasing sensitivity
about the danger of particulate matter if it is superfine. So originally, EPA
went after particulate matter ten, which is ten microns in diameter, in size,
and had neglected anything that was finer. So that eventually, standards were
set for PM 2.5. But take a look at the units here. The units here are kind of
fascinating. </p>
<p>So just take PM 2.5, because
we're going be talking about that with respect to diesel emissions. Ninety
percent of diesel emissions are actually PM 1 or less, so that they are really
quite fine. So it's set at fifteen micrograms per cubic meter, and it's hard to
wrap your head around what that means. Or sixty-five micrograms per cubic
meter, as a yearly average. And I'll come back to the averaging issue. And for
some of the pollutants there's an annual average, for some pollutants there's twenty-four
[hour] average. And this is extremely important. So there's a politic that
surrounds the averaging period that EPA has allowed. </p>
<p>And by the way, when
EPA wants to establish a new limit, how do they do it? Well, they publish a
notice in the federal register. How many of you have ever commented on a Clean
Air Act standards being proposed in the federal register? Really? You've done
that? </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Maybe if I had any
help from like Sierra Club or something, I'd do something like that.</p>
<p><b>Professor John Wargo</b>: Well that's great.
You're the first student in about ten years that's raised his hand. But very
few people pay attention to the federal register and very few people have the
capacity to comment in a technical way that would be potentially effective. </p>
<p>So here are the ozone
standards, the carbon monoxide standards and lead standards, and they all have
different averaging periods. Well, it's worth your reflection on how those
averaging periods are established. And I'm not going to go into that except
with respect to PM 2.5 today. </p>
<p>So the hazardous air
pollutant provisions were largely neglected by the EPA. And Congress got upset
in 1990 because only seven chemicals were regulated. By the way, there are six
national ambient standards set, you know, PM and CO and lead that I just showed
you. There were seven standards set for hazardous air pollutants as of 1990.
And Congress said, &quot;What? This doesn't make any sense.&quot; So how many
air pollutants are there, anyway? Well, just in wood smoke is one example, or
tobacco smoke, there are between 2,000 and 4,000 different particles, different
compounds. So particles of different size. So the attention of government on so
few compounds is really quite striking. </p>
<p>So Congress said,
&quot;What are you doing? What are you doing with the hazardous air
pollutants?&quot; And EPA said, &quot;Well, we've just been so overwhelmed
trying to figure how to manage emissions from stacks. And we've had a hard time
in just dealing with six of the ambient standards, so we haven't paid much
attention to it.&quot; So they established separate categories in the
amendments of 1990. This set of amendments was probably the most important set
of amendments in the history of the Clean Air Act. And it categorized minor and
major sources and put into place the maximum achievable control technology standard.
Maximum achievable control technology. </p>
<p>So it basically is
forward-looking, thinking about the potential of technology, and in some
instances, setting standards that are beyond what technology could meet. But
offsets were also allowed to reduce hazardous air pollutants within plants. And
what that means is that if you're a refinery, say there's a huge refinery with
about a hundred different stacks that exist between Los Angeles and San Diego
on the eastern side of the I-5 and it has so many stacks coming out of it that
those refineries and other industries, large chemical companies, went to EPA
and said, &quot;Well look, we don't want to have to meet these standards for
every stack. For the ones where I'm emitting lower levels than what would be
allowable, can I use that as an offset for the emissions for the stack that's
emitting more than is allowable?&quot; And this provision was enacted to allow
the companies to play a greater role in trying to figure out how they could
reduce their overall emissions. </p>
<p>Well, today for the
next twenty, twenty-five minutes, what I want to do is I want to focus on
vehicle emissions. Because it's extremely important to our energy future and
our climate future, but it's also extremely important to our health. It's
affecting us quite differentially based upon where we live, how we behave, and
also our ethnicity. And this is because different ethnic groups have different
background susceptibility. So all the principles that we talked about with
respect to pesticides and strontium-90 about gee, you know, not everybody's
exposed in the same way, or not everybody is equally vulnerable. Or some people
have background illnesses. </p>
<p>Well, this is a story
in part about the genetic susceptibility of certain populations that have a
higher prevalence of respiratory illness than others. For example, whites have
a lower prevalence of asthma in the United States than do African Americans.
And people of Puerto Rican descent have the highest in the nation. So that's
very difficult to explain. It's difficult to tease out whether or not there's a
relationship between the smaller ethnic groups and where they live inside urban
areas. There's a separate debate about whether or not there's a genetic
characteristic that makes them more susceptible. </p>
<p>So I want you to
think about the vehicle problem for a moment, which I think of as enormously
complicated and enormously important. So that the way that we've been managing
our consumption of fuel and vehicles and the way that we've used public
subsidies to allow us to move more freely round our landscape has had just an
enormous effect on our health, our behavior, as well as the quality of the
environment. Two hundred and thirty-five million vehicles in the U.S., about
320 million people in the U.S., so that there's now one vehicle in the country
for everybody that has a driver's license or is eligible for a driver's
license. So three trillion miles have been traveled in the past year. Two
hundred billion gallons of fuel, 600 billion dollars per year at three dollars
per gallon. And the average fuel efficiency of vehicles in the U.S. is about
seventeen miles per gallon. </p>
<p>Some of you are
helping me with a study of trucking and barging in an effort to try to think
about reducing diesel emissions from trucks, tractor trailer trucks coming up
ninety-five. Port Authority in New Jersey receives about five million of the
containers that come in on barges to the Port Authority, and make their way up
into Connecticut across the New York Border and move up toward Boston and deliver
goods in southern Connecticut and Providence, Rhode Island, and also in the
Boston area. So that one of the issues that we're looking at is could we do
something that would employ barges to move those containers so that it would
avoid the adverse effects associated with trucking moving through the region,
which is in part related to their climate influence, but also the really bad
air quality in Connecticut surrounds the I-95 corridor and the I-91 interchange
moving up toward Hartford. Those trucks, by the way, get about five to five and
a half miles per gallon. </p>
<p>How about the lag in
adoption of technology-forcing standards? So say that you were the EPA
administrator and you decided you wanted to do something about this
low-diameter particle and you published a regulation and went through the
comment period, by the way, that is governed by the Administrative Procedures
Act. And you mandated a reduction in say NOx and PM. In the case of particulate
matter and NOx, this standard was proposed to be adopted back in the late
1990s, 1998. And eventually, it was adopted following litigation and following
the <i>Whitman v. American Trucker</i> decision went into force. But it didn't
phase in to make any changes until 2006 and 2010 in requirements for engine
design. </p>
<p>So you need to think
about kind of the -- last night in section I said it's like the glacial pace of
regulation. So supposing the science is really clear and it tells you that the
current level of air quality or current emissions are really dangerous and that
there's a link between disease in the population and the emission levels, and
you want to do something about it. Well, it's going to take you probably
between ten and fifteen years to see any difference at all in the regulations. </p>
<p>And what else is at
play here? What's the average life cycle of a car? Well now it's approaching
twenty years in the nation. And what's the average life cycle of one of these
long-distance trucks? Well, that's getting close to thirty years. For some of
them it's even thirty-five years. And by the way, they don't throw those
engines away at the end of thirty-five years. They often move them into
agricultural purposes, or the last resort of use for the least efficient diesel
engine is now the fishing fleet. So that old engines don't go away. This tells
you that just adopting a new regulation that is technology forcing that is
going to demand a new engine design that will emit less, it's not likely to
make a difference for a long period of time, given this long life cycle of the
current vehicle stock. </p>
<p>Particulate
standards. So they revised the standard, I said '98 a minute ago, it's 1997.
And it focused health concerns on mortality studies. And basically, they began
to find that the finer particles are more dangerous. And this, I mean, thinking
about it physiologically, anybody that has had physiology, this should be quite
intuitive to you. So why would finer particles be more dangerous? Okay, yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Absorbed immediately
in the bloodstream?</p>
<p><b>Professor John Wargo:</b> Well, absorbed immediately
into the bloodstream. They are absorbed into the bloodstream. But why would
finer particles be more easily absorbed than larger-diameter particles?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I know also that
small particles can act as a nucleus and attract other--</p>
<p><b>Professor John Wargo:
</b>Another
good point. These small carbon particles act as a nucleus and they're sticky
and they attract volatile organic compounds. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The small particles
can get through your body's natural defense mechanisms in your nostrils and
stuff like that.</p>
<p><b>Professor John Wargo:
</b>Okay.
The larger particles are filtered out higher up in the nasal pharyngeal cavity.
The smaller particles can be embedded more deeply into your lung and they can
carry, therefore, these other compounds along with them. So the finer particles
are more dangerous. And we had started out with a regulation of PM 10, went to
the regulation of PM 2.5. And now most people are thinking, &quot;Wow, diesel
emissions are ninety percent PM 1, why aren't we regulating at PM 1 or even
lower than that?&quot; In part, it's a detection technology issue. It's more
expensive to detect the finer particles. More cumbersome for states to try to
set up a monitoring and surveillance program. </p>
<p>So what are the
latest PM standards? Fifteen micrograms per cubic meter. And I want you to
focus on one phrase here. These are daily averages and they're then averaged
over three years. Averaged over three years? Hm. Well, when I first read that
and I hadn't really studied any of the science, I said to myself, &quot;Well, that
must mean that the short bursts of pollution really don't make any
difference.&quot; I always thought that it was not really a particularly good
thing to hang out behind a truck or a bus on the highway that was blowing
diesel smoke, and that there must be a better way to drive. </p>
<p>So that in this case,
absolutely the opposite is true. The literature, the scientific literature, if
you do a careful scan, it's very clear that even short bursts of pollution can
have an adverse effect on the respiration rate and also on people that have
background illnesses. So if you look at the tunnel studies, for example, in
Europe, in Switzerland in Germany, particularly through the Alps, where you
have a lot of diesel truck traffic that move through those tunnels, and they're
often backed up in the tunnels so that the air quality in those tunnels is
exceptionally bad. Well Lincoln Tunnel is another good example of that. So that
they found that people were having respiratory symptoms, using medication more
often or had to visit the doctor or be admitted to emergency rooms more often
following these short bursts of exposure. So the short bursts actually count. </p>
<p>Read <i>Whitman v.
American Trucking</i>, it's a really interesting decision. The Clean Air Act,
the Supreme Court concluded &quot;unambiguously bars cost consideration from the
standard-setting process.&quot; Further, it requires EPA to set standards &quot;requisite
to protect the public health,&quot; &quot;allowing an adequate margin of
safety.&quot; So this is not a case like the early pesticide law of balancing
risks versus benefits. No consideration of the cost to the trucking industry or
to the auto industry or to the utilities can be at play as EPA decides what the
level is supposed to be. By the way, just the claim that EPA had the
responsibility to balance benefits caused this implementation of the PM
standard to be delayed for three years while it was moving its way through the
courts. </p>
<p>What about the health
benefit of the new PM standards? EPA estimated that when they were fully
implemented this year, hooray. Okay, they decided in 1997 that they wanted this
new standard to protect health. So that it's fully implemented this year. Eight
thousand three hundred fewer premature deaths were estimated to be the result.
Seventeen thousand fewer cases of childhood acute bronchitis. And 360,000 fewer
asthma attacks. Well, this is per year, by the way. So EPA was estimating that
every year of delay in the implementation of this standard, these are the
health outcomes. </p>
<p>Now, how would you
cost that out economically? Well how would you cost out say asthma? What
factors would you consider in thinking about what the value to society might be
if you wanted to put this question into a more utilitarian cost-benefit
framework? Well, one of the things that you would certainly consider would be
the medical costs, costs of medical care. So physician costs, emergency room
visits, and also you have to be aware that those that are poorest in society
have the least health coverage, and they tend to be the ones, if they're
asthmatic, that don&#39;t get routine care. Severity of response is a function of
whether or not you get routine care. And great studies about numbers of
doctor's visits related to numbers of hospital admissions. So the more routine
care you get, the less likely you are to go into the hospital. So it costs
society less, especially for people that are on Medicaid or Medicare. </p>
<p>So other costs that
might be considered could be trying to figure out how to bring your child back
up to speed in the classroom because asthma is responsible for more lost school
days than any other illness among kids. Also, when a child stays home, when my
daughter gets sick, either my wife or I have to stay home as well. So lost work
days also should be accounted. Had an interesting question last night posed
about, well what about the economic benefit side of the equation? So should you
also consider some of the benefits of prescribing drugs or benefits to a
hospital of having the profit that's associated with use of the drugs or the
medical services? So I mean, setting up the accounting system, it's actually a
very tricky business. </p>
<p>Now, this problem of
what's coming out of vehicles has to be thought about in the context of what
else is being spewed into the air. So small-diameter particles are not just coming
from vehicles, they're coming from power plants. So that this map of where the
coal-fired power plants are located, this is an old map. But I'm using it just
to make the point that there are other sources of particle emission, other
sources of combustion. Forest fires in the Western part of the United States,
in California, also produce similar kinds of particles. And so that the
background level of PM in the Northeastern United States is really serious.
Other sources include right here in New Haven, for example, the tankers that
come into the oil tank farm here in the port. </p>
<p>And why is that
significant? Well, it's not as significant here as it would be say in Long
Beach or San Diego, where you have a much higher intensity of shipment, but
these barges do tend to burn high-sulfur fuel. So that we're now burning sulfur
fuel, diesel fuel, that's about fifteen parts per million sulfur. That's the
new mandate under these new regulations. So the lower the sulfur content, the
lower the PM level. Now, however, there are certain parts of the country that
are allowed to burn 500 parts per million. And the military in Iraq is allowed
to burn 3,000 parts per million. </p>
<p>By the way, that's
why if you ever see like a convoy of the National Guard going down the highway and
you're behind them in a car, it absolutely reeks. It's because they're burning
this 3,000 part per million fuel, when your car or your diesel vehicle, your
diesel car, was burning only fifteen parts per million. And there are parts of
the country where it's allowable to burn the higher-sulfur fuels. Surprisingly,
including some parts of Alaska. So think about where else these particles are
coming from. We also burn diesel fuel in Connecticut especially because we
don't have a good natural gas source. We burn it in our furnaces to heat our
houses. It's virtually the same kind of fuel, except it's allowed to have a
higher sulfur content. And also railroads along the ninety-five. So the
railroad corridor, the highway corridor, on top of coal-fired power plant
emissions, on top of commercial emissions, these are all sources. </p>
<p>Yes, question.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Is high-sulfur
content more efficient or cheaper? [Inaudible] </p>
<p><b>John Wargo</b>: It's cheaper. So
getting the sulfur out of the fuel is a more expensive process. Question was, &quot;Is
high-sulfur fuel more or less expensive?&quot; And high-sulfur fuel is less
expensive. So it's a matter of the degree of refinement of the fuel. </p>
<p>So that in
Connecticut, I did a quick calculation and found that we're burning about 230
million gallons per year of diesel fuel in vehicles. But we're burning almost
three times that amount in houses, in people's houses. And that has not been
the subject of regulation or attention on the part of EPA. That is interesting
to me. So that we're burning diesel fuel right in the-- I'm burning diesel fuel
in my basement in my house. I'd better be sure that my basement and my furnace
are pretty well ventilated, and not everybody takes care to monitor how
efficient their furnace is. They may let that go, especially in tough economic
times like this. But your exposure could be really quite significant if you had
a furnace that was out of efficiency. </p>
<p>So particle size
definitions, coarse is greater than 2.5, fine is less than 2.5 but greater than
0.1, and ultrafine, just so that you know, a little bit of air pollution
trivia. The diesel exhaust that you see here is only PM 10. So PM 10 is just
about the limit of visibility, which is kind of curious, because most people
think that diesel emissions are much cleaner than they used to be, that somehow
we've managed to get rid of many of the smokers as EPA calls them with more
efficient designs or with particle traps. But in fact, we're producing, yes,
finer particles, but we're producing more of them. So the idea that you have
more, finer particles that actually have greater surface area to lock onto
these other kinds of volatile compounds that I was describing earlier. That is
one hypothesis about why we saw the rise in asthma in the nation during the
1980s and the 1990s. </p>
<p>So what is in diesel
exhaust? What is at 2.5 basically is elemental carbon, a smaller amount of
organic carbon, some sulfates and nitrates, and some metals. Excuse me. Going
the wrong way. Here is a diagram that shows particle size moving from ten part
per million down to one-hundredth of a part per million, or micron, excuse me.
And this is taken from Wilson and Spangler on a book on indoor air quality. So
that you see the larger-diameter particles are taken out pretty much by the
upper nasal pharyngeal cavity, whereas the lower particles do tend to get more
deeply embedded in the lung. </p>
<p>So let me talk just
for a few minutes about asthma and asthma provenance in the country. So about
seven million kids now have asthma, about twenty-two million adults. It's the
number one reason for school absenteeism. And there are other critical
questions about what it means to have asthma, what the effects are on academic
performance, socialization and depression. And I was teaching a seminar here at
the Yale-New Haven Teacher's Institute about seven years ago. And I asked one
of the people in the class what the percentage of kids in his class was that
had registered medications with the school nurse. He said he didn&#39;t know, but
he came back and he said it's about twenty-four percent of his kids in his
class had been physician-diagnosed as having asthma. I said, &quot;Twenty-four
percent? That's really extraordinary, that's beyond epidemic.&quot; So thinking
about how this has escaped public attention is really quite interesting. </p>
<p>Mark Cullen, who's
now head of internal medicine at Stanford, and I worked on an asthma report
along with a group called Environment and Human Health. And when Mark was here
in internal medicine and headed up the Environmental Medicine unit, we did a
survey in Connecticut of asthma prevalence in schools. And we found it did
range between three and about twenty-two percent school district to school
district. This is really quite striking. We also found that the urban schools
had the highest prevalence rates. So we then thought about okay, well what does
this mean relative to what we were thinking about in air quality? And this is
an aside, by the way. </p>
<p>And I just wanted to
show you the picture of a slice of a lung tissue that demonstrates what happens
to the carbon when it's inhaled. It doesn&#39;t just go away, it doesn't just
dissolve. It will sit in your lung. And I've talked to many of the surgeons at
Yale-New Haven who do sections and treat people with lung cancer. And I got
into this because my dad had lung cancer, and I was thinking about different
forms of treatment that he might consider. And I asked the question, &quot;Do
you notice a difference between people that live in New Haven and people that
do not, assuming that the two groups are both nonsmokers?&quot; And he said,
&quot;Oh yes. You can tell. You can tell by the grayness. You can tell by the
presence of these carbon particles in the lung tissues.&quot; They take certain
sections of the lung out for those that have operable lung cancer. </p>
<p>So then I started
thinking about what other kinds of background illnesses would make one
susceptible to air pollution? And they would be people that were asthmatic,
kids and adults, those with chronic bronchitis, those with emphysema, those
with coronary heart disease and diabetes. And if you look on the right-hand
side of this chart, you'll see that the number of people in the United States
diagnosed with these different illnesses, and you see the numbers are really
quite striking. </p>
<p>And you might pause
and say, &quot;Well what do diabetes and coronary heart disease--&quot; But
this is very important to pay attention to. So fifteen million people diagnosed
with coronary heart disease. Well, they found that diesel emissions have the
capacity to move through the bloodstream once they're inhaled, to cross the
blood-brain barrier, and to move very widely through the body. And they also
tend to slow down blood flow. They tend to act as a minor coagulant. So that
you can see an increase in hospital admissions for coronary events following
pollution episodes, particularly during the summer months in the Northeastern
United States. </p>
<p>So I'm going to run
out of time in a few minutes. But I wanted to give you a sense of how we
understand air pollution in the state. And we basically do this by the
monitoring system set up by the state implementation plan that sets up these
fixed monitors at different sites. So there's one right over on State Street.
There's one Stiles Street, which is just across the Q Bridge. And you see that
they are capable of picking up different kinds of pollutants. The Stiles Street
Station picks up PM 2.5 and PM 10, another one in New Haven picks up PM 2.5,
Madison Hammonasset State Park picks up 0.03 down here on the shoreline. </p>
<p>And you might say,
why Madison? And actually Madison has some of the highest reading in the state
for Ozone. And it happens to be because the rush-hour traffic in New York
generally gets to this part of Connecticut by about noon, when the sun is
highest in the sky. So you have the ozone precursors coming in from New York,
taking maybe four or five hours after rush hour to get here, and then you get
the sunlight coming down and acting on them in a way that produces the ozone.
So that the concept here is we have about thirty different stations set up with
fixed monitoring. </p>
<p>So what do the
monitoring sites tell us about pollution and how variable it is across time? So
this is a day from midnight to midnight going across the bottom. And what you
see here is different months of the year represented by the different colored lines.
And over here, you see the PM levels. And PM 2.5 has the standard of fifteen
microns as being the federal limit. That's when it's averaged over a full day.
And these estimates are averaged over a day. And what you see here is that some
months are clearly dirtier than other months are. For example, June tends to
be, in this year at least, June was more polluted than say December was. So
that there are certain climatological patterns that are behind this. </p>
<p>But you also see
something else in this chart which I think is quite curious. You see this
effect. You see a decline coming in the early morning hours. You see a rise
coming around the rush hour. You see a decline that's more in some months than
others coming back down for the lunch hour and then picking back up. This is an
artifact of the way that we drive vehicles and how we're all at quite a similar
schedule. </p>
<p>And I'm going to
leave you today with this diagram saying to you that you need to think very
carefully about these averaging periods. So I measure particles at ten-second
intervals. And they're represented by these blue squares. And if you take the
same data and you average that data over a minute, you get the pink squares. If
you take a five-minute moving average, you get the yellow. If you take a
one-our average, you get the purple. And you get the red if you average it over
eight hours. The PM 2.5 standard demands that the data be averaged over twenty-four
hour periods and then averaged over three years. So basically, the way that EPA
would read data would be over this twenty-four hour average over three years.
And you can tell from that that it would compress everything so that all of
these values would be invisible. Even if you had blocks of time, like three,
four hours, were pollution was exceptionally high. So when you put that story
together with the idea that scientific literature is telling us that we need to
pay attention to these short bursts of pollution, predominately because people
are experiencing medical effects that are now causing them to seek medical
attention. </p>
<p>Okay. That's it
today. We'll come back on Thursday.</p>
