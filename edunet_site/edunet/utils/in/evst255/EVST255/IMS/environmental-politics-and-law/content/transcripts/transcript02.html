<p><strong>Professor John Wargo</strong>: For those of you that were not here on Tuesday, I just want
to review a few introductory comments. This is Environmental Politics and Law.
My name is John Wargo. I'm a professor of political science as well as
environmental policy in the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, the
Department of Political Science and I have an appointment in the College for
which I chair the Environmental Studies major.</p>
<p>And this course is
really designed to give you an overview of environmental law, some of its
founding and key principles. But also to get you to think more broadly and
deeply about our capacity to use law to shape human behavior. And I think that
the cases that we'll go through will largely be historical cases. But they'll
be designed in a way and presented in a way to encourage you to think about
evaluating law, to think about what's worked, what has not, and why as a way of
thinking about how you might design law for the future. And the cases that
we'll look at, I'm going to concentrate on today. And these are a variety that
I've had a chance to work on during my career. And the relationship between law
and science will be a really critical component of this course.</p>
<p>There are no
prerequisites for the course, so that you don't have to have training in
chemistry or biology to do well in the course. But what you'll see is that
scientific uncertainty, especially, is really important, and how different
groups exploit scientific uncertainty, they choose their own data selectively
to tell their own narratives about what's worth worrying about. So this course
is really designed to get you to think about what's worth worrying about in a
deeper way as a way to encourage you to think about your own behavior but also
how you might encourage others to behave in a more responsible way. This is not
a course in how to be an environmentalist, it's a course in how you might think
about defining problems and solving problems to really help us think about the
world that we're creating, a world with many billion more people in it, given
our scarce resources.</p>
<p>So today what I
wanted to do was just to briefly, once again in about thirty seconds, review
the obligations of the course, which are to show up. It's important to show up.
All of the slides will be posted on the Classes server just after the lecture.
And what I'm hoping you'll do is come to the lecture, because you'll see often
just images and you won't know how to interpret those images. And via my voice,
I'll be interpreting them for you. And also, the discussion sections are
critical to the course, so that it's important that you go to your discussion
sections. And I think that all the times have been posted. Is that correct,
Laura?</p>
<p><strong>Student: </strong>They'll be up on
Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Professor John Wargo</strong>: All the times will
be up on Friday so that you can make your choices. We have eight different
sections that are set up, and we're hoping that that's sufficient for the
class. There is also the obligation to either take a midterm paper or conduct a
research effort that would produce a paper, roughly ten to twelve pages in
length. And I'll talk more about that. And as I lecture, I'll often pause and
suggest what I think are interesting research topics that will span a whole
array of different kinds of laws and problems that we'll cover. So that will be
followed at the end of the course by a final examination that also I'll provide
a review session for.</p>
<p>And I wanted to make
one thing clear about this. I made an obligation to give a lecture elsewhere
about a year ago that is up at Dartmouth next Thursday. So we will not have
class next Thursday. But I will make that up by providing you with a lecture at
the end of the course, an additional lecture which will review all of the
course material for you prior to the final exam.</p>
<p>So let me start in.
My interpretation of the failures and successes of twentieth century
environmental law is very much tied to how problems have been defined. And if
you look back in history, you'll see that problems that have become immediately
apparent, have reached the press and a wide public have often been translated
into law. So if you think about the Cuyahoga River, which used to catch fire
routinely in Ohio. It used to catch fire because of the petroleum products that
would lie on the surface of the water. That prompted changes in the Clean Water
Act to try to reduce the emissions from industrial facilities into the rivers.
The Toxic Substance Control Act evolved after concern about a variety of
events, as well as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act that applies to
hazardous waste sites following the discovery that a canal that had been loaded
up with toxic substances in New York State known as Love Canal, had turned into
a school site. The corporation had basically abandoned the facility and it was
turned over to the community, which built a school. And gradually, this
seeping, oozing toxic soup started bubbling to the surface of the playground
and people's backyards and into their basements. That prompted the passage of
the Superfund law back in the 1980s.</p>
<p>So in many respects,
law follows public recognition of significant threat that is a surprise in a
sense. But these laws evolved not in a systematic way. It was not as if
somebody said, "Okay, we need air law. We need clean water law. We need
toxic substance control law. We have to worry about hazardous sites. And what
about all the federal land management responsibilities? How are we going to
manage grazing lands, timberlands, access to minerals? How about private
development? How are we going to manage new development, new
subdivisions?" Rather than there being some sort of a comprehensive vision
about the nature of law that was specific, saying, "Okay, this kind of
problem should be dealt with best at the federal level as opposed to another
kind of problem should be dealt with by states." And what about local
governments? Which level of government has the best capacity to deal with which
kind of problem? No one sat down and thought comprehensively about this. And
the result is really what I think of as a really fragmented patchwork quilt
that's quite frayed of various statutes that are pieced together, that have
embedded within them different decision standards as well as different levels
of funding, and administered by a variety of different agencies.</p>
<p>So when I talk about
environmental law, you probably know that the Environmental Protection Agency
has a primary responsibility to administer some of the core statutes, like the
Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. But there are many other statutes that
deal with chemicals in the environment that give authority to groups like the
Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as
examples. And often, responsibility for one kind of a problem, and we'll see
this particularly with respect to pesticides, is fractured among different
agencies with responsibility to implement. So the Department of Agriculture has
a responsibility to consider the benefits and cost to farmers of new pesticide
regulations. EPA has a responsibility to look at toxicity data for pesticides
and to judge what the risk is and to set the standards. The Food and Drug
Administration has the responsibility to go out and monitor what's in the food
supply so we know whether or not people are being exposed to dangerous stuff,
chemical residues.</p>
<p>So does this make
sense? It absolutely does not. And when we get to the pesticide case, I'll tell
you a story about how I tried to pull data together from the Department of
Agriculture on what people eat, pull data together from the Food and Drug
Administration about what residues they found in those foods, pull data from
the Environmental Protection Agency together in a way that made sense, to try
to figure out what you or an individual might be exposed to and what your risk
might be. The databases were all set up in different formats using different
software. It was a nightmare and it took about three years to integrate the
datasets in order to answer the simple question, what are people exposed to? So
the patchwork quilt that's frayed, that offers insufficient protection, is a
key image that I want you to carry with you.</p>
<p>How we define
problems often will result in the effectiveness of the solution. And often the
problems have been highly reductionist in their definition. And this has also
been associated with their assignment to specific agencies. And we'll see that
many of these problems cross many different boundaries. And the absence of
thinking in a systems way, or thinking ecologically, lies at the core of the
issue.</p>
<p>So what are the
central questions of environmental law? One is the level of government that's
appropriate to the problem. Clearly, if you have air pollution blowing across
state boundaries and local boundaries, if everybody sets their own, every state
sets their own air pollution law, that's going to be a nightmare if each state
has their own standard. Another key question would be what branch of government
should establish the law? So should it be the Congress? Or should it be the
Executive Branch? So EPA has the authority to set regulations. So Congress
passes a statute, sets out broad guidelines, and then the Environmental
Protection Agency has the authority to set regulations that really are more
refined and dependent upon scientific evidence. So you really wouldn't want
Congress to get involved in the setting of highly specific regulations that
really would demand an understanding of the technical details. What's our
capacity to detect this chemical? What's our capacity to understand its risk?
Who's most at threat? What are the costs and benefits associated with
regulation? Do we really want Congress to deal with that kind of specificity? And
I think often not. Therefore, the Executive Branch, meaning the Environmental
Protection Agency or other regulatory agencies, are often given that authority.</p>
<p>When they're given
that authority and they don't do anything about it, as has been the case for
many of these problems, Congress often will call them up and hold hearings and
demand them to explain why nothing has been accomplished. And we'll talk about
the Safe Drinking Water Act as a great example of that, where Congress finally
threw up its hands and said, "EPA, you're just not doing your job, and we
are going to specify which chemicals you have got to test for in drinking
water, and you have got to set maximum contaminate levels for those chemicals
in drinking water, and you've got to do it by date X." They did that also
with the hazardous chemicals law. So Congress does get upset.</p>
<p>Regulations can be
passed by the President via executive order. And also the judiciary plays a
really critical role so that the collection of decisions surrounding any one of
these problems creates precedent for future decisions. And courts are often in
a position of interpreting uncertainty in the language of statutes, but also
uncertainty in the language of regulations. And there are highly individualized
cases. And unfortunately the process of adjudication in the court system is not
very close to the process of discovering new knowledge that we think about here
within the academy. It's not about discovering truth, it's not about proving
causality. It's about control of evidence to tell a story. So the courts really
are looking at competing narratives of what the problem is, what the damage is,
and whether or not the defendant really is responsible for adversely affecting
the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>So another key
question is monitoring and surveillance. And it's very easy to pass a law that
sounds great on its face, but if you look at it really carefully, what you'll
find is that there's really no comprehension of how much monitoring and
surveillance is required in order to really do the job, to get the job done. So
monitoring and surveillance I think of as one of the primary defects of
twentieth-century law. So we have grossly misunderstood the amount of money
that it will take to really figure out what happens when you release a chemical
to the environment. What happens if you blow it out of your tailpipe on your
car or it comes out of a nuclear power plant, a radionuclide goes up into the
air? What happens to that? To figure that out is extremely expensive. And in
society with respect to air pollution law, chemical law, even endangered
species management, understanding how many individuals of both sexes of
endangered mammals exist, where they are, what their reproductive rate is, that
takes intensive monitoring. So when these laws are passed, if the government
does not set up a really effective and efficient monitoring and surveillance
program, the whole thing is just like a waste of time. So the level of
misunderstanding of this issue, I just cannot emphasize enough.</p>
<p>Another key question
is access to data. So who should have access to data? And I'll give you a good
example of this. I'm working on a project now. It happens to do with green
building standards. And I was wondering about carpet treatments and the
Stainmaster Carpets as an example, everybody's heard of Stainmaster. Other
chemicals are applied to the surface of carpets to keep them from absorbing
stains or to keep things from sticking to them. So you might think about
cookware as another example. A lot of cookware now you don't have to put any
sort of an oil into it in order to keep things from sticking in it.</p>
<p>So the chemicals that
are used to accomplish this, including to make your clothing waterproof. For
example, I was skiing last week and I looked down at myself and I said,
"Boy, I thought this was just a nice waterproof shell that I was
wearing." And then I started thinking, "Oh, you idiot. You're wearing
a product and you have no idea what the ingredient is." And I'm reading a
report saying that almost everybody has this chemical in their body and it's
detectable in their human tissue.</p>
<p>Now think about this
history. The chemical is released into the marketplace. It gets used in
nonstick pans. It gets used to be sprayed on carpets to keep red wine from
absorbing to the fiber. It gets sprayed on surfaces such as clothing to keep
people dry so that the functionality has been the primary concern. Nobody asks
the question what happens to this chemical? Then down the road somebody says,
"Well, let's test blood or let's test urine or let's test body fat, or
maybe even hair to figure out where this thing is going or whether or not it's
there." And they find lo and behold, that it is there. And then to try to
get the chemical out of the marketplace, which is now global, is a very
difficult thing to accomplish.</p>
<p>So access to data.
I'm reading in this report about this data. One of the major corporations,
DuPont, has been producing chemicals that have this effect. And they submitted
a report to EPA. EPA put it up online. And I've got to show it to you. I
haven't gotten it up in a PDF format yet, but I've got to show it to you,
because every page has the title of the topic and then it has CBI written on it
with nothing else. CBI is the acronym for confidential business information. So
the information was submitted from DuPont to the Environmental Protection
Agency. And the Environmental Protection Agency basically shuts down the public
from understanding what that is. And it's all about how much of the chemical is
produced, what the company knows about where it goes, and also what the health
effects or environmental effects might be. So access to data, intellectual
property rights, secrecy and confidentiality, these are all things that we
really need to think about very carefully when we structure environmental law.</p>
<p>Another key question,
number five, is should we allow preemption? Preemption is a really interesting
idea that the federal government could prevent a state from adopting
regulations that might be different or less restrictive than the federal
standards. And the Clean Air Act is a great example of this. Because the Clean
Air Act does preempt states from adopting regulations that are different from
the federal standards with respect to vehicle emissions, power plant emissions,
mercury emissions. And the state of California, however, was exempted by
Congress when that statute was passed. And why is that? Well, it's because they
have some pretty severe air quality problems. There are different patches in
the country where air quality is very, very poor. And one is the L.A. basin,
another is the Salt Lake basin, and Houston, Atlanta, Chicago, New York, this
area is out of compliance with Clean Air Act standards quite routinely. And you
might think that this geographic and climatological variability is a pretty
good justification for states to have the legal capacity to set their own laws.
Some states have far higher pollution than the national average. So that
thinking about what kinds of problems are amenable to having states have more
authority as opposed to when do we want to centralize authority across all
states and locate the authority with the federal government? This is a really
important question.</p>
<p>Another key question
is administrative discretion versus statutory criteria. So when should Congress
give the Environmental Protection Agency the administrative discretion to set
standards, to judge whether or not the economic benefits are outweighing what
the environmental harm might be? Should they have the authority to do that? So
if you adopt a utilitarian standard that's cost-benefit balancing or say
risk-benefit balancing, then you're basically giving the agency a lot of
discretion to do their technical analysis and to try to figure out how to go
through that balancing act. That gives them a lot of authority. As opposed to
setting statutory criteria, saying, "The risk shall not be greater than
X," say, cancer risks should not be greater than one in a million. Or the
decision standard within the Food Quality Protection Act that the agency must
find a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from any pesticide. Sounds
unfortunate. So thinking about whether or not it makes sense to give an
administrative agency that kind of discretion is very important. And it depends
again on the technical nature of the problem.</p>
<p>Another key question
is risk averaging. If you have lousy data, data that is collected maybe with
very small sample sizes so that you have no understanding of demographic
variability and exposure or in the complex temporal and spatial distributional
patterns of pollution, then it's like looking at the world without my glasses
on. Which is, all the students look the same so that you lose any resolution,
you lose the ability to identify pockets of serious problems or high risk or
high exposure. And if you don't have that resolution in your data, you can't go
in and protect the most vulnerable, those people that are most at risk.</p>
<p>So if EPA does not
have good monitoring and surveillance data, they get to a position statistically
where they're forced to average very broadly across space, across time, and
across demographic groups. And this is a very serious problem. Getting our
system of environmental law to have the scientific and evidentiary foundation
that allows the analyst to discriminate between what's a really clean area and
what's a really dirty area. And I'll give you one example of that that we'll
look at later in the term with respect to vehicle emissions.</p>
<p>I wondered about
this, because EPA sets their air quality monitoring out in fields. There's one
just across the Q-Bridge on Interstate 95, right next to the highway. When you
go across, you get to the other side of the bridge, if you're heading east on
95, you can see it set up on a little platform. So that's a fixed monitoring
site where they're measuring particulate matter, they're measuring ozone.
Occasionally, very occasionally, they measure VOCs. So that their image of the
distribution of air pollution in the nation comes from this network of fixed
stations. And they've got probably two dozen set up in Connecticut. I wondered
whether or not you would come to a very different conclusion about the quality
of air and the movement of pollution, particularly vehicle emissions and the
carbon particles I was talking about on Tuesday, if instead of reading your
data coming from the stations, you put the monitors on kids and you followed
them through their daily life. And the answer is, of course it's different,
it's radically different. And I'll demonstrate in a few weeks why that is.</p>
<p>So EPA has this image
of pollution being quite uniform across a state or across a region, whereas the
pollution that you inhale on a daily basis coming from secondhand cigarette
smoke or firsthand cigarette smoke, coming from vehicle emissions, coming from
power plant emissions, power plants in Ohio. Generally it takes about two weeks
for particles released to the air in Europe if they're very fine to make it
into the stratosphere and to go all the way around the world and then come back
and become part of our climate. So that it's very interesting that your image
of what's worth worrying about is very dependent upon this monitoring and
sampling and how specific it is.</p>
<p>Number eight is
really critical, the burden of proof and the standard of proof. Who should bear
the burden of proof that a problem is really serious? Well, industry often
claims that it's the public's responsibility to demonstrate that their
emissions, their chemicals, their harvesting of a national forest, that that is
creating a problem. So if this burden lies on an impoverished community or it
lies on a group of families in a small neighborhood, they're not going to be
able to mount the scientific analysis and develop the funding to mount a legal
campaign to challenge industry standards. Most large corporations have groups
of lawyers. They have large offices of lawyers, or they hire law firms to
represent them. I've been involved in litigation for the past two decades, and
have sat across the table from six lawyers from a major chemical company being
deposed on a number of occasions. And this was just a very small group of
lawyers that were trying to pick apart my claim that a chemical posed a
specific threat to children. So most plaintiffs would not have the capacity to mount
that kind of legal expertise.</p>
<p>And don't forget this
basic idea that probably ninety percent, even ninety-five percent of
environmental science, of health science relative to environmental quality,
what sector does that go on in? It doesn't go on in the public sector; it goes
on in the private sector. So that corporations that are very interested in
making a profit and selling goods and services, they basically are doing their
own internal risk assessments for what the effect might be on the environment
or human health. And those can never see the light of day.</p>
<p>I'll talk on the
pesticide case in a few weeks about one compound, it's an organophosphate
insecticide, one of the world's most heavily used. And Bio-Litigation, the
group I work with, forced disclosure of a database that was really quite
remarkable. This company had spent $100 million on studies for one chemical to
keep it in the marketplace so they could understand what its risks might be.
Now, that's quite impressive. So think about challenging the quality of that
evidence.</p>
<p>Another company
submitted a proposal to the Environmental Protection Agency to continue their
license to use a pesticide. This happened to be an herbicide known as atrazine.
Atrazine is found in the wells of about thirty million people in the Midwest
right now, because it's sprayed across the landscape planted with corn and
soybeans. It's an endocrine disruptor, in other words it's hormonally active.
And also it's believed to pose different kinds of threats to human health. So
when this corporation decided that it wanted to submit its data to the
Environmental Protection Agency, they decided to do it not electronically, but
to deliver the material. And to deliver the material, it took them two
tractor-trailer loads of boxes with the data sets and the supporting evidence,
which they drove up to the docks of the Environmental Protection Agency and
unloaded. So you can imagine this regulatory office of EPA looking at this huge
sea of boxes that they would have to analyze.</p>
<p>That's a very
interesting strategy. So what would that do? Well, it basically would put a
regulatory effort that might be chugging down the road at a good pace, and it
would put it in the deep freeze. It would slow it down to the point where, oh
my gosh, this agency has to look at 1,000 chemicals. This is one chemical and
we've got to go through all those datasets and we're going to have to
understand whether or not that evidence really is supportable, credible,
replicable. Oh, that's going to slow things down. One out of 1,000 chemicals.
So the burden of proof, the standard of proof, is a really critical issue.</p>
<p>So for civil actions,
you need to remember that the plaintiff needs to demonstrate that damage
occurred not beyond a reasonable doubt, but by the standard of preponderance of
the evidence. In other words, it's more likely than not that the defendant
caused the damage. Think about that with respect to the standard of proof
required if you wanted to submit a paper to <em>Science Magazine</em>. Well,
you'd be asked questions about what's your confidence interval? Do you have ninety-five
percent confidence in the causal relationship that you're hypothesizing? Or is
it ninety-nine percent confidence? So that the standard of proof that is
applied before a decision is made is a critical issue, and this can be adjusted
if you're designing law.</p>
<p>Also national
sovereignty to regulate foreign hazards. There are a variety of international
standards set up to prevent the export of hazardous waste. So there's quite a
controversy brewing right now about electronic waste being transmitted,
particularly to Asian nations, which are trying to recycle the precious metals
out of computer equipment, old cell phones. And even though there maybe only seventy-five
cents per cell phone in terms of the value of those metals, there are some
three dozen different metals that can be extracted from electronic equipment.
And if they're thrown away or if they're burned, the material will go up into
the atmosphere or it will make its way down into the soil and the groundwater.
And also, the people that are doing this, the people that are burning the
plastic off of the electronic components and the metals, they are often exposed
at a high level. So that's a very interesting problem. How could we regulate international
trade? Well, this issue of national sovereignty is very important. Does one
nation want another nation telling it what it can and cannot import? Does it
want to demand that that nation adopt some sort of a universal standard? And
the answer is clearly no.</p>
<p>And finally, what
criteria would we use to choose among the possible legal strategies that are
there? So I'm going to skip really quickly now to a variety of different cases.
And I'd like you to imagine a society with no environmental law. And by the
way, that was the United States back in 1950, when we had no Clean Air Act, no
Clean Water Act. And how would you design law in order to assure a healthy,
productive, and sustainable future? That is a central question that I hope you
can address by the end of the course.</p>
<p>Now imagine a society
in the year 2010 as we sit here, where our law is fractured by problem and by
media. By media I mean air, water, food or by problem type, hazardous wastes or
hazardous sites or pesticide problem. It's fractured by level of government.
There's very little surveillance. It tends to evolve at a snail's pace. And a
little anecdote there, in a variety of decisions to regulate or license an
individual chemical or a new product, it often will take EPA up to a decade or fifteen
years to go through a review to determine whether or not that chemical is safe,
whether or not it poses excessive risk, or what the economic benefit is. If
it's being reviewed under a balancing and cost standard, so that -- now,
imagine this. Out of the 80,000 chemicals that are out there in international
commerce, if it takes EPA fifteen years to review one chemical, what does that
tell you about what their capacity is to manage your exposure to dangerous
things? It tells you it's exceptionally limited.</p>
<p>Our system of law
also provides a false sense of security. Because most of us believe that the
little statements on the back of different products, such as an herbicide in
the hardware store that says, "This is EPA's license," that's almost
a certification of safety in most people's minds. Many people think, "It
wouldn't be on the marketplace if it was dangerous, people have reviewed this,
right?" Well, by the time you're finished with this course, you will be
thinking quite a lot about that problem.</p>
<p>So environmental law
is also highly specialized in the sciences. And as I just said, about ninety-five
percent of environmental science goes on in the private sector. And what that
means is that they have a leg up, they have a competitive advantage in
controlling the narrative about the nature of the danger. So that thinking
about how to set up an institution that really would produce science that would
be publically available, that would be transparent, it would be open, the data
would be out there so you or I could review it. I mean, that's a big
obligation.</p>
<p>It's also highly
politicized in its implementation. There are all sorts of stories about
regulators inside the Food and Drug Administration, Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency, and how they
move at fairly high levels from the agency assistant administrator for toxic
substances in EPA going to work for Monsanto. They'll go to work for Monsanto
during periods of liberal administration, and then they'll come back into the
administration during periods of conservative administrations. So that there's
this revolving door idea among top regulators that's extremely difficult to
regulate.</p>
<p>Also, our system of
law is very poorly supported by the nonprofit community. You may think that
there's a large network of nonprofits out there that are playing the watchdog
role, but you're wrong. In fact, in the area of Safe Drinking Water Act, there
is no nonprofit in Washington, D.C. that has taken the Safe Drinking Water Act
under its purview saying, "This is our specialty," you can always
count on them to be there to try to judge the reasonableness of a proposed
regulation.</p>
<p>Generally, the system
of environmental law that we've got is utilitarian. It's balancing of costs and
benefits or risks or the estimate of damages and what the economic benefits
might be. And inherent in that decision standard is this problem. You've got
costs that are pretty easy to quantify. And if you've got a firm that's making
a product, they're going to tell you with pretty good accuracy their opinion
about what they would lose if you took that right away from them to produce
that product. Now, by contrast, if you think about the damage side of the
equation or the risk side of the equation, that's a projection out into the
future. That's a probabilistic estimate of what might happen into the future.
And the global warming transformation in thinking that we've seen over the past
decade has really been quite remarkable.</p>
<p>Because people are
thinking now out over a long time horizon in ways that they never had before.
What is the climate going to be like? And what's it going to do to our
ecosystems and to our shorelines and to our health 100 years down the road?
There were very few people that think out in that long term. So how do you
project damages out over long periods of time? Well, you rely on very complex
computer models to do that, so that you have to faith in those who are doing
the projection and the quality of the analysis. So that this problem can be
kind of capsulized in the idea that costs are often relatively well known, and
they can be projected with relative precision over the short term compared to
the harms, the environmental and health harms, that are highly uncertain. And
they're often projected way out into the future with a really fuzzy image of
how they're going to fall out differently on different groups.</p>
<p>Also, our system of
environmental law has been trivialized, I think, by the concerns that we have
over international security and terrorism. Basically, nobody was talking about
environmental law for several years, between 2001 following the attack on the
Trade Centers. And 2004, 2005 environmental law came back to life. But even
when the public is asked what do you care about most in terms of problems that
the United States faces, you will see issues such as the economy regularly
being first on that list. You'll see issues of national security being in the
top two or three. But people are thinking about a very different collection of
problems rather than environmental concern. We'll be talking about the
importance of a public perception of the environment compared to these other
social objectives in the future.</p>
<p>One other point I
wanted to make is that the estimates today are that the system that we have in
place now costs industry about $300 to $400 billion per year in the United
States alone, only in compliance costs. That's pretty remarkable. EPA and other
groups have reviewed this estimate, along with the Government Accountability
Office. That's a very large investment. So put the pieces together here of what
I've just told you. I've told you that we have this system of law that is not
working very well, for a whole variety of reasons. Now I'm telling you that
this is costing society an enormous amount of money. Well, does that make
sense? We'll come back to that issue during the term.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to
spend about ten minutes just quickly reviewing some of the cases that we'll go
through that will demonstrate some of these key principles. 1954 was a turning
point for environmentalism in the nation and in the world because it basically
taught people to think at a global scale about nature and about the environment
for the very first time. And it's the result of this explosion on the Bikini
Atoll in the Marshall Islands that punched up radioactive material into the
stratosphere. And at the time, they thought that well, we had to worry about
where it would go, how it would be distributed, within a couple hundred miles.
And a variety of mistakes were made, including exposing people working for the
military. This group of people was sitting in these lawn chairs in their shorts
and their caps on. They had ski goggles on with the dark lenses thinking, well,
that would be safe enough. There are many, many stories about workers being
exposed beyond what normally we would think of as being a safe level today. So
what you don't know can hurt you. And the more you ask about chemical movement,
the more we recognize that chemicals actually persist longer than we thought
they would. They often move further in ways that were non-intuitive through
ecosystems, marine food chains. They may get deposited in the landscape in
different ways.</p>
<p>We'll see next week
when we take this story apart that one of the major surprises was that this
material got into global circulation so that everybody in the world was exposed
to radionuclides -- strontium-90, iodine-131, cesium-137. And your parents are
all walking around today with those byproducts that often have half lives of
thousands of years. So that these are really important lessons. The Atomic
Energy Commission figured this out by 1955, 1956. They figured out that these
radionuclides wouldn't just kind of go away. And that's been the perception of
most people about chemicals released to the environment, they just go away.
Many of them don't go away, particularly radionuclides. And they move around
the world. They tend to settle down, the heavier particles will settle down
when it's dry. The finer particles tend to aggregate. And then when a rain
cloud intersects with a dust cloud as they settle down into lower elements of
the atmosphere, that's when they rain down into the earth. And that creates a
patchy pattern of contamination. It's a patchy pattern, but we can figure out
what the deposition rates were fifty years ago today, just by taking soil
samples. It's very interesting. So that you can back-calculate the half-life of
cesium-137 or strontium-90. And you see that it actually plays out in a very
patchy way that is dependent upon this intersection between the dust cloud and
the rain clouds.</p>
<p>So the number one
failure that we'll see as we go through this case is a failure of systems
thinking, a failure to think ecologically. But the Atomic Energy Commission was
clearly thinking ecologically back in 1955. But then we've been waking up over
the past fifty to sixty years without really paying much attention to this
story. So that we'll see as the milk was tested and the ground soil
contamination levels of strontium-90 were tested between the period of '54 and
1958 when more atomic bombs were exploded than during any other period in human
history, you see this correlation, this rise in levels in the soil and levels
in the milk. And then you see the levels in the human diet going up during the
same period of time, and the levels in human bone. They didn't know that. They
didn't know that at the time they designed the bombs, so that they didn't know
that strontium-90 would compete with calcium to be fixed within bone in the
human body.</p>
<p>But the Atomic Energy
Commission created this clandestine operation where they collected dead bodies
from 15,000 people around the world and they sent them to labs in Chicago and
to Lamont Laboratory and to Columbia University, where they were tested. And
every bone they tested found strontium-90 in it. And it really woke them up.
You can find this story only because this documentation that was formerly
classified until the mid to late 1990s is now available in the declassified
documents database. It's really a fascinating story. So these people were
sitting around in the Atomic Energy Commission's headquarters actually saying,
"Well, what is the law on body snatching?" They used that phrase,
body snatching. "Where are we going to get cadavers? Do we really have to
ask relatives about this? Well, what about homeless people?" So the Atomic
Energy Commission was collecting bones from around the world, and they were
able to build this map of the deposition rate of strontium-90 by looking at
bones that came from Argentina, bones that came from South Africa. I can just
imagine what their faces looked like when they saw the levels that were
spanning all latitudes and basically all nations in the world. Well, this story
gets repeated.</p>
<p>It gets repeated
chemical by chemical as EPA begins to come to life in the 1970s and '80s,
begins to wake up in this case to polybrominated diphenyl ethers that are these
flame retardants that we now all walk around with. And it's a common story that
we first find the chemicals in wildlife. Why? Because they're easy to test.
People generally don't like to give bone samples so that their bones can be
tested for strontium-90. By the way, there's an interesting kind of way to
figure out what's in your bone by testing teeth. So by testing the deciduous
teeth of young kids, the Atomic Energy Commission figured this out and they
were actually going around from dentist to dentist collecting teeth from
people, thinking, "why were we crazy enough to have to collect bones from
dead people when we could have just collected teeth?"</p>
<p>So you find this
pattern of recognition first in wildlife, then they say, "Oh, boy, now how
did it get into the wildlife?" And then gradually somebody said,
"Boy, if it's in the wildlife, it might be in humans too." And
gradually, people started testing breast milk. Breast milk became the tissue of
choice in order to understand whether or not chemicals were being transmitted
transgenerationally. And also, it's easy to collect, it is relatively inexpensive
to store. And here's a good example of DDT found in different nations around
the world in breast milk in the 1970s. So human tissue testing became really an
important way to figure out what people were exposed to. And if you know that
you find it in somebody's body, then you have this kind of interesting problem.
Well, how do I figure out where I encountered it? How was I exposed? Did I
breathe it? Did I eat it in the food? Did it come in the drinking water? So
these are all questions that EPA has faced on numerous occasions.</p>
<p>This is the island of
Vieques that we'll spend a lecture on or two in a few weeks, where I've worked
for a couple of years. And I've worked on hazardous defense sites and the
process of their restoration for sites in Massachusetts, sites in California,
as well as sites in Puerto Rico. And this is a fascinating story that led me to
understand how chemicals move through the food chain. And this is a bombing
run, 200 million pounds of bombs were dropped on this little island over the
period between 1940 and 2003. So I wondered, where did the chemicals in those
bombs go? So I took students, some from this class down. And we dove in this
bay. We found an old destroyer. We found 2,000-pound bombs that were as long as
this stage and about that wide, lying under water, rusting out, leaking. We
found mounds of artillery shells. I remember one case where my goggles had
fogged up and I came to the surface and looked around and looked and saw there
was a tank on a hill that was only about twenty meters from where I was. And
then I cleared my goggles and I looked down, and I was within about two feet,
standing on a pile of artillery shells. And I hadn't really put two and two
together, but destroyers had sat offshore and for thirty, forty years, were
lobbing these artillery shells at the tank on the hill for target practice. And
a bunch of them had missed and piled up in the same place. So they're still
sitting there. I mean, I could take you there now. We could still see the
2,000-pound bombs.</p>
<p>So the Base Closure
and Reclamation Act that was established that's closing down a bunch of these
bases has led the Army, the Air Force, the Navy to basically close bases, walk
away, and clean up according to standards that they believe are safe. So this will
be a story about standard setting that turns into a story about chemicals
moving in the marine food chain. You've heard about mercury in tuna. You've
probably heard about mercury in shark and large predatory fish. But you
probably haven't heard about mercury in the array of tropical fish that exist
in the Caribbean seas. Well, that's because they haven't been studied. People
tend to look at the chemicals in the larger fish. They tend to avoid the study
of this set of tropical fish, because these don't comprise a large proportion
of the U.S. average diet, or rather high-income nations that would fund this
kind of research would not comprise their diet.</p>
<p>So the problem I
faced in Puerto Rico is wow, I know that these people eat a lot of these fish
and there are probably two dozen that they eat on a routine basis. What happens
to TNT, HDX, which are explosives, what happens to cadmium and mercury and lead
and aluminum and copper, and a variety of other chemicals that are components
of munitions? How do they build up in fish? And is this population more exposed
than others? So that island communities, whether it's the Marshall Islanders,
the Seychelles Islanders, the Viequense, that had these diets that are very
rich in fish, they can be more exposed than others. So I'm going to jump ahead
here, because I'm running out of time. And I'll come back to these and get to
the final slide. See how much fun we're going to have?</p>
<p>I'm going to leave
you today with one image. I was up in the Wasatch last week. I spent eight days
in heaven, so to speak. If any of you have not been to the Wasatch, I encourage
you to go there. This is just east of Salt Lake City, about 10,000 feet in
height. And standing there looking out at these magnificent mountains, I
suddenly realized, given what I've told you today, chemical movement through
the atmosphere through the environment, I suddenly realized that the idea of
wildness, the idea of purity, the idea of environmental quality that most
people have and most people value, is really being challenged by the way we're
using and abusing chemicals. So that the failure of law to effectively control
these chemicals, to rain down in the snows in the Wasatch, to get into the
bodies of different species of wildlife, into the plants and the animals, or to
humans that are drinking the water, the failure to control that is challenging
our very sense of what wildness is, of what purity is, of what nature is. So
I'm going to close there and leave you with a sense of challenge that we need
to think about a different system. We need to think about a different way for
law to work that could prevent this from continuing through future generations.
Okay, that's it for today. Thank you.</p>
