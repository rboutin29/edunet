<p><b>Professor John Wargo:</b> Okay everyone.
First, thank you for coming out on such a blustery day. If you have not picked
up your exam from your teaching fellow, you can do that after class today. And
we're switching gears. We're moving from questions about how to manage
chemicals in the environment to questions about how to affect conservation. And
also especially how to allocate and manage land use and various natural
resources associated with landscapes. And today I'm going to use an example, a
history of a conservation effort in New York State known as the Adirondack Park
that has a conservation history that now spans almost 130 years. One of the
oldest parks in the nation, and it contains many terrific examples of a variety
of different strategies to conserve resources and to protect the land. </p>
<p>Now, no matter where
you are in the world, and if you're interested in managing land use and
managing ecosystems or biological resources, there are a variety of questions
that I'd encourage you to ask. One is first to become familiar with property
rights. How are they defined? Who has rights to which types of resources? And
in this case, it'll become clear that it's important for you to think about property
not as a thing but as a set of social relationships. Property is often defined
in law as a bundle, a bundle of rights. But if I have a right that's defined
and protected by law, then others have an obligation. So you can't really think
about rights in the absence of consideration of obligations. And if you violate
your obligation, the concept behind a property right is that the state or some
level of government will have the capacity to monitor, to discover the defect,
to enforce sanctions. </p>
<p>So a second question
that you need to consider is what is the appropriate level of government to
institute protective policy? Should local governments have this ability? Often
they don't, because they have other obligations and their financial background
is quiet slight in comparison to state governments or the federal government.
So thinking about the particular nature of a problem, whether it crosses
especially political boundaries. So many watersheds, as an example, cross
political boundaries: they cross town boundaries, they cross state boundaries.
Many water bodies provide the boundary between political jurisdictions as well
as nation states. So thinking about the appropriate level of government to the
kind of problem you're interested in managing is a really important task. </p>
<p>How about
participation in decision making? As you think about conservation strategies,
what should be the role of the public in participating in the type of strategy
that's chosen? And you might think of a tract of land that everybody feels is
very special, perhaps because it has endangered species, perhaps because of its
open space character, perhaps its wildness. You might think of a variety of
different strategies to protect that if it's currently in private ownership.
And one of those would be land acquisition on the part of the government. So
many national parks, for example, particularly in the Eastern United States,
have been created through the process of land acquisition and in some
instances, the exercise of eminent domain. And we'll talk about eminent domain,
where the government uses its authority to acquire property for public purposes
virtually by taking it away from the private owner but providing compensation. </p>
<p>Intensity of
regulation. Regulation is another strategy. So you might simply adopt rules
that govern density of allowable new development or the type of new
development, whether it's residential, commercial, agricultural, industrial.
And this is the origin of the idea of zoning, land use segregation, land use
density control, and often associated subdivision regulations, which are very
specific and detail how development has to proceed, including lot sizes,
shoreline access requirements--a variety of different restrictions are
associated with subdivision regulations. </p>
<p>How about the
legitimacy of public value? If you create a really tough set of land use
regulations and the property owners do not believe in the legitimacy of the
regulation, it guarantees that you're going to have noncompliance. And
noncompliance means that you're going to have extensive surveillance and
monitoring costs and enforcement costs. So believing in the legitimacy of the
public value is important. Often an educational process has to take place in
order for people to understand why regulations are occurring. And in many
cases, they're developed and adopted to prevent damage, the damage that might
be induced by one property owner on an adjacent private owner. So the idea of
deciding that you want to build a casino on your property--your neighbors might
object to that. Or perhaps a nightclub, so that there are a variety of
different land uses that threaten other landowners in the vicinity. Property
value often rises following conservation efforts. So the establishment of a
park is very commonly followed by adjacent land values increasing quite
dramatically, and I'll provide you with a couple of examples of that. </p>
<p>Density restrictions,
land use segregation, aesthetics. Increasingly over the past half-century we've
seen zoning ordinances being used for the purpose of controlling aesthetics. So
aesthetics might be managed by specifying density guidelines, requiring larger
and larger lot sizes. So in parts of the California coastal area, for example,
there are zoning ordinances that demand a hundred acres before a new house
might be constructed. This is to preserve the open space character of the area.
So thinking about how you define a desirable or an ideal aesthetic that would
be your objective is a pretty difficult thing to do. </p>
<p>The Forest Service
started pioneering research into the question of what types of landscapes do
people prefer. And they were doing this because they were getting increasingly
taken to court because of perceived esthetic damage associated with clear cuts,
particularly clear cuts that were visible because of timber leases they had
allocated. But they would be visible from nearby wilderness areas. So they
decided that they would establish a variety of social experiments, where they
would test people's preferences for different kinds of landscapes, ranging from
the wild to the fully domesticated agricultural to intense urban centers. You
might be interested in the results. </p>
<p>And following new
regulation, when does the government have the obligation to compensate? So
supposing I'm a private land owner and I have fifty acres of land, and you
develop a new zoning ordinance that tells me that I have to have twenty-five
acres before I can build a new house. So that tells me I basically have two
building lots. Well I thought that I would have, prior to that regulation,
perhaps fifty building lots that might be one acre in size. So my expectation
has been suddenly changed by the passage of law, and my property value would
significantly diminish. So under what situations does the government need to compensate
the private land owner for regulatory activity? </p>
<p>Now I'd like to drop
you down onto the case of the Adirondacks. But first, I'd like you to think
about the distribution of public land in the United States. So out of several
hundred million acres of land that are currently under the jurisdiction of the
National Park Service or the Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management or
the Bureau of Reclamation, the majority of these lands are located in the
Western United States, particularly in the mountain arid region. </p>
<p>If you look at the
eastern part of the United States, you can't see this too clearly because of
the light that's on up here. I don't know, Judith, if it's possible to diminish
that at all. But as you move toward northern New England, you might be able to
make out a patch of landscape right up in this area, and that&#39;s the Adirondack
Park. It's one of the largest intact forests that we've got in the eastern
United States, actually one of the largest intact forests that we've got in the
lower forty-eight states. And it also is adjacent to Vermont, which is adjacent
to New Hampshire and Maine. And together, these are clustered and form what is
now thought of as the Northern Forest in the eastern part of the country. And
the Adirondacks, within this zone, has the longest history of protection. But
there are the Green Mountains and there's the Green Mountain National Forest,
and there are the White Mountains in adjacent New Hampshire that spill over
into Maine. So there's really quite an unusual tract of land that has a long
and curious conservation history. </p>
<p>Again, a bit of a
closer look at the Adirondacks. Now as you look out across this landscape, you
might think of it as wild and natural. But in reality, it's the location of
intense conflicts over competing interest groups about how they might best gain
access to public lands. This is the Adirondack Forest Preserve, protected since
the 1880s. If you look back at the history of conservation effort in the
nation, Yosemite was deeded to California in 1864, Yellowstone--Yellowstone
National Park, was created in 1872, and Adirondack Forest Preserve was created
in 1885. It was transformed into a park a few years later, and in 1895, the New
York State Legislature passed a Constitutional amendment so that lands that are
designated as Forest Reserve lands, are now called Forest Preserve lands. They
are forever protected by the Constitution of New York State. So that that means
that two successive Legislatures need to enact a statute that would allow them
to be transferred out of that category. So this is a very rigorous standard
that is hard to change. </p>
<p>And by the way, there
are different kinds of laws that might be applied, such as the executive order
by William Clinton that created the largest tract of wilderness by relying on
federally owned but non-wilderness lands up in Alaska, just before he left
office. So you could use a federal executive order to accomplish wilderness
designation. Or the Forest Service or the Parks Service or the Bureau of Land
Management, they could also administratively designate tracts of land as being
wilderness that are under their jurisdiction. So that in terms of the gold
standard of offering the greatest amount of protection, you would want a
designation that would be very difficult to change. And New York State and the
legislature I think got it right back in the 1890s when they created the Forest
Reserve. </p>
<p>Jumping ahead, the
Wilderness Statute in the United States wasn't adopted until 1864. And then in
1968, the Adirondack National Park was proposed by a variety of individuals in
New York State. And this upset people in the Adirondacks quite a bit, because
they were worried about losing control. They were concerned about losing their
authority, their ability to effect policy within their park, within the state.
And this prompted the Legislature to move ahead by 1971 and create the
Adirondack Park Agency. Then by 1973, the Adirondack Park Agency Land Use Plan
and Regulation went into effect. And this really will be the topic of the
discussion today. </p>
<p>Thinking about the
forces that lay behind the development of the statute, you might consider the
Erie Canal. The Erie Canal runs from the eastern side of New York all the way
to the western edge. And when the timber resources in the park were poorly
managed, when the tops of trees were left on the ground and they dried out,
they would burn. And forest fires in the 1860s, '70s, and '80s, were really
common in response to these mismanaged forest lands drying out. </p>
<p>So what happens when a
tract of forest burns? It basically loses its flood storage capacity, the
organic matter in the soil often is released, it breaks down. So that water
running off the landscape commonly floods, so you can get a burst into the
rivers and through the Erie Canal, and then you get drought. So that if New
York State was going to insure that commerce could move westward, it had to
ensure a more sustainable form of forest management in the park. </p>
<p>Now also, think about
what was happening in the middle of the nineteenth century. There were several
movements in literature and art and also in ecology that are quite curious, and
they were colliding in a way that really provided impetus for the creation of
parks and protected areas. And one strain of thought, known as transcendentalism,
that you can discover in the writings of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Shelley,
Keats, William Wordsworth, Emerson, Whitman, and Thoreau, and particularly
Emerson's essay on nature, caused people to think very differently about nature
and what it was and its importance to the human condition. So that nature to
Emerson was an organism, a symbol of the mind, it was a moral educator, a
source of spiritual truth, and a resource for the imagination. </p>
<p>Now at the same time
George Perkins Marsh was writing, and he produced a book called <i>Man and
Nature</i>, talking about the destruction of forests and how that might lead to
the decline of civilizations. Quite curious, the writings in the latter part of
the nineteenth century presaged the loss of biological diversity, as well as
climate change that we're now experiencing. So he wrote, back in 1864: &quot;A
condition of impoverished productiveness, of shattered surface, of climactic
excess as to threaten deprivation, barbarism, and even extinction of species.&quot;
So nearly a century and a half ago, a scientist was predicting climate change
associated with the way that we were mismanaging resources and the landscape. </p>
<p>Also the targets of
transcendentalists include Christian views. They challenged the human role to
be one of dominating nature, the Christian view that we should be fruitful and
multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it, and that Christianity denies
souls to non-human species. These were new and very interesting thoughts to
people. This is captured in a work produced by Roderick Nash, <i>Wilderness and
the American Mind</i>, that's published by Yale Press that I commend to you if
you're interested in following the way that these ideas collided. </p>
<p>Now at the same time,
there were many artists that were painting landscapes both in the western part
of the nation as well as in the east, including Thomas Cole and Albert
Bierstadt, Winslow Homer, and Frederic Church. And they all painted in the
Adirondacks. So think about the fact that people were reading the transcendentalist
literature at the same time that these art shows were traveling around not just
the United States but traveling around the world, giving people a very
different impression of what it was like in the more remote parts of the United
States. So Winslow Homer has painted more in the Adirondacks than the others,
so I just thought I'd show you his work on <i>Two Guides</i>, the Hunter, and
the Fisherman, basically celebrating the experience of being the outdoors. </p>
<p>I'm going to fast
forward on you to the middle part of the twentieth century, when you recall
that I argued that the interstate highway system was built largely in response
to concerns about the Cold War. But this network eventually ringed the
Adirondack Park and it made it accessible by the early 1960s to more than ten
million people within a day's drive. So access is really a critical determinant
of property value and also the rate of development. </p>
<p>By the 1960s, mid-sixties
and 1970s, increasing leisurely time, increasing demand for recreational opportunities
led to increasing property values within the Adirondacks. People were looking
for second homes. The development industry was booming not just here but also
in the vicinity of Bar Harbor in Maine and the vicinity of Grand Teton in
Jackson, Wyoming, also in the Sierras, so that the population in the United
States wanted access to remote recreational opportunities. There was a real
interest in wildness and nature, particularly in the concept of wilderness. And
quite honestly, I'm surprised at your generation. I don't see the same interest
in wildness or wilderness that was very prominent in people's concerns about
conservation back in the 1970s. </p>
<p>So that many in the
Legislature in New York became concerned about development being financed with
international capital in the park, rapid cutting of the forest, rapid
development--particularly along shorelines--and rapid increases in property
value. In some communities, communities that had populations of only 300
people, new projects were proposed up to 10,000 new units in size. If you then
extrapolate that one new housing unit might house on average two to three
people, this could multiply the population of a community by ten or even twenty
times. So what would that mean for that community? What would it mean in terms
of its need to invest in institutional support for the community? And by that
what do I mean? Well how about road development, highway development, school
systems, fire, police? </p>
<p>So that economic
pressure was being brought to bear on these communities that already were the
most impoverished in New York State. That band of forest that I pointed out to
you in northern New England is demographically quite interesting. It's grown to
be bimodal in terms of income distribution and dominated more heavily by the
poorest. But also, there are increasing numbers of private property owners who
own second homes. But they don't vote there, they don't vote in the Adirondacks
and many of them don't vote in New York State. So that this bimodal
distribution creates a very interesting political dynamic, a tension between
those that have always lived there that are poor, as opposed to those that have
the capacity to buy the new houses and bring their conservation values to the
Adirondacks. So this statute was really unusual. And the preamble to the
statute includes this language: &quot;Local governments in the Adirondack Park
find it increasingly difficult to cope with the unrelenting pressures for
development being brought to bear on the area and exercise their discretionary
powers to create an effective land use and development control framework.&quot;
</p>
<p>Now, the mission
statement of this law is really quite complex: &quot;The basic purpose of this
article is to ensure optimum overall conservation, protection, preservation,
development and use of the unique scenic, esthetic, wildlife, recreational,
open space, historic, ecological, and natural resources of the Adirondack
Park.&quot; So within this mission statement, you should immediately see a
number of potential conflicts. How can you at once maximize conservation at the
same time you're maximizing development and use? Actually, it's interesting. If
you drive into a national forest, you'll see a sign beside the edge of the road
when you enter all national forests. And the sign will say &quot;Land of Many
Uses.&quot; Land of many uses, well how do you reconcile multiple uses within
one tract of land managed by a public agency? Well, it's difficult at best, and
that's largely part of the story today. </p>
<p>Innovative
requirements in this statute demanded an ecological analysis. So what is the
resiliency of different ecological zones? Different ecosystems? How much
development can they sustain, and is there a logic behind allocating a density
requirement to different types of ecosystems? How about density regulations and
the clustering concept? This statute relied on the idea that you should
concentrate new development in close proximity to village centers so that you
don't overstress the local government's need to develop new roads, to maintain
those roads, and also require new power lines, new sewage lines, new water
lines. So the idea that cluster development builds on existing centers of the
population is really quite interesting. </p>
<p>And this was to
protect the open space character as well as the ecological characteristics of
the surrounding landscape. It wasn&#39;t designed really to conserve energy. But if
I were going to challenge you to design today a land use regulatory scheme that
would be the most conserving of energy resources, it probably would follow this
model and it would follow the model because if you have people living closer
together, you are clearly not going to use as much fuel moving around between
shopping and recreation and school and other activities. So if you increase the
density restriction, you increase the amount of land area required before a new
house might be developed between the village centers, then that would
discourage development in those areas. And in the case of the park, inside the
centers there is no density restriction at all. So it's an encouragement
basically to build up between the village centers. In the more remote areas,
there's a requirement that you have forty-two acres before a new house can be
built. Forty-two acres is a lot of land. Forty-two acres in Connecticut, most
of Connecticut is zoned on average one acre per new unit. So forty-two units
might be placed on that zone. But only one could be placed on that area within
the Adirondacks. </p>
<p>It also required
setback requirements. Setback requirements, setback requirements from
especially water bodies, streams and lakeshores. And this wild-to-urban
continuum was designed really with an aesthetic purpose, to try to protect the
park-like character of the area. It also had a provision that was really new
back in the 1970s to offer specific protection for agricultural lands. So that
agricultural lands were thought of not the way that we would think of them
today, as providing an opportunity for locally-grown produce that would be more
energy efficient. But they were designed predominately to protect the open
space character of the park. </p>
<p>Vista preservation so
that individual vistas were identified. Actually, that's kind of an interesting
sidelight story about how that occurred. One might think that there really
might not be a legally defensible means of going out and identifying what the
most beautiful areas are in an area this large. So the Adirondacks is roughly
six million acres in size. It's larger than Yosemite, Yellowstone, and Glacier
National Parks put together. So that wandering around and trying to figure out
where the ideal vistas are located was a challenge that the park agency had to
confront. They were required to do that by statute. The reality of how they did
it is that an engineer and a surveyor got into a pickup truck with a case of
beer and drove around for a weekend looking for what they thought were pretty
landscapes. They put pins in a map, and lo and behold, these pinholes in the
maps translated into legally binding regulations that prevented development of
different forms in the vicinity of the scenic vista. </p>
<p>Wetlands in wild and
scenic and recreational rivers were also designated. The definition of a
wetland is actually quite interesting and quite difficult. Today as I was
coming in to give the lecture, I noticed that areas that normally look dry had
standing water on them. So that low-lying areas can be quite deceptive if
you're not there during extreme rain events. So that wetland designation gave
the Adirondack Park Agency jurisdiction to deny development. People were not
allowed to build in wetlands, period. Now most states have wetlands laws as
well, not just in the Adirondacks. Most states do not have wild, scenic, and
recreational river statutes that provide an overlay on top of the Adirondack
Park Agency statute. </p>
<p>Finally, the
provision that stirred terrific controversy was that the zoning authority that
previously was held by local governments was overtaken by the state government.
So not only would you have private property owners that would be highly
resistant to this new set of very complicated regulations that they viewed
actually took away their private property rights and diminished their property
value, but they also had local governments that felt that they were being
pushed out of the picture, that their zoning responsibility that they'd had for
more than a hundred years, that that was taken away from them. So that the
statute set up class A projects, which were large development projects that
might have more of a regional influence. And those were reviewed by the state.
And class B projects were reviewed by local governments but only if the local
governments adopted the state standards to apply to those projects. </p>
<p>So if you were given
the responsibility to develop an ecologically grounded approach to land use
regulation, what would you do? Well, you probably would go off and conduct an
inventory of what resources are there in the park. You'd look for aquifers;
you'd map them out. You'd map out surface waters and you'd map out setback
distances from those surface waters to try to be sure to protect water quality.
You'd take a look surficial geology, particularly areas that had shallow soils
or soils that had clay beneath it. </p>
<p>Adirondacks is rather
famous for its clay, which means that you have a clay, impervious surface that
is often only one or two feet beneath the top of the landscape. That means that
if you're going to put in a septic system--and a septic system basically means
that human sewage from a facility or a house goes down into a pipe, it goes
into a holding tank where solids settle out, and then fluid drains off and it
leaches out through pipes that have holes in the bottom of them and then down
through a bed of sand--but if there is a clay area that lies beneath the sand,
that means that the sewage is going to stay close to the surface, it's not
going to dissipate, it's not going to break down, and it means that bacterial
contamination of surface water supplies is much more probable. </p>
<p>General soils
characteristics were also mapped. Elevation was mapped, and I'll tell you more
about that in just a second, as well as land use. Where are the residential
areas? So that the idea of clustering development in close proximity to where
existing development was was a critical way of thinking about this. Now, land
cover also was considered, so whether or not the tract of land was forested,
whether or not it was heathland, whether or not it was wetland. So that the
biological resources were also mapped. </p>
<p>On top of where did
the state lands lie. So there are 107 towns and villages in the Adirondack
Park. So 107 different local governments that were upset with the State of New
York for taking their authority away, but they all had to go through this
mapping process. So those of you that are familiar with geographic information
systems know that this process now goes on electronically. So soils and
vegetation and land use and property ownership patterns, they're all piled on
top of one another electronically so you can zoom in or you could change the layers
that you're looking at instantly. In this case, they drew these maps out by
hand, and that actually led to some pretty interesting problems when private
landowners would come to the government and say, &quot;You know, I'm not
certain what zone I'm in. I appear to be on a boundary.&quot; And it turned out
that by drawing a line on a map that is really small in scale that the width of
the line itself was a hundred yards wide. And a hundred yards may or may not
include all the property of an individual. So which section would they lie
within? The forty-two acre zone or perhaps the three-point-two acre zone? It
made a huge difference in the eventual salability and property value of the
area. </p>
<p>And also proximity to
roads: I mean, if you think about an area, you would also want to know where
the road network was. You would think very carefully about how you would
allocate density based upon access to roadways. So all of this information was
put together to develop this map, which is a legal instrument. The idea that a map
might be a legal instrument is kind of an interesting thought. So that in order
for someone to know what their rights are, their property rights are, they
would have to pinpoint themselves on this map. And each color is associated
with a certain density allowance. So if you are located in the green, that
means that you need forty-two acres in order to develop a new house. If you're
located in the yellow, that's eight acres. If you're located in the red, then
you only need one acre. And if you're located in the village centers that's
designated as brown, you have no density requirement at all. </p>
<p>By the way, you've
heard about cap and trade. Well the cap and trade idea can be applied very well
to a situation like this. So that you might allow trading rights under certain
circumstances within a designated boundary perhaps within a community. So that
the idea of transferable development rights is something that we'll talk about
next week. So these are the different zoning limits that have been established
by law and have governed the Adirondack Park Agency's implementation of this
plan for quite a while. </p>
<p>How does this play
out as you're looking at a landscape? Well here is a little community, it's a
community of Keene Valley that is just at the foot of the high peaks region,
the highest mountains in New York State. And this is a community of about 800
people. And here is the village center with no density requirements. And as you
move away from the village center, you find that you're required to have larger
and larger lots before you can build a new structure, until you reach the
public lands, which begin in this case up on these hillsides leading up into
the high peaks. </p>
<p>So that you can think
about this as a kind of a set of concentric circles. It's much more complicated
than just concentric circles, but development ranging from the urban center on
one hand to wilderness areas that are designated on the other hand. So that the
public lands have their own set of regulations under this statute. The village
of Lake Placid, where the Olympic Games were held, provides a good example of
this. Where you see the brown in the center is the area where there are no
density requirements. And then the lands that border the federal wilderness
areas designated by this blue, they have the higher restrictions, the
requirements for larger acreages. </p>
<p>So where are
battlegrounds? Where would you imagine you would get the most litigation? Where
would you find the greatest amount of private conflict over these regulations?
Well one clearly would be areas with views. So areas that have high elevations
or areas that are adjacent to water bodies. So if you were going to map out
property values, you find that areas that had the best views, that had the
highest elevation, and that were adjacent to either rivers or lakes or ponds
would have the highest property values. So you could be predictive about this,
about where you're going to receive your greatest amount of conflict and
resistance to new regulation. When property values are highest, you'll find
people are most anxious to develop. The rate of development occurs more rapidly
along roadways, along lakes and rivers. The cost of developing in the
mountainous areas at higher elevation are more prohibitive to developers. So
shorelines, such as this example on lakeshores are extremely desirable from the
perspective of a developer--multi-million dollar boathouses that have been
constructed. </p>
<p>Also, hotels and
large camps on islands. There are more than 1,000 islands on Adirondack lakes
and ponds. Here's one of them in Lake George, as an example. Lake George
provides the water supply for its town so that the water is treated with
chlorine, like New Haven's water is. It's filtered in a very rough way through
sand. But it's not filtered by activated carbon, which could remove a variety
of different kinds of organic pollutants that might be in the water supply. So
in this situation, if this facility had its own leaching field, we'd be worried
about it, because most of the islands in the Adirondacks are basically mounds
of bedrock that have very shallow soils on them, that have very low capacity to
absorb human sewage, so that there is considerable conflict between the
developers' interest to build adjacent to water bodies and the concern of these
communities to protect their water supplies. </p>
<p>Another good example
over prime development land from the perspective of the investor would be a
scenic vista such as this. This is one of the forty-odd scenic vistas that have
specific development restrictions. So that it sits just adjacent to Mount Van
Hoevenberg and overlooks the Adirondack high peaks. And a developer, McDonald's
Corporation, decided this was a site that they wanted to put a McDonald's up
for when they preparing for the Olympic Games. They didn't want to go next to
Wendy's or to build their golden arch next to a Burger King. And there was a
strip already built in Lake Placid just nearby. But their vision of what might
look best in this area was something like this. Well, the restrictions in the
map, the fact that the surveyor and the other Park Agency employee had put a
pin in this area gave the State of New York to deny a permit to this developer
simply based on esthetic grounds. The developer eventually did construct a
MacDonald's next to the Wendy's and Burger Kings on the strip in Lake Placid. </p>
<p>Here's another
example of a developer that proposed a several-hundred unit condominium complex
on the edge of Lake Placid. Lake Placid, like Lake George, also provides water
from the lake to its community as their drinking water source. And they're very
sensitive about different threats to it, whether or not it's motorboat use or
whether or not it's new development on the lakeshore. This is a very large and
beautiful lake, and the water quality is extraordinarily high. </p>
<p>So here you see that
part of this complex is a golf course, but they wanted to build hundreds of
additional condominium units. And the argument that a developer will make is
often what I call technologically optimistic. You know, we can build this
without causing any decline in water quality within the lake. We will have the
state of the art sewage treatment system, we will be sure that no sewage
reaches the lake. We will also construct our buildings, which they wanted on
the edge of the lake, in a way that would not cause sediment to flow into the
lake so that there would be no diminished water clarity. </p>
<p>The water clarity
issue is often a very significant point of debate with respect to new
development. In Lake Tahoe, it's been extremely important because the clarity
of Lake Tahoe, for those of you that have been there, is exceptionally high.
They measure this by a Secchi disk reading, which is just a disk that they drop
down into the water. And you can see that disk in Lake Tahoe at about fifty feet
in depth, which is really pretty remarkable. But gradually, over several
decades, the visibility declined, and it was because of development on the
lakeshores. It was because of sedimentation and also runoff from adjacent
agricultural uses or say runoff from streets and roads and parking lots that
were building up inside the watershed. So that most communities that have lakes
of extremely high quality have this concern, and it justifies their adopting
tougher zoning regulations. </p>
<p>In this case, when I
worked in the Adirondacks, I happened to be responsible for the State of New
York's review of the project and remember very distinctly the initial proposal
and my response requesting additional information that was about a fifty-page
letter that I and colleagues wrote that we felt we needed in order to
understand the environmental impacts of this development on the lake. Well, the
developer decided that they would scale the development back quite
substantially. They wanted a marina, for example, that would be suitable for at
least a hundred motorboats. But the villagers in Lake Placid didn't want
motorboats. Motors on boats are notoriously inefficient, meaning that much of
the fuel is burned but there is a proportion, at that point in time, it was
between ten and twelve percent for the standard engines that were being used on
motorboats, is simply shunted into the water. So that slicks are common around
marinas that really are evidence of their inefficiency. </p>
<p>So gradually, the
proposal was whittled back from several hundred units to several dozen units.
The developer agreed not to build the marina. And he agreed also to put the
buildings back further from the water to protect it from sedimentation and
protect the water clarity. And the total amount of impervious surface allowed
was also restricted. So the number of parking spaces, for example, or the size
of the tract of land that they owned that could actually be covered by an
impervious surface. So these are all regulatory tools and strategies that could
be used to protect this area. </p>
<p>In addition, a darker
color for the buildings was required and building height was restricted. And
this was to protect the character of the area. If you were looking at this site
from the middle of Lake Placid looking back at the mountain peaks and looking
at the public lands that lie back here, it's a very natural looking landscape,
and that was something that was protected by the statute. So that the
Adirondack Park Agency had the authority to say, &quot;Sorry, you've got to make
sure that your building is dark in color and that it's not higher than X
stories.&quot; </p>
<p>So that what's really
driving the concern about this is underlying instincts, underlying ideologies
about appropriate uses of land and appropriate definitions of private property
rights, a libertarian instinct as opposed to an authoritarian instinct. So the
longtime residents of the Adirondacks would march down the street with the
American flag and argue that their freedom, that their liberty was being
violated by this Communist organization that has taken away their property
rights and not compensated them. So the centralization of authority has been
the primary mechanism of effecting conservation policy in the United States.
Taking the private property rights or assuming authority to control public
lands is a form of concentration of authority. </p>
<p>Also, the ideology of
utilitarianism, that these resources are there for human benefit and human use
and we ought to be allowed to gain access to them. We ought to be able to cut
down the timber on Forest Preserve land. We ought to be able to ride our
snowmobiles across these trails that the preservationists' instincts, their
concern about the noise, about the air pollution, their concern about dense
populations in wild areas, that that was something that was less important than
freedom of access and the right of the people to make use of the land. </p>
<p>So, some of the towns
already had a high percentage of ownership in state lands. And this created a
very different kind of problem. So, you know that towns get the majority of
their income from property taxes. They get some state subsidies for a variety
of purposes, including schools, but also for transportation and sometimes for
medical facilities. But a town such as this town has the majority of its land
in public ownership already, which means that it has a highly restricted
private tax base. So that the State of New York pays payments in lieu of taxes,
but these really are not comparable to the kind of income that could be
generated if development were unregulated, if they were allowed to build more
rapidly. </p>
<p>Another example of a
conservation strategy is demonstrated by this case in the town of Keene. There
is a long strip of land that's privately owned by the Sable Club that extends
back perhaps six miles in length and maybe a half a mile wide. And I should
have a photo here that would show you that the sides of these lakes go up quite
dramatically into the mountainside. It's owned by a private club. And the
private club decided that they were going to self-restrict their development
rights, but that they were going to sell those development rights to the State
of New York. So the State of New York did not take over complete ownership of
the land. But remember, I said that property rights might be thought of us a
bundle. They sold off the developable rights to the landscape while maintaining
the underlying fee ownership. </p>
<p>So that they were
able to do this in a way that reduced their tax burden. The tax burden to this
community was substantial, given the hundreds of acres of lands that they
owned, so that they were anxious to go to the town and say, &quot;Look, our
property value has been diminished, we've given up our development rights so
that our tax base should be lowered.&quot; There are a variety of different
instances where the nature conservancy throughout the United States has
affected this strategy. And it's less expensive than the state going in and
buying up all rights to the land, and it does offer this benefit for those that
feel like they do not want to see the area developed any further. </p>
<p>So in this debate, as
in many debates, who are the key actors? Who are the stakeholders that are
common? Well, there are interesting tensions between conservationists and
environmentalists, particularly in respect to the intensity of use of public
lands. So that in the Adirondacks, for example, you would have the Adirondack
forty-sixers, that pride themselves in having climbed all forty-six peaks in
excess of 4,000 feet in elevation. And then you'd have the environmentalists.
And they were often at odds about what the right way to manage public lands
ought to be. There are recreational user groups, as there are surrounding all
public lands in the United States. And these might vary from cross-country
skiers, to snowmobilers, to downhill skiers, to timber companies, to oil
companies, to those that feel like there are values associated with those
public lands that they want access to, that they can make a profit from. There
are tourist corporations as well that always surround these tracts of land,
outfitters in the western part of the United States, horse pack trip offers,
and another good example might be what happens with the tour boats and the
cruise ships up in Alaska. There are also, as I mentioned earlier, there are
commonly serious conflicts between permanent residents that are more anxious to
see additional development of the park and the seasonal residents, that are
trying to basically keep it as undeveloped as possible. </p>
<p>And there are
tensions among government agencies. The agency that existed before the
Adirondack Park Agency was the state's Department of Environmental
Conservation. And it had authority before the 1973 Act to administer public
lands. So if you suddenly give that authority and policy making responsibility
to a different organization, you're going to have terrific resentment on the
part of the agency that formerly had that authority. Just like local
governments were resentful about the state assumption of authority. And then
you have Native American claims as well that caused conflict in management of
both private and public lands and led to litigation in the park. </p>
<p>Well, we're at time
today. And I'll pick up on public land issues and also property rights
questions with respect to the Fifth Amendment on Thursday. Thank you.</p>
