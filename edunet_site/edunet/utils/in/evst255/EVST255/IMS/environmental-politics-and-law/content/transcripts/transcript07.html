<p><b>Professor John Wargo:</b> Okay, so I want to
continue the story about cleaning up landscapes that have been severely
affected. And I wanted to use this as a basis for reviewing a variety of
different laws that apply and certain key provisions in the statutes that have
met with more or less success. And I'm going to start today with the National
Environmental Policy Act, which was passed in late 1969. And it was one of the
first statutes that declared a comprehensive national policy to protect the
environment. </p>
<p>And I wanted to just
pause on this, because many people think that the idea of sustainability is
fairly new. But if you look at the purpose statement inside this statute, you
see that back in the late 1960s that many of the ideals that people now believe
and think of when they use the phrase sustainability are deeply embedded in
this statute. So let me just go through this quickly. </p>
<p>&quot;The Congress,
recognizing the profound impact of man's activity on the interrelations of all
components of the natural environment, particularly the profound influences of
population growth, high-density urbanization, industrial expansion, resource
exploitation, and new and expanding technological advances, and recognizing
further the critical importance of restoring and maintaining environmental
quality to the overall welfare and development of man, declares that it is the
continuing policy of the federal government, in cooperation with state and
local governments and other concerned public and private organizations, to use
all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical
assistance in a manner calculated to foster and promote the general welfare. To
create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in
productive harmony and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of
present and future generations of Americans.&quot;</p>
<p>This is an
exceptionally broad mission statement. This law was passed, not with any
regulatory authority, so it could not prevent human development. But it
demanded instead that any project, private or federal, that would receive
public funds from the Federal Treasury, would be required to declare exactly
what the proposed development was and to project out what the environmental
effects might be into the future. </p>
<p>The statute was also
curious in that it included something called a citizen suit provision. So that
environmental groups or other citizen watchdog groups could monitor federal
agencies, they could look at their budget and think about what kinds of
development were being proposed by Congress, contained in authorization
statutes or appropriations, and then think down the road about how to make sure
that those developments proceeded in a way that had a minimal impact on the
environment. So this was the origin of the idea of an environmental impact
statement, a model for declaring and basically making public all proposals for
new development. And also, it created an enormous industry in the environmental
sciences, an industry that really involved soil scientists, atmospheric
chemists, water quality experts that all joined together to try to figure out
exactly what the effects of new development might be. </p>
<p>Now, if you think
about the scale of our economy and you think about the federal budget and you
realize that just this past week our president issued his proposed budget,
almost $3 trillion. That's an enormous amount of money being expended that
would be put into projects developed by the Defense Department, the Energy
Department, the Department of Transportation and Highways. Even the
Environmental Protection Agency, when they issue a permit now to a new sewage
treatment plant or a new water supply facility, that treatment plant must be
reviewed in the context of an environmental impact statement. So that any
expenditure of funds demands that this forward-looking projection occur, and
it's always open to citizen suit, citizen contest through litigation. </p>
<p>And it's been very
effective in altering new development. Many dams have been stopped by this
statute, by judges' interpretation of it, because of claims of insufficiency of
the environmental impact statements. So that it also includes a very extensive
public hearing process whereby drafts have to be prepared. They have to be
taken to public hearing, people have to have an opportunity to review the
material so that they can understand what might be happening in their backyard.
And they may also be very critical of the quality of science. </p>
<p>And this is not
laboratory science, this is science that really is predictive in nature. It's
probabilistic in a sense. So most environmental science that demands
forecasting, you should think about it as being probabilistic, which is why
most programs in environmental studies have a requirement for taking statistics
and often probability. So the scientists needed to look into the past and try
to discern from previous studies what was most likely to happen in the future.
And the only way that a project could be stopped would be if the impact
statement were found to be insufficient, to not fully have disclosed what the
effects would be or to include science that really was poorly done, that did
not seem defensible. </p>
<p>So I'm going to move
on to discuss several other statutes now. But one key point is that citizen
suit provisions have been built into a variety of major environmental laws,
including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, CERCLA, which is the
Superfund law, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the cradle-to-grave
statute that I mentioned the other day, the Emergency Planning and Community
Right to Know Act, which gives communities the right to know what chemicals are
being released in their environments if those chemicals are recognized to be
hazardous substances, and the Endangered Species Act. So basically, this
opportunity for litigation has really radically changed the way that new
development and uses of the environment have gone forward. </p>
<p>Now in this case, in
the case that we talked about on Tuesday, hazardous site on Vieques in Puerto
Rico, this was a very important statute in that the court case, <i>Romero-Barcelo
v. Weinberger</i>, or <i>Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo</i>, was brought in part
because the Navy had not developed an environmental impact statement that
projected out what the long-term effects might be of their continued bombing of
the island. So this statute required-- was interpreted by a judge in Puerto
Rico to require the development of a draft environmental impact statement,
which was prepared. </p>
<p>It's kind of curious,
because I wanted to find that draft environmental impact statement. I didn't
know whether or not there might be projections of long-term damage or perhaps
accounting of kinds of weapons that had been released. So I looked for it and in
Mudd Library, the former government documents library here, we had and we still
have many environmental impact statements that you can request. Unfortunately,
you can't wander through the aisles anymore because it's been closed down. But
the university still maintains these environmental impact statements that are
actually quite interesting to browse through. </p>
<p>Well, I couldn't find
this impact statement. And then our social science librarian put out a message
on her email list and asked if anybody in the nation might have a copy of this.
And it turned out that one person on this list of all university libraries and
public libraries responded yes, that he had collected all military draft
environmental impact statements, including this one. So he Xeroxed it and sent
it to me. It turned out to be a goldmine in that it demonstrated a variety of
historical action on the part of the Navy, including diagrams such as this. You
see the bombing range up here on the upper left, but you also see in basically
the same scale, other maps that the Navy put together showing where their
targets were, showing also color codings of these areas, in this case,
concentric circles, that had the metric and the key number of bombs dropped or
pounds of bombs dropped per acre per year. So this proved to be really
important, to try to think through what was released, when it was released, and
where it might have gone. </p>
<p>And one interesting
thing is that you see that this side of the bay over here looks like it was
continually targeted. In fact, tanks were located at the top of hills, and they
were clearly being targeted, both by bombers but also by artillery shells. So
gradually, this area, this part of the landscape, was being flattened. And by
flattening the beach area at the end of that runway, they basically created a
trough, a trough by which that lagoon could drain all of the material that it
had collected into the bay. </p>
<p>And also, I looked at
this air photograph maybe thirty or forty times and it hadn&#39;t dawned on me that
this little light patch right here seemed like it was just an open area of
sand. But you can track it on Google Earth and find that it reaches down
gradually and then fades into sea grass beds. But clearly, it's evidence that
material has flowed out of that area and killed the vegetation on the floor of
this bay. The same thing happened on the other site. </p>
<p>And if you see these
lines in the diagram down here, these lines depict the bombing route, so that
planes would take off from aircraft carriers. They would fly up in this
direction on the east side. They'd circle around and come back and fly back
this way and bomb in both directions. So three or four fighter planes would be
doing this continually, year after year, decade after decade, millions of
pounds after millions of pounds, so that they disclosed not just pounds per
acre per year, but total amount of munitions so that the estimate of 100 to 150
million pounds of ordinance is basically derived from information that was
provided in the environmental impact statement that would not otherwise have
been made available. </p>
<p>Since that time, I've
recognized also that the Navy has maintained a really tough and tight
accounting system of what they did. And how would I know that? Well, by talking
to people that were ordinance officers. And you recall those large concrete
bunkers, couple hundred concrete bunkers up in the hills loaded with different
kinds of weapons? Well, they were officers or enlisted men that were
responsible for the inventory in each of the buildings. I mean, they want to
know how many nuclear weapons they've got and where they are at any point in
time. So they had kept their records very neatly. Again, this information was
not included in the environmental impact statement, but it provided a basis for
litigation. So that this type of historical documentation is often very
difficult to come by. </p>
<p>Another statute that
has played an important role here and in many hazardous sites around the
nation, is the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, which was designed
to manage both hazardous and nonhazardous waste, and included the
cradle-to-grave tracking system, meaning that wastes or hazardous chemicals
from their time of creation, their movement via ship or by rail or by tanker
truck, and their ultimate disposal had to be recorded. </p>
<p>So it was a
large-scale national inventory system. And the key to this system, just the
Endangered Species Act that I was talking about the other day or the Safe
Drinking Water Act, the core of the system and its Achilles' heel, is really
that the chemical has to be listed as a hazardous substance to make its way
onto the list. So you can imagine that adding additional chemicals is something
that the chemical companies and people that use basic chemicals don't really
want to have happen because it increases their accounting responsibilities and
their reporting responsibilities to the government. </p>
<p>It included a
hazardous waste land disposal ban. And this is kind of interesting, because
there are about 300,000 community landfills sprinkled around the nation. Every
town has a landfill. They used to call them dumps, now they call them sanitary
landfills, which is an oxymoron if anybody has any sense about what's happened
there. But for much of history, people have taken everything and just piled it
up in a landfill. And then by about 1950, they started covering it over with
soil, not thinking about where the material might go. </p>
<p>I remember when I was
young going to our local &quot;dump,&quot; we called it, with my dad and
watching trucks pull up, oil trucks pull up and drain their tanks into the
piles of refuse. People that would pull up that were mechanics that worked on
people's heating systems, and they would use solvents to take the grease off of
somebody's oil burner. And that grease and the solvent would then just be
thrown into the dump. So that if you dug down beneath any of these sanitary
landfills today, you would find not just solvents and residues of oil and fuel,
but you'd find many other chemicals, as plastics and other products degrade, just
leaching into the soil and to underlying water. So that preventing land
disposal was a very significant provision back in 1984. </p>
<p>Also, the underground
storage tank program is located in this statute. And it requires an inventory
and monitoring of underground storage tanks. And you can imagine that
underground storage tanks that contain gasoline or other fuels or oils sitting
beneath the surface in a steel tank designed to last forty years has
contaminated many, many sites. Those gas stations that you see with the yellow
ribbons around them? They basically are regulated under this statute. And they
are a product of some engineer who had the bright idea, probably back around
1920 or 1930, that a forty-year life cycle for a storage tank made out of steel
was going to be an okay thing. So what's the life cycle of a storage barrel, a
fifty-five gallon drum, for example? So this design error has polluted ground
water and soil literally around the world. And used oils as well, what happens
to that oil that your mechanic drains out of your car when you get your oil
changed every 3,000 miles? Well, it used to be just taken to the town landfill.
So this statute prevented that from happening. </p>
<p>So Vieques was like
any other community, it had many of these landfills, so to speak. And it was a
repository for a variety of hazardous chemicals. So key RCRA controversies that
have emerged include the listing issue, what's hazardous, mixtures. If a waste
is mixed with nonhazardous waste, is it still hazardous? This has been a debate
that has been intensely litigated with the idea that dilution is not the
solution. The idea that motor oils, some of them are exempted, even though
they're toxic. That's been the subject of much litigation. Household wastes
also. Can they be mixed up with more hazardous waste? Mining and oil production
wastes have been excluded. </p>
<p>And one interesting
provision in this case is that corporate officials can be found guilty of
criminal behavior. So the standard of evidence for a criminal case is different
than a civil case, a civil action, whereby a civil action would be decided by a
preponderance of the evidence, which means that it's more likely than not that
damage was induced. But a criminal case demands a higher burden of proof,
meaning basically that it has to be demonstrated that a causal link exists
beyond a reasonable doubt. And RCRA also, as I mentioned earlier, contains a
citizen suit provision. So by 1986, about 27,000 contaminated sites had been
identified. And as I mentioned the other day, now there are more than 300,000
contaminated sites in the private sector and perhaps 50,000 to 100,000 in the
public sector. </p>
<p>Another statute that
is at play here is the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act
that's contained in the Superfund amendments of 1986. And this basically gave
every community the right to know about chemicals that are made by, stored in,
or emitted from local businesses. This evolved after many first responders
experienced toxic reactions to chemicals that were stored in buildings that
were on fire. So they went in to put the fire out and received intensive
exposures. And it created something called the Toxic Release Inventory. </p>
<p>The Toxic Release
Inventory is a list of who releases what, where, and when. And it has to be provided
on an annual basis to the Environmental Protection Agency, but only if the
chemical is put on the list and only if it's produced or present at a level
that exceeds a certain volume or weight limit. So the SARA amendments
authorized additional funds for National Priority List sites, mandated public
involvement, provided permanent remedies to restore sites or to basically pay
for proven damages. It also requires something known as best available
technologies to clean up the site. </p>
<p>So a huge question in
all these cases is once a site is contaminated, how should it be restored?
What's the standard for restoration? Is it pre-human? Is it a certain
risk-based standard so that it's okay to have a little bit of lead or a little
bit of benzene in the soil or the groundwater or the trees? So these are very
difficult questions. No site is cleaned up back to its pre-polluted condition
completely, so residues are always detectible in all of these cases. State
standards apply if they are more stringent. </p>
<p>And this is an
interesting provision, because it's one of the few laws that allows states to
preempt federal standards. So the Clean Air Act basically preempts Connecticut,
for example, from having tougher standards than the federal government to emit
chemicals to the air. But unless, and we'll talk about this in a week or so,
unless Connecticut is out of compliance with the Clean Air Act standards, then
we have to meet California standards, which are the toughest in the nation. </p>
<p>So the idea of
preemption, preventing a lower level of government from passing a law that is
more stringent at the federal level of government, is very desirable from the
perspective of the private sector. Now, why would that be? Basically, you'd
want kind of a common ground, you want to deal with only one set of regulations
rather than worrying about moving your goods or your material or whatever it
is, your service, across state boundaries and having to negotiate fifty
different sets of regulations. So this is a really important statutory provision
that includes the citizen suit provisions. </p>
<p>Litigation basically
stalled out RCRA. And it stalled out Superfund cleanups during much of the
1980s and 1990s predominately because of the citizen suit provision, it's an
interesting thing. So that potentially responsible parties would then sue the
government, claiming that they really were not the primary responsible party or
that they should pay only for the proportion of the material that was hazardous
that was detected on the site. So the Superfund amendments of 1986 prevented
certain forms of litigation by potentially responsible parties or parties that
EPA had declared to be responsible, and things sped up. </p>
<p>The Vieques story was
also affected by these amendments in one way, in that it created the Agency for
Toxic Substance and Disease Registry, that's quite a mouthful for a federal
agency. It sits inside the Centers for Disease Control, based in Atlanta,
Georgia. And this group has the responsibility to respond to any community that
petitions the federal government arguing that they have been damaged, either
their property or their health has been damaged, by federal actions that are
now declared to be Superfund sites. So it allows the citizens of the nation to
basically get expert scientific advice to figure out what chemicals are
released and how people might be exposed and what the hazards are. And this
agency has played a really unusual role in that they very, very rarely in their
history, now they're twenty-three, twenty-four years old, they very rarely have
found that there was conclusive evidence that the wastes on a site, that the
hazardous materials released produced adverse health effects. </p>
<p>So in 2003, they went
down to Vieques because one of the islanders petitioned the agency with this
question. And they went about their business looking for whether or not the
contaminants in drinking water might be a problem. And they concluded no, the
drinking water is okay. The water comes from a national forest which is on the
mainland of Puerto Rico, and it's actually piped six miles underneath the bay
to the island of Vieques. They also concluded that now that the Navy had left
the island that the air quality was sufficient so that that did not pose a
significant threat to the community. They also concluded that the food that was
grown on the island and the fish that were caught in the coastal waters were
not contaminated at a level that posed a significant threat. So they virtually
washed their hands of this being a significant threat to human health. And they
dismissed all of the claims on the part of the Vieques residents who believed
that the Navy's behavior and their contamination caused a whole array of
different kinds of adverse health effects.</p>
<p>A lawsuit was filed
on behalf of 7,100 residents on the island in 2007 that claimed that the Navy
was responsible for loss of health. And the government's response has been
really quite interesting. In one respect, they responded that well, they are
protected by sovereign immunity, which basically is an argument that the king
is immune from any litigation, that the king should not be held accountable for
past behavior. They also argued that bringing a class action lawsuit
representing a large group of people like this but focusing in on a
representative sample of that group so that you wouldn't have to litigate and
develop evidence for each individual among the 7,100. The Justice Department
believed that this should be handled case by case. </p>
<p>Now, here's a
community that is well, well below the national poverty level. They had no
resources to mount a case like this. So that several law firms have picked this
up. And one in particular has been pursuing Sanchez versus the United States.
And by some mysterious coincidence, there was a convergence of this lecture and
the lecture on Tuesday and a CNN documentary on Vieques that was released this
week. I'm going to play you, if this works, I'm going to play you just one clip
from this documentary.</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>[music]</p>
<p><b>Video voiceover:</b> Nearly forty years
ago on this tiny, remote, American island of Vieques, off the coast of Puerto
Rico, a young U.S. Marine was stationed as a security guard.</p>
<p><b>Hermogenes Marrero</b>: I arrived on the
island on the third of July, 1970. I was seventeen and a half years old.</p>
<p><b>Video voiceover</b>: At age fifty-seven,
this is Sergeant Hermogenes Marrero now. He's had colon cancer twice. He's
nearly blind, and needs an oxygen tank. He has Lou Gehrig's Disease, crippling
back problems, and sometimes needs a wheelchair.</p>
<p><b>Hermogenes Marrero:</b> This is where we lived.
This is the actual campsite.</p>
<p><b>Video voiceover:</b> Sergeant Marrero
says he's been sick ever since he was stationed on the island. </p>
<p><b>Video interviewer</b>: During that period
of time, did you ever think, something is really wrong with this picture?</p>
<p><b>Hermogenes Marrero:</b> Yeah, sure. All the
time. All the time, because I used to get sick. I used to get sick, you know?
I'd go out to the firing range, and sometimes I'd start bleeding automatically
from my nose. I said, &quot;My God, why am I bleeding?&quot; I come back and
maybe I'm vomiting now. I used to get diarrhea, pains in my stomach all the
time, headaches. I mean, tremendous headaches. My vision, it used to get
blurry.</p>
<p><b>Video interviewer:</b> So what was over
there?</p>
<p><b>Video voiceover:</b> Today, this
decorated former Marine is the star witness in a multi-billion dollar lawsuit.
More than 7,000 residents of this Caribbean island, about seventy-five percent
of the people here, are suing the U.S. government. They say what the U.S.
military did here made them sick. </p>
<p>For nearly six decades,
beginning right after World War II, the American island of Vieques was one of
the Navy's largest firing ranges and weapons testing sites. </p>
<p><b>Video interviewer:</b> Can you give us just
a really detailed picture of what it was like when they would use this island
as a training ground?</p>
<p><b>Hermogenes Marrero:</b> Inside the base, you
could feel the ground, the ground moving. You can hear the concussions. You
could feel it. If you were on the range, you could feel it in your chest. It
would rain, actually rain bombs. And this would go on seven days a week.</p>
<p><b>John Eaves, Jr.:</b> The people need the
truth to understand what is happening to their bodies.</p>
<p><b>Video voiceover:</b> John Eaves, Jr. is
the attorney in the lawsuit.</p>
<p><b>John Eaves, Jr.:</b> One of the biggest
problems we have is that we don't believe that the military has fully come
clean with all the chemicals and the agents that have been used on this island.
Like depleted uranium was denied and then they admitted it. </p>
<p><b>Video voiceover</b>: After years of
controversy and protest, the Navy left Vieques Island in 2003. Today, much of
the base is demolished, and what's left, largely overgrown.</p>
<p><b>John Wargo, on video:</b> In my experience in
dealing with hazardous sites and toxic substances, Vieques is likely to be one
of the most contaminated sites in the world.</p>
<p><b>Video voiceover:</b> Dr. John Wargo is a
Yale professor who studies the effects of toxic exposures on human health. He
believes people on the island are sick because of the Navy's bombing range.</p>
<p><b>John Wargo, on video:</b> This contamination
results from the longevity of the bombing, the shelling, the strafing, and many
different compounds were released, including lead and mercury and cadmium, as
well as flame retardants, fuels, and many of these were released in great
intensity.</p>
<p><b>Video voiceover</b>: These images,
recorded five years ago by University of Georgia scientists, show the former
bombing range and surrounding waters strewn with unexploded ordinance.
According to the UGA scientists, many of those bombs continued to corrode,
leaching out carcinogens. </p>
<p>The Environmental
Protection Agency in 2005 designated parts of Vieques a Superfund toxic site,
requiring the Navy to begin cleanup. The Navy identified many thousands of
unexploded munitions, and set about blowing them up, outraging islanders who
fear more toxic chemicals will be released. The U.S. government's response to
the islanders' lawsuit is to claim sovereign immunity, that residents have no
right to sue the government. And the government also disputes that the Navy's
activities on Vieques made islanders ill, citing a 2003 government study that
found no link.</p>
<p><b>Video interviewer</b>: So, do you think
this island made you sick?</p>
<p><b>Hermogenes Marrero</b>: Of course it did. I
got sick here on the island. My bones hurt, respiratory problems, vomiting,
intestinal disorders.</p>
<p><b>Court clerk on video</b>: Do you swear to
testify the truth, and nothing but the truth?</p>
<p><b>Video voiceover</b>: Sergeant Marrero is
not one of the plaintiffs, but was questioned for this sworn deposition. He
testified the weapons used on the island included chemical insecticides,
depleted uranium, napalm, and Agent Orange.</p>
<p><b>Hermogenes Marrero</b>: Agent Orange [inaudible]
and we used to store it in the hazardous material area. It was used in Vieques
as a defoliant for defense line.</p>
<p><b>Video voiceover</b>: The military has
never acknowledged a link between Sergeant Marrero's illnesses and his time at
Vieques.</p>
<p><b>Hermogenes Marrero</b>: This is American
territory. The people that live here are Americans. And how do you do something
in your own back yard, and you hurt someone, you have to take care of that
person. And the government's just not doing anything about it.</p>
<p>[music]</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p><b>Professor John Wargo</b>: All right, now as
you reflect on that, you should be asking yourself a whole bunch of questions.
One of them would be, here's a gentleman who is now mid-fifties. He obviously
has many different medical problems. But he faces a serious burden of proof of
exposure to chemicals that were released by the Navy. So how would you think
that through? How would you make that connection? </p>
<p>One question you
might ask is, were the chemicals that they described in the lawsuit that were
released by the Navy present in his body? Well, you know, the historical
reconstruction problem that I mentioned on Tuesday is extraordinary. It's
incredibly complex scientifically and would be very expensive to document how
long do these chemicals last in somebody's body? What are plausible alternative
sources of exposure? You know, the Navy argued that heavy metals used in the
weapons were also minerals that had been driven by winds from Saharan dust
storms across the Pacific and rained down, and perhaps that's a route of
exposure. So the Navy's been very good, along with the Justice Department, in
developing these plausible alternative hypotheses. </p>
<p>Another has been the
ritualistic use of mercury. Did the mercury come from Navy switches in the
bombs that leaked out on that site, made its way into the Marine food chain,
built up, and then made its way to the dinner table and into people's bodies?
Or did it come from an electric plant that was located on the island? Or could
it have come from any fish in the area? When the Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry did their fish sample, they wandered around the island
sampling fish from many different locations. But as I mentioned, often the
sample sizes were incredibly small, less than ten in size. </p>
<p>So what you'd want to
do is, you'd want to know that these chemicals had moved in a gradient from
their location of release further and further away. And you hoped to find a
declining gradient in the concentration as you moved further and further away.
But they didn't conduct this kind of work. James Porter, who is the professor
at the University of Georgia that I mentioned, has done that work. As you move
further and further away from the bombed area, you do see these declines. </p>
<p>So key questions that
are raised by this video, what was the prior knowledge of the Defense
Department? I know that the Defense Department had very accurate records of the
ordinance that was released and where it was released and when it was released.
Another key question is, should this move forward as a class action lawsuit? If
the courts find that it cannot, that it has to be judged individually, person
by person, there's no hope that this would be concluded in the next fifty
years. The idea of sovereign immunity--should the United States be responsible?
And this is spoken to quite clearly in a variety of environmental statutes that
I described to you just fifteen minutes ago. </p>
<p>But the central, core
question here is one of causation. Did these chemicals cause those illnesses?
What's the matchup between the chemicals released, the chemicals found in
people's bodies, and what we know medically about the effects of those
chemicals? This is very difficult science. To be held to a standard of
scientific proof, say ninety-nine percent confidence that there is this
established cause and effect relationship would virtually make it impossible
for this community to recover damages. Beyond a reasonable doubt, it's a
different matter. </p>
<p>So what you see here
is you see the media getting behind this case, being sympathetic, having a very
clear story about chemical release, not really knowing where it went. Not
really fully understanding what people's exposures were, how they might have
been exposed via air or water or food. But you also have a community that has
lived in an environment that socially has been seriously affected. There is no
debate about the fact that the presence of the military put the economy of that
island in the freezer for much of the twentieth century. And the impact of that
in diminishing their income, diminishing their access to basic public services
such as education and healthcare, such as early detection, having to travel off
the island when you don't own a car to a hospital on the mainland of Puerto
Rico is a big disincentive to get early medical care. So late medical care
translates into a higher incidence of disease and detection when the illness
has progressed to become more serious, becomes more difficult to manage. </p>
<p>Also, everyone is
thinking about &quot;Okay, what is the cost going to be?&quot; What's a likely
cost for this one site? And remember the figure that I showed you the other
day, that Congress allocates roughly two to $2.5 billion dollars per year for
the entire Superfund program. Whereas plausibly, it could take up to a billion
dollars to clean this area and also to provide sufficient medical care for the
community. And also remember the fact that many of these families had earlier
generations that were plucked up off their property and moved. How would you
think about compensating them for their loss of property value? Given $25 in
1945 for a tract of land, or for the costs incurred by having your house
bulldozed and having the family move to a different part of the island. </p>
<p>So it also raises a
very interesting counterpoint to the Marshall Islands case that we saw the
other week. And that is that when the United States decided to take over the
Marshall Islands, they did so thinking that no one could survive an attack
there. They had to move everybody out of the islands that they bombed. In this
case, they believed that they could conduct their weapons testing in a way that
would not harm the population. If they concentrated them in the center of the
island and they bombed the end of the island, they weren't thinking
ecologically about pathways. They weren't thinking about diet. They weren't
thinking about airborne dust and prevailing winds. So that the idea that they
should move the entire population off the island was reconsidered. </p>
<p>There are now
available documents demonstrating that John Kennedy thought very, very
carefully about this. And Kennedy, you remember was president during the Cuban
invasion. And Vieques was a very important base for staging for the invasion of
Bay of Pigs. And what Kennedy was thinking about was okay, why don't we
completely remove the islanders and resettle them in other parts of the
Caribbean? He decided against that move. But that decision perhaps has come
back to haunt the government, and certainly is haunting the islanders. However,
this whole mess is a product of misunderstanding basic ecological principles,
as well as I think a disregard for the long-term health of the community. </p>
<p>There are a couple of
other statutes here that are at play. And I wanted to bring your attention to
the Wilderness Act of 1964. And this statute is quite interesting in that it
defines wilderness as, &quot;An area in contrast with those areas where man and
his own works dominate the landscape, is hereby recognized as an area where the
Earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a
visitor who does not remain.&quot; </p>
<p>And it goes on to
define characteristics of an area that would have to be met before it could be
designated as wilderness. But at the same time that the government left Vieques
and transferred jurisdiction to the Fish and Wildlife Service to create a U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Refuge on the island, Congress decided that it was also going
to declare the area a federal wilderness. So it is distinctive in the United
States right now because it is the only Superfund site, reserved for the most
hazardous sites in the nation, that is also declared to be a wilderness area, a
paradox that maybe you could explain to me, especially looking at the site. </p>
<p>The government
clearly thought that it would give them greater power to exclude people, which
they think they're doing well by posting signs on the beach. This is a sign
that is right on the edge of the water that is within perhaps a hundred yards
of tanks sitting on a hillside that became the target for planes as well as
artillery shells. So the idea that you could post a sign and it would keep
people out. I took a research crew out there several years ago. And one
afternoon, there were six or eight large pleasure boats all lined up about
fifty yards from this sign. Kids were out swimming in the water, playing on the
beach. So the idea that you could control people via signs, with no other
presence, it defies explanation. </p>
<p>Another statute
that&#39;s at play here is the Endangered Species Act. And the purposes of this
statute, passed in 1973, are to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon
which endangered species and threatened species depend, may be conserved to
provide a program for their conservation. So certain types of acts, including
damaging the habitat of an endangered species, or taking an endangered species
and either shooting it, by killing an endangered species, you are taking it,
under this statute. So this law, again, passed back in 1973, and the U.S. left
the island in 2003, there were three decades during which species declared to
be rare or endangered, particularly the turtles that lived on the island, were
clearly being affected by military behavior and maneuvers. So here's a list of
the species, if any of you happen to be particularly interested. </p>
<p>So I'm going to have
to scoot ahead here, so we can keep moving on. But I wanted you to recognize
that this history of military action, of training, basically testing weapons,
of staging maneuvers that preceded major military actions, it's created a
legacy of severely contaminated sites around the nation. Here's Johnston Atoll,
which is now the Pacific Islands National Wildlife Refuge. So you see, there
actually is a pattern of taking a former highly contaminated military base,
transferring its jurisdiction into a Fish and Wildlife refuge. This may look
like the moonscape, but this is the atomic testing site in Nevada, where you
can see the craters that are the result of hundreds of other above ground
tests. Here's another highly contaminated site in Hanford, Washington. The
Hanford Works, the site of the Green Run, that you could read about in <i>Green
Intelligence</i>. The underground storage tanks, the same problem that I
mentioned earlier in the lecture, leaking radioactive waste that is highly
concentrated into the Columbia River. The Columbia River is a habitat for
Pacific salmon and many other species of fish. And it's a very highly prized
region. </p>
<p>The military
reservation on Cape Cod provides one more example. This reservation has a
history that spanned just about the same amount of time as Vieques, from about
1940 to just about the year 2000, 2001 actually. The jets that we're trying to
catch up to on the September 11, 2001, hijackers, they were scuttled from the
Massachusetts military reservation on Cape Cod. This site is sitting on sands
and gravels. And it's basically a collection of very large aquifers on Cape
Cod, in which the freshwater sits on top of underlying saltwater the closer you
get to the ocean. So that anything put on the surface will drain into
underlying sands and aquifers moving very quickly. </p>
<p>So this has become
the largest drinking water contamination site and remediation site in the
United States now. They drilled some 8,000 different wells to try to figure out
where the fuels, the flame retardants, the munitions residues, the TNT and RDX,
etc., where did it go? And they've monitored it out, and they created these
plumes that pump the water up, out of that aquifer and then into these charcoal
tanks, activated carbon tanks, some of which are bigger than this entire
lecture hall. So day after day, twenty-four hours a day, decade for decade,
this water is pumping through there, hoping that it will be cleaned up to meet
the Safe Drinking Water Act standards by the year 2035. Three thousand pounds
of solvents have been removed from that water. One thousand pounds of fuels was
removed from the groundwater. And eight plumes are now undergoing treatment and
remediation. This is immediately adjacent to a variety of cranberry bogs, so
cranberry farmers bore the brunt of economic loss when this was discovered. </p>
<p>So critical lessons
here about Vieques, knowledge is power, that's very clear. Classified
information prevents the public from understanding what was done, when and
where, what the nature of surrounding or nearby community threats might be. A
question of who conducts the science. It's clear that the ATSDR who are within
the Centers from Disease Control, was not doing high quality science and came
to a premature conclusion of safety based upon a highly limited sampling.
Science normally proves no causal relation. So this type of science is perhaps
one of the more complex that I could imagine. </p>
<p>Also one lesson here
that is apparent is that new evidence of risky behavior generates a very
defensive attitude on the part of government. So any information that they
release, any studies that they conduct, could increase their liability. So
often the response is &quot;Well, then let's just not study it.&quot; </p>
<p>Okay. I'm going to
pause there, and just wish you a great weekend.</p>
