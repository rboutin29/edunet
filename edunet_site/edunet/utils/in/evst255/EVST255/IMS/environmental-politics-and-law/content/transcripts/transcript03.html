<p><b>Professor John Wargo:
</b>Okay,
let me start in. This lecture is about national security, and it's about the
conflict that's involved during the twentieth century between national security
and environmental quality and human health. So I want to explore that, because
so much money in the world is spent on national security, and it has the
potential to invade individual rights, to diminish personal freedom, to
diminish privacy. At the same time, it has the potential to concentrate power
and authority among elites, political elites, wealthy elites, technical elites,
so that it's threatening to democratic participation and policy making in a
variety of ways. And as we move through the course, you'll find that secrecy is
not just an issue that we need to figure out how to manage better in the public
sector relative to classified information, and this is the topic of today's
session. But it's also a critical issue in the private sector. The growing use
of confidential business information, the growing obscurity of product
ingredients as globalized markets cause products and services to cross national
borders without any clear identity about components or potential effects. </p>
<p>So national security
and environmental quality. I want you to think about this case and other cases
that we deal with as a problem of managing intelligence. I'm not meaning to
imply that other people are not intelligent, I'm meaning to hopefully get you
to think about the idea of a legal system that would produce a public that was
literate and capable of understanding the quality of the environment around
them, what's threatening and what's not, so that potentially they could manage
their exposure to chemicals, they could manage the effect of human behavior on
a variety of environmental issues, such as endangered species. So the purpose
for the title of my book that I'm having you read, you poor things, is the idea
of thinking about the origin of knowledge. You know, where do we get the
information? Where do we get the data? Where do we get the knowledge? Who
produces it? </p>
<p>And what we'll see
today is that knowledge about the environmental effects of national security
are produced predominately by the Defense Department. They control sites, they
control the technology in weaponry and weapon delivery systems, making it
extremely difficult for the public to understand really what the dangers might
be. Where does the knowledge flow? Is it intelligible? Is it understood? The
distinction between is it intelligible and is it understood is really critical.
It involves literacy, it involves educational background, technical competence.
And who owns it? This is really a key question for law. You can think about
this in terms of it being an intellectual property right question. Should the
public own it? Should the government be able to keep the knowledge from the
public? Should the private sector be allowed to own it, and should they be
allowed to keep knowledge from the public? So think about it as a problem of
understanding production and flow of knowledge. Because environmental quality
is always going to be elusive until we create a public that really is far more
intelligent, so to speak, understanding, than it currently is. </p>
<p>So what are the purposes
of secrecy? I'm kind of fascinated by the growing classification of information
in the public sector. So that in U.S. history, never before has the government
been classifying more information than it is today. You know, at the same time,
there's a very interesting cultural change that we're witnessing in your
generation related to Facebook. I mean, I have never seen a generation be so
interested in revealing secrets or information about themselves as your
generation is. So it&#39;s a disconnect in a way between government policy and
what's going on in social circles among younger generations. How do terror and
warfare depend upon secrecy? When does secrecy threaten national security? When
is secrecy necessary for national security? And how is it related to individual
rights? These are key questions that I hope you'll keep in mind as we move
through this lecture today. </p>
<p>There are common
scripts in environmental history, no matter whether or not you consider this
case or the case of endangered species, the case of managing water quality,
managing sustainable agriculture. Who knew about the problem? Who knew about
contaminants in this case? When did they know? When did they inform the public?
And what did they do about the problem? These are critical questions, and
secrecy is a central component of all of them. </p>
<p>So that the history
that I want to go through today is really one that is very brief. It only spans
the period between 1944 and 1963. So in this period, the atomic weapons, the
first atomic weapons were designed and tested, the first one at Los Alamos in
New Mexico in 1945, followed by two uses of atomic weapons, the only two
aggressive uses in world history. One on Hiroshima and the other on Nagasaki,
killing hundreds of thousands of people and resulting in injuries and death,
inheritable mutations that have affected generations of Japanese. So this
compressed period is really quite striking. </p>
<p>Now, why in the world
would we be talking about this issue, which seems so old now, it's part of the
Cold War, in a class on current environmental law and policy? Well, I'll tell
you a bit of a story. In 2003, I was in the Beinecke Rare Book Library. And I
don't know if you have visited the Beinecke Library, but it really is a
remarkable place. It's got a wonderful, rich store of information, especially
on the American West. But I found out just by surfing the net that they also
have all of Rachel Carson's original research material. Now, Rachel Carson
wrote &quot;Silent Spring&quot; and &quot;The Sea Around Us&quot; and a number
of other books, and is rather famous in environmental history, particularly for
her work trying to get the public to wake up about the dangers of pesticides,
especially related to wildlife because she was a wildlife biologist working for
the Fish and Wildlife Service. Well it turns out that all of her original
research materials, including about 120 boxes of material, are stored in the
basement of Beinecke Library. So going through those, as I was trying to
understand the history of pesticides, I found one file that was on nuclear
weapons testing. And that file was incredibly dense. And as she conducted her
research, by the way, it's very different than what we do today when our
research is almost all electronic. She would hand copy material, there were no
copy machines that she had access to at that point in time. And then she would
write notes, little side notes interpreting it as she went along. </p>
<p>So going through
this, I realized that all of her work on pesticides where she wondered what
happened to them once they were released. Where they went, how did they make
their way into the soil? Why were wildlife, the canaries in the mine in a
sense, what were the wildlife telling us about human hazards and human risk?
And what was wrong with current law and policy that would allow that kind of
release and non-accountability on the part of the private sector? So she
learned that way of thinking, that narrative logic, she learned that, not by
studying pesticides, by looking at the history of the Atomic Energy Commission
in the 1950s and how they came to understand radionuclides and what happened to
them and the kind of threat they posed to water quality, to air quality, how
they got into wildlife, how they got into human tissue. So this is a story of
today. </p>
<p>So the idea that the
success in any of these cases is dependent upon very high quality science is a
very important idea. And remember what I said the other day, that perhaps
ninety-five percent of the science in the field of environmental science is
conducted in the private sector, it never sees the light of day. Well in this
case, this is probably the best example of state science at an enormous scale.
The Atomic Energy Commission had an unlimited budget, they had unlimited
authority, and they had unlimited capacity to tell a story about danger and the
importance of pursuing atomic weapons development in order to protect national
security. </p>
<p>So this time span
just gives you the number of tests per year between 1945, or actually, the
number of explosions, 1945 and 1962. In 1963, President Kennedy worked with the
Soviets to pass the Limited Test Ban Treaty. And since that time, atmospheric
testing has been severely limited. Known nuclear tests worldwide between '45
and '96, roughly about 2,000, maybe about 2,400. After 1963, the majority of
tests, or the number of tests actually went up. But most of them went
underground. So underground testing is allowed, and we'll see later on in the
lecture that there have been certain parts of the world, it's been agreed among
nations that have this nuclear capacity to avoid testing. So outer space is now
off limits. Testing in the South Pacific is now off limits because it was the
site of many highly intense tests of hydrogen bombs. And also, testing on the
poles is restricted by international agreement. </p>
<p>So this was a very
limited period of time, and many people don't understand where these tests were
conducted. Some in the South Atlantic, some in Mississippi, some in Japan, New
Mexico, the Pacific Ocean, the Nevada Test Site, Johnson Island, Christmas
Island, Eniwetok and Bikini, which are part of the Marshall Islands in the
Pacific. I'll be speaking more about this and show you some film clips on next
Tuesday when we reconvene. </p>
<p>One interesting
aspect of this history was the behavior of Klaus Fuchs, who was a theoretical
scientist working at Los Alamos on the development of the first weapon, the
first atomic bomb, during what is known as the Manhattan Project. And he had
access to top-secret material. A very highly skilled physicist, and he passed
most of what he knew on to the Soviets in the late 1940s. So he was tried and
convicted of espionage in Britain in the 1950s, and he served nine years out of
a fourteen-year sentence. This is fascinating to me. Think about the nature of
the sanction here. So that the Soviets gained their understanding of how the
U.S. produced nuclear weapons and gained an understanding of what our strategy
was, how we were testing it, how we were monitoring the effects, what the
intensity of the radiation was. And the man serves only nine years in prison. </p>
<p>The lesson is kind of
curious. Most secrets have very short lives, and the more valuable they are,
the more limited is their life. So I think about the idea of creating a secret
as creating a property right. And so it creates a property right and its value
is dependent on many aspects of its character, and we'll explore that as we
move through. The power of explosions on the Bikini Atoll in the South Pacific
is something to take note of. Next Tuesday, we'll come back to this story,
where the Bikini Islanders were removed from their island through negotiation
and the use of eminent domain. And then the U.S. proceeded to test about
twenty-five, twenty-six different nuclear weapons, including the Bravo Test in
1954 that I'll show you a clip of, which was one of the largest bombs ever
exploded by the U.S. in the atmosphere. </p>
<p>The Atomic Energy
Commission created what they called Project Gabriel that evolved to be called
Project Sunshine--that lasted between 1949 and 1961. So Project Sunshine became
famous, and it was the collection of scientists in the government working with
the Atomic Energy Commission based predominately at the University of Chicago
and Columbia University, the Lamont Laboratories. So scientists were given
virtually unlimited funds to conduct research that would help the Atomic Energy
Commission understand the power of their different weapons. And there were some
200 different types of nuclear weapons eventually that were designed. And some
so large that they had to redesign aircraft in order to handle the weight, and
others so small that they could be tactically carried in a suitcase and be used
under field conditions that were very difficult. Different delivery mechanisms,
delivery by aircraft, delivery by missile, delivery by artillery, delivery by
suitcase, so that a variety of different types of bombs of different strengths
were designed for different types of warfare. </p>
<p>So the Sunshine
scientists really ramped up in the early 1950s. And what's interesting is the
way that they thought about environmental science. They wondered what happened
to the radionuclides. Where do they go when a bomb explodes, what happens?
Well, dust particles get blown up into the atmosphere. If you drop a bomb in
shallow water, it will take the material on the bottom of the water and will
take the fish and it will basically blow everything up and the coral up into
the atmosphere. It will also kill any birds that are in close proximity. So
every test has a story about birds raining from the sky, on fire. It will also
cause a pattern of movement in the atmosphere that depends very much upon
climate and wind conditions. And the power of the bomb determines how high up
into the atmosphere the particles get. So dozens and dozens of different
nuclides were created, some of which had never been recognized before. </p>
<p>So trying to figure
this out, one of the first things they did was they set up a monitoring system.
That made sense. If you want to figure out where something is going, you set up
a monitoring system. In this case, it was rather simplistic, around the Nevada
Test Site north of Las Vegas, about sixty-five miles. And people used to
cluster on tops of the casinos and the hotels in the evening to watch the bombs
explode, or get up really early in the morning to watch the bombs explode,
highly visible, given the clear climate. So they set up their monitors and they
presumed that they had captured the dispersal of radiation. </p>
<p>And then they began
to get reports. Reports came in from different parts of the country, some in
North Dakota from people that were mining for uranium that had carried Geiger
counters. And one miner was telling a story where he was eating dinner at his
campfire with his Geiger counter that he forgot to turn off. And the Geiger
counter started to spit back at him, [stuttering noise]. And he
said, &quot;Oh boy, you know, I've got to have this thing serviced. It must be
out of tune, it must be detecting something that is not there.&quot; So he took
it in to have it serviced and found out that it was actually in great tune,
didn't need to be recalibrated. He went back to his site and it happened again.
So he realized gradually that something was going on in the atmosphere. It
wasn't measuring anything in the mine or in nearby rock because it normally in
that place would be silent. He was picking up radionuclides that were raining
down in North Dakota. </p>
<p>Polaroid became
important in the process of understanding the distribution, Polaroid Film
Company, because its film was found to be exposed when it arrived at doctors'
offices and hospitals in different parts of the world. And at that point in
time, they used to put the Polaroid film, the eight-and-a-half by eleven
sheets, into boxes. And then they would pack the boxes, you know, not with
these Styrofoam kernels that we use today that will never go away. But instead,
they used to pack it with cornhusks. So gradually, they figured it out because
they could see in some cases the image of the cornhusk on top of the film
matching directly. So what was happening? </p>
<p>Well, the
radionuclides were intersecting a cloud, they were raining down, in this case
in the Midwestern part of the United States, where the box had been packed. And
the cornhusks were exposing the film, because they had absorbed the
radionuclides. So they realized gradually that their donut 200 miles in
diameter around Las Vegas was completely inappropriate to capture the scale of
this problem. This is a very important lesson in environmental science and
environmental policy. It's like the analogy of the drunk leaning on a light
post looking for his car keys. Why is he looking under the light post? That's
because that's where the light is. So that there are many, many different
stories about the failure of environmental science and the ineffectiveness of
environmental law that flow from this problem of misunderstanding the need for
a very sensitive sampling design. </p>
<p>In this case, the
Stokes test in 1957 put radionuclides into the atmosphere, but they started
moving at different directions at different altitudes. Ooh, there's an
interesting idea, that's novel. No one thought about that before. So here, the
dashed line at the bottom is moving at 30,000 feet, and it just nicks the
southeast side of Idaho. Whereas the dust at 10,000 feet shoots all the way up
to Montana. Then it arcs up over southern Canada, comes back over the Great
Lakes. Then you see that arc of the dashed line coming right down across Lake
Champlain on the New York-Vermont border, the Massachusetts-New York border,
and then the Connecticut border. Well that's pretty interesting. </p>
<p>Another test that
they followed created dust clouds that again were driven by weather patterns.
And you see in this case that at 30,000 feet, one swirled around Texas for
about a week. Another one swooped all the way at 20,000 feet down into Florida,
and probably would have been detected if they had rainstorms in Florida at the
time of the dust cloud that got there, that would have been detectable in
oranges, in orange juice, and in orange oils. So that crops were being
threatened and exposed in a variety of different ways that were being driven by
weather patterns. And we all know that even today, it's hard to predict what
the weather's going to be within thirty-six hours in many parts of the country.
So that the state of weather forecasting back at this time was quite primitive.
So that basically told these scientists, and then again, I can just imagine
what they were doing, sitting across the table looking at each other. How are
we going to manage this? What's going to happen if the public understands this?
How are we going to maintain our political support for the weapons testing
program so that we can keep on building these weapons to contain the Soviets or
to strike fear into their hearts? Following their policy of deterrence, the
bigger the bomb, the less likely we are to be attacked by other nations that
would understand that an attack would be simply suicide. </p>
<p>Well, here is a chart,
which is an amalgamation of different bomb blasts and the pathways that they
took, and the darkest areas are areas that received the highest doses of
radiation. And these nuclides have half-lives that vary between roughly three
to four weeks up to forty, fifty, a hundred years. So that if you went to the
center of the country in Iowa and you took tests of the soil, you could still
detect many of these radionuclides in the soil. And they are transferable from
soil to crops and up to fruits. So that this patchiness and fallout was
eventually recognized by the Atomic Energy Commission in the mid-1950s. And
gradually, once this information was declassified in the early 1990s, and the
only reason I'm telling you this story is because most of this knowledge was
eventually declassified. I couldn't be here, which is kind of an interesting
thought, I couldn't be here right now telling you this story had the
declassification process not occurred under the Clinton Administration. Once
they realized that the Atomic Energy Commission had kept all this information
from the public, when they really had no national security logic to do so. </p>
<p>So here is a map of
the United States constructed by the National Cancer Institute in the late
1990s, that took the dose estimates that they got from the soils, because they
could back calculate the concentrations from existing concentrations, knowing
the decay rate of different nuclides. And they developed this map of expected
doses. And then the Cancer Institute started asking questions, because they
understood the dose-response relationship for radiation and these nuclides is
really pretty clear. This not like you have to drink 10,000 cans of diet soda
to absorb enough saccharine to elevate your cancer risk a little bit. This is a
science that evolved in the 1950s largely because of the importance to the
military that understood the dose-response relationship quite clearly. But
understanding a dose-response relationship, meaning, let's see, the best way to
explain dose-response relationship if it's not familiar to you, especially for
college students, is to think about a six-pack of beer. So you get a six-pack
of beer, you have one beer. You might feel a little bit of it. You have two
beers within fifteen minutes. I know you'd never do that. You have three beers
within twenty minutes. You have six beers within an hour so that the effect
that you feel, the effect on your body, depends upon the dose and the
concentration that you're actually circulating in your system. </p>
<p>So they understood
this relationship with great clarity with respect to these radionuclides, so
that the cancer estimates really are quite robust. One interesting thing is
that if you look at the pattern of testing that really, it peaked in the late
1950s so that you see this is radionuclides in rainwater. And then there was an
agreement not to test for a period of two years. And you see that the rainwater
levels declined. It's in the rainwater. Hmm, that's interesting. If it's in the
rainwater, what does that mean for fish? What does it mean for rivers? What
does it mean for parts of the West that experience high levels of snowpack? </p>
<p>Well, it means that
snowpack, for example, Jackson, Wyoming a couple years ago. Jackson Hole,
Wyoming received more than 600 inches of snow in one year. And in a matter of
about a month in the period between April and late May, you get basically
warmer weather melting all the snow. So in this period of time you get this
rush, you get this pulse of radioactive water that moves into a stream. And lo
and behold, where could you test that? Well, you could test that in the
supermarket. Where? In what supermarket? In the salmon in supermarkets, the
trout in the supermarket. Buying trout in the supermarket. You could find these
levels increasing in the Columbia River that goes by the Hanford uranium
enrichment plant, plutonium enrichment plant in the state of Washington. So the
water levels, concentrations were going up because the rainwater concentrations
were going up, and the fish concentrations were going up. And also, people that
were drinking water out of wells that were fed underground by the aquifer from
the Hanford area, they were also being exposed. The per capita dose was
calculated as well, and you see the dip between January of 1960 and late 1962
during the agreed cessation of testing. So this information was really quite
robust. </p>
<p>So Project Sunshine
basically pieced together this idea that these nuclides were in global
circulation, they were contaminating every aspect of our environment, and they
were making their way into humans, and particularly they were concerned about
strontium-90, because if you have a diet that is low in calcium, your body's
going to absorb more strontium-90 into your bone. Also, if you have a diet
that's low in iodine, your thyroid is going to absorb more iodine-131 than it normally
would. So understanding this relationship between calcium and strontium-90 is
very important, because it eventually led to calcium enrichment of breads, of
milk. So the fortification program really had its origination in
recommendations by the Atomic Energy Commission. So the public thought, oh,
we're just getting more minerals in our diet. Well, that must be a good thing,
the nutritionists must be arguing that this makes a lot of sense. But in
reality, what was going on was that the Atomic Energy Commission was anxiously
wringing its hands recognizing that they've got to figure out how to lower the
dose being experienced in the population. The population had no idea what was
going on. </p>
<p>So Project Sunshine
scientists, they eventually obtained 15,000 bodies, dead bodies, trying to
understand the distribution of these nuclides throughout the world. Bodies from
New York, San Francisco, Houston, Japan, India, South Africa. Why from other
nations? Well, predominately because they were worried about other nations
coming back and telling the United States that we were contaminating not only
their food supplies, which was going to harm their ability to trade products
internationally, processed foods, water, just about any kind of crop you could
think of, as well as animals. So that gradually over the period between 1955
and 1960, the Atomic Energy Commission grew to really understand the global
distributional pattern and how people in certain areas of Latin America and
tropical areas were really experiencing quite high levels of fallout. Why would
that be? In tropical rainforests, they experience intense rainfall. So that the
rain was so high that it would concentrate the nuclides in some of the tropical
forest areas. </p>
<p>So permission to take
the body parts was never sought or obtained. Family members were never
consulted. Bones were cleaned and packaged in formalin. And then they were
crushed and analyzed by laboratory technicians at Columbia and other
prestigious U.S. academic institutions. And sometimes the bones were pooled
together. Gradually they decided that they were going to look for geographic
variability and they were going to look for age-related variability. Because
they were finding that kids, for some reason, were absorbing more of the
radionuclides, especially strontium, than adults were. So why would that be?
Was it something about their diet? Was there something about their physiology?
Well, it had to do with their rate of growth of bone. So kids are growing most
rapidly at what point in their lives? Well, from time of conception roughly
until the time of thirteen. But different organ systems and different functions
in the body mature at different rates. So stature, for example, is quite
linear, although you get this really serious growth curve in utero. And then it
goes up gradually, gradually, and then more steeply during the early teenage
years. So you could figure out the concentrations that were correlated with
these periods of rapid growth and development. </p>
<p>So gradually, these
secrets started to leak out. And the U.S. began to study fallout data. And once
the Soviets had developed their own capacity to make and test nuclear weapons,
the Atomic Energy Commission had this great argument. Well, there are nuclides
in our food supply and in our bodies, it's not our fault. Well, we take some
responsibility, but it's the Soviets' fault. The Soviets were actually testing
these weapons up in Siberia. And the Siberian radionuclides tended to come down
across Alaska and across Canada and into the Western and Midwestern part of the
U.S., so in threads that are similar to the ones that I showed you from the
Nevada test site. So the U.S. was trying to at this point desperately maintain
public support for continued testing, in part because they were wondering well,
what would happen if we did have a nuclear war? Where would the nuclides go?
And what would our capacity to respond be? So these were legitimate national
security concerns that they were exploring. </p>
<p>So the U.S. began to
release some of its information at the same time that states started their own
testing programs. So just like you find variability in air pollution today from
motor vehicles, depending upon climate and where vehicle use is most intense,
you find in this case states being worried about specific patterns of
concentration in the crops that they grow. Vermont cheese, for example, or
Midwestern grains or cattle grazed in the Western U.S. So Minnesota, Vermont,
and other states felt like they were environmental hotspots, and that their
corporations were being hindered, their capacity to trade nationally and
internationally was being diminished. </p>
<p>The U.S. finally
started an open test of milk for radioactivity in 1957, twelve years after the
explosions began. And Linus Pauling, who won the Nobel Prize for his work on
nutrition, particularly related to vitamin C, came out with his conclusion that
the body really discriminates against strontium and favors calcium uptake if
the calcium levels were high enough. That prompted the addition of the calcium,
as I was saying, to milk, bread, and animal feeds, as well as fertilizers. So
this is quite curious. The Surgeon General for the U.S. denied that the fallout
hazards were serious in the New York Times in 1959. </p>
<p>So there was really
quite an open public debate in the late '50s, in part that surrounded
Eisenhower's campaign to become president again in 1956. And his competitor was
his vice president, Adlai Stevenson. So Stevenson basically broke the news that
the Atomic Energy Commission had been hiding this information from the public.
And in his last-minute campaign effort, he claimed that there were genetic
hazards to future generations, risk of bone cancer, and the inability to
conduct medical investigations. Now, this is interesting. So that there is exposure
that is universal, everybody's exposed because everybody eats. That means that
you really don't have any opportunity for a scientific control group that is
unexposed to figure out what the long-term health effects might be. </p>
<p>Thirteen Yale
scientists, including Arthur Galston of the Biology Department, who passed away
just a few years ago, signed a statement endorsing the views of Stevenson.
Stevenson lost, Eisenhower became president again. And what was interesting
about it is that transcripts from his conferences, his national security team,
had been released in the late 1990s as well. And Eisenhower eventually got to
the point where he was telling his staff that the levels of radionuclides in
the milk supply, the buildup especially in children's bones, was unacceptable,
and something was going to have to happen. And that prompted him to be more
aggressive in trying to negotiate with the Soviets to create some sort of a
treaty that would reduce atmospheric testing. </p>
<p>So I'm going to jump
ahead here so I don't run out of time. The Atomic Energy Commission also was
found to have withheld data recognizing that there were these spikes in the New
York cities' milk supplies, data that was collected just prior to the election
that they understood posed a problem. They held that until weeks after the
election. So it's kind of curious that milk became the standard for trying to
figure out where the chemicals went, especially powdered buttermilk, because in
its dehydrated form, it was easy to send around the country. And this chart I
think is also interesting, because remember that the Limited Test Ban Treaty of
1963 really stopped the testing cold. And what you see is a gradual decline in
worldwide fallout, represented by strontium-90 and cesium-137 in milk. So you see
this gradual decline because of the residency time in the atmosphere, so that
these chemicals don't all wash out like quickly after the explosions. They go
into global circulation. And there was great debate at the time about the
amount of time that they stayed in the atmosphere. And the Atomic Energy
Commission was arguing, don't worry about it. They're going to stay in the
atmosphere for a long period of time. Why would they use that logic? Well, they
wanted the radiation to dissipate so that by the time the nuclides got down to
the ground that they wouldn&#39;t pose such an intense radiation threat. </p>
<p>Now, that's kind of
an interesting story. So environmentalists and public health advocates were
arguing, no, you don't understand this pattern of deposition. It's often more
quickly that it reaches the ground concentrated in the higher intensity of
radiation. So that this story played out over the 1970s and 1980s until
gradually, you find 1995 it really leveling off to what it is today. Curiously,
you see the spike in cesium-137 in 1987, 1986, 1987. Anybody have any idea what
that might be?</p>
<p><b>Student: </b>Chernobyl.</p>
<p><b>Professor John Wargo:
</b>Chernobyl.
Chernobyl released more cesium-137 to the atmosphere after the explosion, where
the dome of the building blew off and there was a fire that was uncontainable
for a period of weeks. It spewed more radiation into the atmosphere in the form
of cesium-137 than many of the earlier atmospheric weapons tests did. </p>
<p>So I began by telling
you that under conditions of secrecy, the people that hold power over the
secret have great narrative advantage. They not only control the search for the
data, they control its interpretation and they control the story that's told to
the general public. And a couple of elements of this story are kind of fun to
think about, because we'll see these same narratives evolve for pesticides, for
plastics, for a variety of different environmental problems. Is the problem
human induced or is it more important to worry about natural sources? </p>
<p>Natural sources of
radiation, hmm. So you see these comparisons between the dose that you would
get by having a glass of milk or having the diet of a child, a comparison
between that and number of flights that you would take across the United
States. And you probably know that you get a measurable dose of radiation when
you're up in aircraft. So this comparison between human-induced exposure
compared to natural exposure, another good example of that would be radon. And
in Connecticut, we have a problem with radon gas, which is radioactive, being
emitted especially from the kind of rock that we have here, and particularly
along the coastline heading east down here along the Long Island Sound. And my
basement in my house, for example, we had a radon problem where radon gas was not
just measurable, it was really quite high. So we had to figure out how to
remediate that. You dig a hole in your basement floor, you put a little fan and
a pipe in, and you get rid of it. If you don't do that, then you risk exposing
your family to radon, which is a very well-known carcinogen. The estimates of
deaths from radon exposure in the United States are actually quite high. You
know, 40,000 to 50,000 people per year are believed to get lung cancer as a
result of radon exposure. So that the comparison of natural sources of
radiation to human-induced sources related to national security protection,
there is some legitimacy to that and you have to be very careful about it. </p>
<p>Also, the idea of
relative risk. Well, why are we worrying about radiation when we should be
worrying about other kinds of risks? We'll see that with respect to pesticides,
where you find, say, the car manufacturers concerned about the emission
technology requirements under the Clean Air Act for tailpipe emissions. And
they point to other sources, other critical sources of human exposure to air
pollutants, such as power plants or incinerators. </p>
<p>So this idea of risk
comparison really was well honed in the 1940s and 1950s by the Atomic Energy
Commission. In that case, the concern was to express the risk relative to
misunderstanding the implications of nuclear war and not being able to protect
the public from excessive patterns of exposure. That played out by the way in a
variety of pretty unusual ways so that many people in the 1950s built fallout
shelters in their backyard. My neighbors did it, my family never had the means
to do it. But my neighbors had these concrete buildings that they built
underground. They looked a lot like basements. And they would store water and
food and they would practice air drills, where they would run down into the
basement. And this was especially important during the Cuban Missile Crisis,
where we came the closest that we ever have to nuclear war. So the idea of how
long do you have to stay in the shelter to protect yourself? Well, you wouldn't
know that unless you had done these atmospheric tests and you understood how
the concentrations diminished over a certain period of time. So the idea of
relative risk also deserves merit. </p>
<p>This is also an
interesting time when the first environmentalists had formed their
organizations back in the 1940s and 1950s. They tended to be medical doctors,
the very first environmentalists. And one of the interest groups that you
recognize today is Consumers Union that produces <i>Consumer Reports</i> magazine,
it compares product quality and often environmental or health claims of
products. So Consumers Union was very active in collecting milk, in this case
from forty-eight cities around the world. </p>
<p>No one talked about
human milk, and I found this to be quite fascinating. So for the entire decade
[1945-55], no one spoke about oh, well, if it's getting into cow's milk, why
isn't it getting into human milk? If it's getting into human milk, what's the
capacity to be transferring these radionuclides across generations via breast
feeding? Well in part, I think it was a shyness, a reluctance to talk about
breastfeeding in public, which was common at the time. But it was clearly an
issue that the Atomic Energy Commission had recognized. And I found a document,
it was a document that was declassified that was produced in 1952 that
demonstrated quite clearly that the Atomic Energy Commission had made the
connection like that. It's in cow's milk, it's going to be in human milk. We
know that these compounds are capable of causing mutations in genes and some of
those mutations are inheritable, they can be transferred across generations, in
addition to the fact that we're exposing the next generation via breast milk,
in addition to infant formula in milk and other parts of a small child or an
infant's food supply. Also, the group SANE became famous at this point in time,
a group that was politically active to protect pregnant women. And this history
is the first history in the twentieth century where children's health became a
logic for a stronger set of regulations and rules relative to emitting
something that could be thought of as dangerous to the atmosphere. </p>
<p>So gradually, by the
end of the decade, the Atomic Energy Commission recognized that strontium-90
accumulated in soils, it accumulated in foods, it accumulated in kids. They
knew how to calculate what the cancer risk was because they understood the
dose-response relationship. So they were basically sitting on a gold mine of
knowledge that they had kept from the public as best they could during this
period of time. </p>
<p>So here's a list of
sixty years of experimentation with nuclear weapons, forty-three years,
forty-five years of negotiation. And you see the Antarctic Treaty, the
agreement not to conduct the testing in the Antarctic. This is common heritage
for all of mankind, so to speak. You see the Hotline Agreement. Before a
nuclear war was initiated, there was an agreement to call up the Soviets and
try a last-minute attempt at negotiation. The Limited Test Ban Treaty that I
just described, the Outer Space Treaty, the Seabed Treaty, it's not legal to
conduct experiments in the seabed. So that common property around the world is
now protected by international treaty. </p>
<p>However, the United
States is testing at a rate that has never been less. The testing, however, the
majority of it is underground. And I'll show you a clip next week of some
underground tests that created earthquakes in different parts of the world,
particularly in Alaska. And we also see a very curious effect where these
former testing sites were eventually translated into fish and wildlife
reserves. So that's another interesting thing to try to explain. </p>
<p>And I'm going to
close today with one more thought for you. This entire story unfolded between
1945 and 1963. The Environmental Protection Agency was created in 1970 and the
Safe Drinking Water Act was created in 1976. So there was absolutely no
protection, there was no monitoring of public water supplies through this
entire period of time. The Clean Air Act was not in existence, so that there
was no protection against the radionuclides as air pollutants or air contaminants.
And finally, in 1976, the Environmental Protection Agency set an acceptable
radioactivity limit for drinking water of 1 millisievert, or that can be
translated into 0.1 rem [Rontgen equivalent man] per year. </p>
<p>How about
radionuclides in food? One would think that this history would provide a very
good logic for establishing limits for radionuclides in food. But as the
Chernobyl event in 1986 unfolded, we realized that we were not alone in not
having any sort of limits for radionuclides in food. Neither did any of the
European Union nations, so trade was completely disrupted, tens of billions of
dollars of food was lost following the Chernobyl event because Italy had one
standard for acceptable contamination, whereas Germany had another. All the
nations had different standards. But just keep this in mind, that the United
States still has no maximum permissible limits. </p>
<p>The take-away point
here, simply when secrecy is combined with the absence of environmental and
health surveillance, the public opinion and politics favor the development of
hazardous technologies. In this case, this knowledge was controlled by elites
and then released selectively to an unknowing public in an attempt to encourage
them to favor continued atomic weapons testing. </p>
