<p><b>Professor John Wargo</b>: Today I want to
talk about water and the law that surrounds drinking water, to talk about its
quality, talk about what your rights are to clean water. To also give you a sense
of what key threats are to drinking water, what your exposure might be, and
what we might do about it both legally but also personally. </p>
<p>Water is a critical
component of our environment and our bodies. Your body is close to seventy
percent water. You can go for several weeks, two to three on average, without
food. You can only go for about four minutes without air. And you can go for
maybe four or five days without water before you die. So water is absolutely
critical. And one of the key arguments I want to make today is that it's a
largely neglected area of environmental law, given the rapid increase in our
knowledge about chemical threats to water quality and where those threats come
from. </p>
<p>So what are the major
challenges in water on a global scale? Clearly one is water-borne diseases.
Diarrheal diseases are recognized to kill between four and five million people
per year in Africa. Aquifers that cross property and jurisdictional boundaries
are a critical issue. So many rivers form the boundary between nations or
between states. The Connecticut River is a very good example, separating
Vermont from New Hampshire. </p>
<p>Point source control
versus surface runoff. We've had a long history in the last half of the
twentieth century of trying to control point sources or pipe releases to water
supplies, as opposed to thinking about how chemicals may accumulate on the
surface and then be washed into rivers that are used for drinking water sources
following serious rain events. </p>
<p>Ground water
depletion, the Ogallala Aquifer in the Southwestern part of the United States
and in the western part of Texas, is being rapidly depleted. And its
contamination is well recognized. Aquifers around the nation and most
industrialized countries are now more intensively tested than they had been
before. And it's recognized that they contain chemicals that never were
anticipated to persist or to migrate. </p>
<p>Private wells. The
Safe Drinking Water Act has been established in the United States to require
testing and control the chemical content only in water systems that supply more
than fifteen households, fifteen or more households. So if you grew up perhaps
in a rural part of the nation or you live outside of New Haven, you may have
your own well, as I do. So I have a 600-foot-deep well. And when I purchased my
house, I was quite happy with that prospect, thinking that water on the surface
would need to be filtered down through the soil before it got down into the
well. And it was quite striking, I had quite a lesson from a well driller. My
well went dry one day, I didn't know what happened. So I called the well
driller and he came out and it was a pretty remarkable lesson for me. Within
forty-five minutes, he had pulled up the well head, he had coiled the water,
coiled the pipe, and I recognized that I hadn't paid any attention to the fact
that the casing that surrounds the well could convey water that had been
contaminated on the surface down the side of the casing and into the underlying
water supply. I'll tell you more about the plastics side of that story in a few
weeks. </p>
<p>So wells that service
greater than fifteen households are regulated under the Safe Drinking Water
Act, which means that if a chemical is listed on the EPA's list, then community
supplies have to test for the presence of that chemical. And if a maximum
contaminant level has been set, that means that the provider has to demonstrate
that that ceiling has not been breached, or he or she would have to install
some sort of filtration system. So within Connecticut, by the way, that means
that approximately thirty to forty percent of the Connecticut population is
getting water that is not managed in any way by the Safe Drinking Water Act. </p>
<p>Surface water in the
United States is generally believed now to be undrinkable for a variety of
reasons, mostly because of biological contamination, the threat of E. coli, but
also giardia, which is carried by both humans and by animals in their wastes.
Monitoring and surveillance needs much improvement. I'll talk more about the
monitoring system that is currently in place and why it's deficient. </p>
<p>Public water
infrastructure also is inadequate. How many of you know the way that water
moves from its source to your tap? What kind of equipment does it go through?
What kind of filtration does it go through? What kind of land uses are allowed
in the watershed that surrounds the lakes that provide New Haven's water
supply? And what about the pipes that convey the water to wherever your tap is?
Do you know what they're made out of? Are they plastic? Are they copper? Are
they bronze? Are they metal? Are they leaded? There are many connectors in many
cities that are quite old that are no longer allowed to be installed that
connect the water main itself into your apartment or into your house. But they
exist and remain because it&#39;s extremely expensive to dig up every connector and
replace it with one that does not contain lead. </p>
<p>How about your faucet
itself? What's your faucet made out of? Well, many faucets are made out of
brass. And increasingly, they're made out of plastic, plastic that is painted
to look like it's metal, painted silver. You have to be really careful when you
buy a faucet system or you put in a drinking water supply system to really
think deeply about the source of the materials and their leachability into your
supply. The leachability is driven by a variety of factors. It could be heat.
So for example, you certainly would not want to make a cup of tea by turning
your hot water tap on and then putting a tea bag in the water. Or you want to feed
infant formula to a small child by putting powder, for example, in a glass, and
then filling it up with hot tap water, because the hot tap water is likely to
leach more compounds from the pipe or whatever the conveyance system is than
cold water would. </p>
<p>How long do you wait
to let the water run before you take a drink out of your tap? Makes sense not
to drink water that has been sitting in your tap overnight or you come back
from vacation for a couple weeks. We now recognize that water that sits in
pipes takes up contaminates from the conveyance system. So all of these issues
are worth thinking about in terms of infrastructure. </p>
<p>How about water
rights? Really, what are your rights to clean water? And the core question of
this lecture is really how safe is safe enough? And how do we define safe,
particularly using the language of the Safe Drinking Water Act? And finally,
how does land use affect water supply? So many people are not at all thoughtful
about where watershed boundaries in the vicinity of where they live. They're
not thoughtful about how chemicals can migrate long distances. I worked in
California in the Central Valley near Fresno for a while on a project where
chemicals were recognized to migrate more than five miles from their point of
application to an agricultural field into underlying aquifers. So it depends
very much on the underlying surficial geology, the soil structure, the bedrock,
the groundwater regime, how fast a chemical will move. Some move really quite
quickly, others move really quite slowly if they can bind to organic matter. </p>
<p>So once again, the
Safe Drinking Water Act covers supplies that have more than fourteen
connections or more than twenty-four individuals. There are 53,000 water
systems in the United States, and 43,000 of those rely on groundwater and about
10,000 rely on surface water. And they're roughly split fifty-fifty, public and
private. And there are 15 million wells in the United States that serve
individual residences, and roughly 45 million people, maybe fifteen percent of
the population in the nation are drinking water that is completely unregulated
by the Safe Drinking Water Act. </p>
<p>I wondered about this
and I wondered about what we could find out about well water vulnerability. And
also if a casing surround a well is cracked, that means that chemicals applied
to the surface have a higher chance of migrating down the inside of the casing.
So I asked the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of
Health here in Connecticut if I could get a hold of their database--GIS, Geographic
Information System that they had that identified the location of all wells in
Connecticut, all wells that had been mapped and geo-coded. And then I overlaid
that data with surficial geology. </p>
<p>And then I started
looking at old air photos, wondering about former land uses. And a pattern
started to emerge that in many areas that had been former agricultural lands,
these had been developed into residential areas and wells had been dug into
those areas and provided unregulated water supplies to almost a million people
in the state of Connecticut. It's kind of an interesting story. When I asked
for that database, I was denied access to it. This was post-9/11, because they
were worried about releasing the geo-coded data on precisely where the wells
where. So I had to sign a paper that promised that I would be legally
responsible for securing that data and maintaining its confidentiality and I
would not release it to anybody who could do something nasty to a public water
supply. </p>
<p>So what about
compliance? How are we doing in the area of compliance? Well, 30 million people
drink water each year. A little hiccup there for some reason. Thirty million
people drink water each year from systems that report violations of
health-based standards. There are about ninety-three chemicals that are not now
on the Safe Drinking Water list, that have maximum contaminant levels assigned
to them. So 30 million people, ten percent of the population, drinking water
that the systems have reported are in violation. Ten thousand systems violated
health-based drinking water standards and about eighty percent of the public
water systems have reported no violations. And EPA has issued 86,000 violations
of federal requirements to monitor or to report results. So the overwhelming
number of violations are associated with the failure to monitor and the failure
to report. So if you don't look, if you don't monitor, you can't find a
problem. And if you find a problem and you're a municipal supplier, that's
going to cost a lot of money. You're either going to try to pass that cost back
on to consumers as increased prices per gallon for their water. But certainly,
you're not going to want to--there's commonly a delay in reporting. </p>
<p>So what is an MCLG? A
maximum contaminate level goal? EPA established both the maximum contaminant
level, which is a legally enforceable limit. But they also established a
maximum contaminant level goal, which is a health-based ceiling. So you would
hope that the legal limit would be the same as the health-based limit. But
that's really not the case. So the Safe Drinking Water Act creates the
contaminate level limit as the highest concentration of a contaminant that's
allowed. And it also allows a cost-benefit analysis that's required under the
Safe Drinking Water Act to consider what the cost would be of meeting that
limit. If the cost is found to be excessively high, they'll set a goal that
would be higher to protect human health, and allow a contamination level to be
higher than that. </p>
<p>So here&#39;s a chart
that gets us to really what our present level of regulation is. And you see
that after the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed back in 1976 that no new
standards were enacted. It's been kind of interesting. So Congress basically
gives EPA the mandate to regulate and monitor water supplies, but EPA doesn't
really do very much about it. This period in the 1970s and early 1980s was a
period that EPA was concentrating on source emissions from smokestacks as well
as auto emissions and also a variety of pesticides. But really, it was paying
very little attention to drinking water. So it added seven volatile organic
compounds in 1987, about eleven years later. Copper and lead were not revised
based upon new evidence of their toxicity from data that had been collected
back in the 1970s until 1991. So remember, I argued earlier that there's often
this delay between recognizing that a compound is more hazardous than earlier
thought before the agency would take action and set a new limit. We're seeing
the same thing play out here. </p>
<p>Well, Congress was
upset at this delay and they demanded that a variety of new chemicals be added,
including thirty-nine pesticides, volatile organic compounds, metals. So these
were added in 1991. And then during the period of the 1990s, seven years, there
were no new standards. Well that's kind of interesting, because you might
assume quickly that in a more liberal administration that you'd have more rapid
listing chemicals, you'd have a more protective character. This is not the
case. So that the liberalism or the conservatism of the administration seemed
to have little influence on this rate of adoption. So today we're sitting here
with about ninety-three different chemicals. And just to give you a sense of
how limited coverage and limited the protection level is, think about this.
That among the thirty-nine pesticides that are monitored and have these maximum
contaminant limits, there are approximately 1,000 more that are completely
neglected. Nobody's testing for them, but they're allowed to be used on
agricultural crops. And many of these have not been fully studied to know how
they move through different kinds of ecosystems or different kinds of geologic
systems and what their potential is to contaminate the water supply. </p>
<p>Think also that more
than 800 other chemicals, including industrial chemicals, have been detected in
water supplies by the U.S. Geological Service. And by the way, the U.S.
Geological Service is playing a really unusual role in this regulatory process
in that they sit within the Department of the Interior. They're completely
unrelated to the Environmental Protection Agency. But they're playing a more
vigilant role in monitoring chemical content and hazards in underlying
aquifers, as well as surface waters, than the Environmental Protection Agency
had during this period of time. </p>
<p>So this is a history
of neglect, of limited surveillance, and it's being driven by one fundamental
characteristic of this statute. This is a listing statute, which means that
every time a new chemical is discovered and EPA decides they hope to either set
a goal or to set a limit, they're going to get a fight from all the municipal
suppliers or the private suppliers because the testing costs are going to be
passed on to them. And these testing costs are often not minor. </p>
<p>By the way, it's
interesting to think about what the effect might be of establishing a new
chemical limit. Well, it may mean that you need to conduct a brand new type of
test. It may also mean that you need to install filtration equipment, perhaps
activated carbon filtration, which is extraordinarily expensive. And the
smaller the water system is, the more expense it's going to allocate per
individual household. So if New York City, for example, is facing a new
standard that EPA has adopted, they can pass the cost of monitoring and
filtration on to a very broad group of people. But if you have a much smaller
community, say in the rural west of a couple hundred people in an isolated
area, that's going to be much more difficult for them to comply. </p>
<p>So there's been a
trend towards source protection instead of consumer protection. And in part,
you can see this happening, what the public response to this has been, which is
to rely increasingly on bottled water. And many people have the perception that
bottled water is much safer than tap water is. Well, it's not at all clear that
that is the case. Many people do not understand the filtration techniques of
bottled water companies. We don't really have clear standards. And also, many
of the companies that are marketing heavily in the United States are now
foreign companies. So the public's perception of safety is really poorly
founded in scientific evidence. </p>
<p>Also, there's a story
about plastic. What about the potential of plastic ingredients to migrate into
water supplies? I'll give you one example. About fifteen years ago, I had
bottled water in my house as we were putting in a new water supply system. And
so the bottled water came in a jug that was polycarbonate, a five-gallon jug.
You probably have all seen these, that you'd flip upside down. And I had left
that bottle outdoors, actually had been away for the weekend, it was delivered
on a Friday during the summer months. And the temperature had gone up to about
102. And it was sitting on my driveway in the sun when the ambient temperature
was 102. So it was really baking. So when I opened the bottle and put it on the
stand, I found that it had a really very acrid taste to it, a bitter, acrid
taste. So I called the water company and I asked the bottling company what
might that be? And the response was, &quot;Oh, we'll have a new shipment out to
you right away. It was probably just the cleaning agent or the disinfecting
agent that we put the bottles through.&quot; Well, I studied the problem more
intensely and found that they were using a disinfectant that was actually a
registered pesticide. And also this was perfectly allowable because it makes
sense to try to disinfect water bottles that are coming back that may have had
stagnant water within them. But somehow, the rinsing process hadn't effectively
removed the cleaning agent. </p>
<p>Well, the bottled
water problem goes on in that I looked more carefully at the potential of
plastics to migrate from the polycarbonate into water. And heat, solvents such
as some biocides are mixed with, also cracks in the bottles themselves can
cause the chemicals to migrate more frequently. The offending chemical in this
case is bisphenol A, and we'll talk more about that later. If you look across
the maximum contaminant limits and you compare them to the public health goal,
this study by the state of California found that the maximum contaminant limit,
the allowable concentration, was often two, four, even sixteen times higher
than the health goal, which tells us that in many cases the agency is making a
determination that we can be exposed at a limit that they believe is not health
protective. There are other studies that have demonstrated a similar finding
for other chemicals besides the elements. </p>
<p>So one of the ways to
think about the effectiveness of any statute is to think carefully about how
it's monitored. So what sampling design should be created in order to figure
out whether or not we're effectively searching for chemicals that pose the
greatest threat? Well, I asked this question of the New Haven Water Authority
and found to my surprise that systems of twenty-five to a thousand people are
only required to provide one sample per month. And it's pretty clear that there
are certain climatological events, like very serious rain storms, that can wash
contaminants off of surfaces, whether it's an agricultural field or say a large
shopping center parking lot, into surrounding water supplies if they are
nearby. So thinking about the importance of the sampling period is really critical.
And if recent reports have demonstrated compliance with certain standards, then
EPA allows the testing to be limited to only four times per year. And for some
types of systems, such as New Haven Water Company, they have not found certain
pesticides, so they're allowed to monitor only on an annual basis. They can
appeal to the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce the periodicity of
their sampling. And this of course is very important to them, because it saves
them a lot of money. </p>
<p>Trizine herbicides
provide a really good example of this in the Midwest. So trizine herbicides,
they're known as pre-emergent herbicides. And they're commonly sprayed on
fields such as cornfields. And they're sprayed during the spring. And the spring
in the midwestern part of the United States is kind of famous for the intensity
of its rainstorms. So the sampling design relative to the rain events really
proved to be extremely important to the findings. You can pay more attention to
the slide online, but these data demonstrate the ways that increasing the
stringency of standards passes costs on to water supply companies and to people
that are served in really an inequitable way that is dependent upon the size of
the public water system. </p>
<p>So I want to
concentrate today and tell you a story about this chemical. This is a trizine
herbicide and now it's about twenty-seven-year-old story. But atrazine has
become infamous as one of the most heavily used herbicides in the world. Its
uses in the United States include food crops: field corn, sweet corn, sugar
cane, sorghum, winter wheat, guava, macadamia nuts. It's used also on nonfood
crops, such as hay, pasturelands. It's also used in forestry. It's also used in
residential and industrial and recreational areas. On residential turf, within
parks and on institutional turf. Also on golf courses. And it's used for
landscape maintenance. And the whole idea behind an herbicide is to kill other
species of plants so that they don&#39;t rob nutrients away from the desired or
highly valued plant. </p>
<p>So it's also sprayed
on roadways. And this is an interesting idea. It would be a great student
project. Think about the number of miles of roadways in the United States that
are treated with herbicides. My town is a good example, little town of Killingworth.
They don't like to cut the vegetation next to the guardrails. So what do they
do instead? They come along with a truck and they just spray the side of the
road. Next time you get on Amtrak, take a look at the vegetation that goes
along the track, and you'll see almost nothing. You'll see it devoid of
vegetation. How do they do that? Is it just that they didn't plant anything?
No. Because seeds would blow into the area and they would grow unless chemicals
were applied. So along major highways in the United States, along state
highways in many communities in areas that have guardrails, along corridors
that are used for power lines or rail on the runways of many airports,
pesticides are applied. So if you count up the total area in the nation where
these herbicides are applied, you can quickly get up to hundreds of millions of
acres of the landscape. It's really quite striking. So, you know, finding a
chemical such as this in the water supply really should not be that much of a
surprise. But no one has really looked systematically at where concentrations
of applications are going on. </p>
<p>But I'll give you one
example of where you might conduct this kind of a study. And that's with golf
courses. So that about $225 million per year in the United States are spent on
chemical treatments of golf courses. There is almost no landscape that I could
imagine, including agricultural lands, that are treated more intensely than
golf courses, and particularly putting surfaces. So about $1,300 per acre of
35,000 acres of putting surfaces are receiving quite a variety of different
biocidal compounds. </p>
<p>As a nation, we need
to think about where are we applying chemicals the most. And we're doing it
predominantly to field crops: field corn--about 59 million acres of field corn
is treated, sorghum, sugar cane, sweet corn--in both processed and fresh form.
So large percentages of these crops are treated with atrazine. So if you map
out the concentration of atrazine in streams in the United States, you see it
centered on the Midwestern part of the country, and this is the primary
corn-growing region. So what you find is concentrations in the microgram per
liter level, which is a part per billion level. And the maximum concentration
level, the MCL for atrazine is, I believe it's three or point three. Excuse me,
parts per billion. And if you look across the nation to the number of people
now that the Environmental Protection Agency think are drinking residues of
this chemical in the water supply, you see this adds up to millions of people.
So large circles, like the one around Texas, represent more than 8 million
people. Circles around Florida represent about 4 million people. So you see
that they're finding it in the water where it's most heavily used for
agricultural purposes. </p>
<p>So this was first
registered in 1958. And by registered I mean it was given a license, it's like
a driver's license. So atrazine, it's regulated under the Safe Drinking Water
Act, it's regulated under the Clean Water Act as well, and EPA began a Special
Review that reserve for chemicals that they have particular concerns about in
1994. </p>
<p>Now Special Review
has had a rather infamous history inside EPA. And I have a good friend who
graduated from Yale who has worked her way up to a high level inside the
agency. And she refers to EPA's parking lot. And the parking lot is a place
where EPA stores chemicals, not literally, but figuratively, when it decides
it's not going to take any regulatory action on them. So atrazine was put in
the parking lot, so to speak, receiving little attention for much of the 1980s,
when these data came out, when people realized that the concentrations were
going up. When the parking lot fills up with additional chemicals, it basically
means that the chemicals take longer and longer to receive review, and you have
a lower and lower probability that health-based standards are going to be set
in response to new evidence of serious contamination or risk. </p>
<p>Another problem with
atrazine is that it's structurally so similar to other kinds of herbicides,
including simazine and propazine. And it produces similar chlorinated
metabolites. Metabolites are byproducts that the compound, the original
compound, breaks into. That it makes sense to think about how we might be
exposed to clusters of these compounds, instead of treating them individually.
So remember my argument earlier that EPA's attention is focused chemical at a
time. So they'll make a decision on atrazine without thinking about simazine or
propazine. But in terms of your exposure, in terms of its behavior inside your
body, there is a presumption that chemicals that are so similar in structure
will behave similarly in your body and pose a similar threat. So as a society,
we want the government to pay attention to these mixtures, particularly if there's
a plausible reason that we might be exposed to the mixtures. </p>
<p>So in 1991, the MCL
was set at three parts per billion. And the MCLG was set at three parts per
billion as well. And the compliance was determined based upon a running annual
average, with quarterly samples required by EPA or a single average sample.
Also in the late 1980s, this was classified as a possible human carcinogen. But
then the Environmental Protection Agency reviewed it as not a likely human
carcinogen. Now, how do they make these choices? Well, they submit evidence to
what they call a scientific advisory panel. And I've had the experience of
sitting on EPA scientific advisory panels for nearly a decade and reviewing new
evidence of risk. And the decision on the part of the panel to recommend a
classification as a carcinogen or not a carcinogen or a chemical of high
concern or low concern, it really depends very much upon who is asked to sit on
the scientific advisory panel. And I want to recommend to you the work of a
professor at Harvard, Sheila Jasanoff. Sheila came here as a visiting professor
for a while. And her work has been very important on what she calls the fifth
branch of government, which are these advisory panels. </p>
<p>So evidence is often
so complex that an agency is not really clear what they're going to do. Is the
risk higher? Is it lower? Should we regulate? Should we just warn people? How
are we going to manage this chemical? They'll submit this question to a
scientific advisory panel to gain their advice. Well, the political makeup of
these panels makes a terrific difference in guiding the ultimate outcome. So
the Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, EPA, most regulatory agencies rely very heavily on these
scientific advisory panels. But just because a scientific advisory panel makes
a recommendation, doesn't mean that you ought to believe it. Prior regulation,
they looked at the chemical more intensely and they found that prior regulation
was insufficient. So that they deleted rangeland millet in pineapple uses. So
instead of prohibiting the chemical outright, they would look at the particular
uses, probably uses that did not have a very high economic value, and decided
to go after those to prohibit or further restrict those. They also used what
they called a restricted-use classification. </p>
<p>And pesticide law,
FIFRA, the acronym Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, it has
this restricted-use classification. And this is an interesting idea. I was
telling a section last night that it's similar to the idea of a pharmacist. In
other words, in the world of pharmaceuticals, we had this intervening layer of
expertise so that the pharmacist plays a role of interpreting exactly what the
appropriate dose is for you. So the physician doesn't give you the drug
directly normally. Although this happens in a hospital often. But in a
pharmacy, you get access to a chemical that poses certain risks because experts
are there behind the counter to make sure that you're getting the proper dose
and that you understand that there could be drug interactions or that there may
be certain side effects that you should be aware of. </p>
<p>So this same concept
was built into pesticide law, but in a very different way of training licensed
applicators. So if a chemical is classified as being restricted use because it
is more toxic or it's more persistent or it poses a certain kind of a health
threat, then someone has to be trained before they're allowed legally to apply
it. And within the pesticide regulations there is a provision so that supposing
I went and I got my license. So I was licensed to apply dangerous pesticides,
particularly in, say, restricted areas that were ecologically vulnerable or
maybe inside schools or hospitals. So that I have the legal authority to
delegate that responsibility to you. And if you have no training at all, makes
no difference. And I would tell you what to do, I would tell you to follow the
label directions very carefully. </p>
<p>But remember what I
was saying about literacy and background literacy. So how do you mix say a
quarter ounce of a toxic substance in, say water or in kerosene or some other
solvent that it's supposed to be sprayed in? And how do you know that you've
got exactly the right concentration? Well, it takes some mathematical skill to
do that. And I've run across a couple of cases that I was describing last
evening where people that were delegated this authority not only had a minimum
level of literacy, but also had virtually no mathematical capacity to make these
kinds of judgments. </p>
<p>So EPA realized this
eventually and they started requiring containers that were in a sense
foolproof, so that you would tip it, they call it a tip-and-pour mechanism. So
you could pour out only the correct proportion of the active ingredient. And
then all you had to figure out was whether or not you had to add one or two
gallons to it. So this reduced the error rate. But if you are spraying a
pesticide, as an example, and you've got a backpack on and you've got a spray
wand, I mean, I could be spraying the edge of this podium and walking along. My
cell phone could ring. I could stop. I could look at my watch, and then I could
move on. And the effect would be what? Well, when I looked at my watch,
wherever the wand was pointing, it would get a dose that probably would be
dozens of times higher than if I were walking in a uniform way. </p>
<p>There's kind of an
interesting analog to that with respect to spray planes or tractors. So you can
imagine a tractor that has a bar across the back end with holes on it, such as
it's going to irrigate a field. Well, the truck goes along, gets to the end of
the field. It turns around, comes back this way. And eventually, it covers the
entire field. Well, if it has the same application rate, the same emission rate
from the pipe regardless of the speed of the truck, where in the field are you
going to get the higher concentrations? At the ends of the field, where the
truck slows to turn around. </p>
<p>Similarly, if you can
think about spray plane coming in and spraying the hypothetical field, which is
the platform up here. They pass this way, then they come back and they pass
another way. I've seen farm workers in California standing there with just
shorts and a straw hat on kind of waving as a marker for the spray plane, being
sprayed repeatedly. There's an occupational side to pesticide control that I
don't have time to express to you. But then you get this overlap of the spray
in the field. </p>
<p>So these kinds of
practical conditions have a really important implication for how you set up
your sampling design. So if you sampled in the middle of the field that was
treated by the truck, or the tractor, you're going to get a lower level of
concentration than if you sampled at the end of the field. The same may be the
case with respect to spray planes and the way that they spray fields. </p>
<p>So the dance of
regulation is one where the government will say, &quot;Look, we've got to cut
back your use, we have to protect the water or we want to reduce worker
exposure.&quot; And the industry that manufactures it will say, &quot;Well, you
know what? Don't cut back in this area, cut back and restrict its use on a
specific commodity,&quot; probably one that is not an economically productive
one for them, or particular kind of use. So the argument about what uses are
restricted as opposed to which ones are prohibited gets quite technical quite
quickly. </p>
<p>So if a chemical
comes back as a recognized, serious threat to human health, that doesn't mean
it's going to be prohibited. Prohibition is very unlikely. I mean, there have
been so few bans in environmental history, probably fewer than 300 bans,
outright bans of chemicals. I've talked to you about a couple of them, DDT is a
good example. And aldrin and chlordane, these are all pesticides. But for the
vast majority of compounds, instead, you get this minor revision in the way the
chemical is allowed to be mixed or applied, it's put into the restricted-use
category. It's allowed to be used on corn but not on other crops, so that the
market share can be maintained. </p>
<p>Here's a graph of the
seasonal pulse of atrazine in water supplies that was recognized in the
Midwestern part of the United States. You can't see the years here, but this is
1995, 1996, 1997, 1998. And you see this pulse. Because they apply it in the spring
and then the rains will wash it into the surrounding water supplies. Well, so
another sampling design issue here that really is critical to the effectiveness
of the statute is that if you decided that you were going to sample say in
September of each year, you're going to miss this pulse. So it's only by
sitting down and thinking about the method of application, the timing of the
application, and thinking about it in a more systems or ecological manner that
considers climate, that you would be able to pick this up. </p>
<p>There was a very
legal debate as well about what this chemical is doing, where it's moving. And
the U.S. Geological Service found that it travels actually hundreds of miles
from its site of application. So it's running off the fields, it's getting into
streams, and it's getting into rivers, such as the Mississippi River, and it's
moving long distances. So this study found that some states were receiving
fifty percent of their pollution load from out of state. So if atrazine is
reaching say, Louisiana but we know that it's not applied in Louisiana, what
right do they have to sue the Environmental Protection Agency for the failure
to regulate that chemical's application up in Ohio or Illinois or in Minnesota?
And they do have the authority to sue the Environmental Protection Agency or
particular chemical companies that are responsible. So this trans-boundary
movement of these chemicals raises a very serious issue. </p>
<p>And also, you've got
to think about the fact that many of these cities get their water supplies from
these rivers. And they use filtration systems that do not have the capacity to
extract many of the pesticides that are used. So water is typically filtered by
running it through sand to take out particulate matter. Then it's treated with
chlorine. It's not normally treated with activated carbon, which could bind to
these chemicals. Now, that should ring bells in your head if you're concerned
about your own water intake, because water is the most consumed food in your
diet. It should ring a bell that you should be concerned about the quality of
water in your tap and you should think carefully about the wisdom of using
activated carbon at the tap, because it's not likely that the government has
kept it perfectly safe. </p>
<p>So I'm going to scoot
ahead here with one final aspect of this story. The atmospheric transport of
some of these chemicals was a surprise to many, inside the agency as well as
the scientific community. I ran into this in California, when I found that a
chemical, dibromochloropropane, that had been injected into the soil in cotton
fields, had actually volatilized and gotten up into the fog. </p>
<p>Anybody here from the
Central Valley? Well, the Central Valley of California, which is sandwiched
between the coastal range and then the Sierras, is a flat basin, it's a former
lakebed. And climatologically, it's interesting because a fog will settle on
that area and stay there for a good part of January, sometimes December, six to
eight weeks. So what they found was DBCP was actually volatilizing and it was
detectable in the fog. They found toxaphene that had been applied in Texas in
the Great Lakes. Then they found atrazine in the Great Lakes as well. So point
six percent of atrazine is deposited, in one study, in rainfall. And the
concentration of atrazine in precipitation in some areas where it had not been
applied, was one part per billion. And what did I tell you the maximum
contaminant level was? Three parts per billion. Fairly striking. So it's moving
long distances in clouds and raining down and perhaps acting as a pre-emergent
herbicide to areas where it was never intended to be used. </p>
<p>So the degradation of
the chemical in aquatic environments is increasingly of concern. The half-life
is between forty-one and 237 days. An average half-life of the chemical of 159
days. And Lake Michigan is a repository for atrazine because of its use,
particularly in Minnesota and Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, and the pattern of
rainfall in that area. So it's cold water, it's low productivity, it's high pH,
low nitrate, and low dissolved oxygen, all contribute to increased persistence
of the chemical. So the estimated half-life in Lake Michigan is about
thirty-one years. </p>
<p>So EPA conducted a
study that found that when they tried to figure out what the mass balance was
of atrazine or is of atrazine. So atmospheric wet deposition is about 2,493
kilograms per year. The watershed loading directly and surface water runoff to
the lake is about 5,000 kilograms per year. 2,500 kilograms exported to Lake
Huron and exported to Chicago by water diversions, a more minor amount. And
even the lake itself is volatilizing the chemical. So recognizing that the
agricultural practice of using atrazine as an herbicide and EPA's neglect of
this compound and misunderstanding of its ecological behavior could cause a
gradual buildup to 182,000 kilograms of the compound sitting in the lake. It
was really quite striking. </p>
<p>So I'm going to just
pause with reflections on the work of Tyrone Hayes, who is a former chemical
company employee, a scientist who worked for Syngenta. And Tyrone Hayes has
been responsible for some controversial work. So he took his students and he
rented a tractor-trailer. And they drove across the country, taking a look at
the concentrations of atrazine in leopard frogs. And what was interesting about
his finding, because he sampled from areas of the country where the leopard
frogs lived but atrazine was not used. And then he went into the heart of the
Midwestern atrazine-use belt and sampled in those areas. And he found obviously
higher concentrations in the areas where it was used, but he also found that
these frogs had both ovaries and testes. So his argument that this chemical is
hormonally active, at least in the African clawed frog. </p>
<p>And he also is
claiming that there are important lessons here for humans, that this compound
could be also hormonally active in humans. &quot;So atrazine (he argues) in
exposed males that have ovaries in their testes also had much smaller
larynxes.&quot; And larynxes are important if you're a frog, because it's a way
that you can understand where other frogs are or other frogs can understand
where you are for reproductive success. And it's also recognized to lower the
testosterone levels in frogs. </p>
<p>So I'm not going to
go further today, other than to suggest that there's a whole emerging area of
concern now about hormonally active compounds. And atrazine is a good compound
to pay attention to. </p>
<p>Okay, that's it for
today. Thank you very much.</p>
