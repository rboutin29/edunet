<p><b>Professor John Wargo</b>: Today I want to
talk about the relationship between risk and law. And I want to do this in the
context of the history of agriculture and regulating pesticides during the
twentieth century. And also I want to have you consider the idea of risk. </p>
<p>And I'm reminded as I
think about this of T.S. Eliot's line, &quot;Only those who will risk going too
far can possibly find out how far one can go.&quot; So many believe that
environmentalists are in the business of trying to absolutely minimize risk as
opposed to balance the threat of loss or danger against other opportunities.
And others argue that without risk in life, things would be pretty boring. </p>
<p>I was traveling
through Europe last summer on a lecture tour, and I saw this village sitting on
the top of a cliff. And I wondered to myself about the village, and I wondered
how they chose to build so close to the edge, and what kind of thinking was in
their minds. And I could imagine that this used to be a number of fields where
they grazed cattle and sheep, and they probably worried about losing cattle and
sheep across the cliff. Then as it grew into a little village, I can imagine
them worried about their children playing near the edge. </p>
<p>So much of
environmental law is about thinking about the buffer zone or the safety factor
that you would want to use to offer sufficient protection against significant
damage. So the idea of risk and understanding risk is really a fundamental
aspect of human logic and instinct. Within law, it tends to become defined as
probability of loss, probability of damage. It might be an endangered species,
it might be air quality, it could be human health. And it's often expressed in
both quantitative and qualitative terms. So particularly over the past thirty
years, the field of quantitative risk assessment has grown in importance to try
to understand what happens to chemicals or to species, what kinds of pathways
they travel, what kinds of problems might occur from chemical release and
chemical movement. And increasingly, it's more sophisticated mathematically,
and more difficult to understand the different sources of uncertainty that are
embedded in these estimates of risk. You may have heard of the idea of an acceptable
risk level for cancer or some other undesirable outcome as being one in a
million. Well, the government has used that standard on many occasions: a &quot;one-in-a-million
excess risk.&quot; </p>
<p>Well, to put that
into perspective, you might think about the H1N1 infection. So what was the
actual morbidity rate over the past year for H1N1? Well, it turns out that you
would first think about the number of people in the United States, say roughly
300 million people. And you'd want to know what the incidence rate was in the
illness. And those now, I was looking at them last night on the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention website. Their estimate is that between 30 and
45 or 50 million people carried the virus and had some adverse effect from it.
And then I was looking at the statistics for mortality. And between 15 and
20,000 people were killed by the illness. Why the uncertainty associated with
the estimate? Well, it's an illness that can harvest, so to speak, in
epidemiological terms, the more susceptible, those that have serious background
illnesses. </p>
<p>So the expression of
risk for morbidity, which means illness, would be roughly let's say 30 million
out of 300 million, which is really quite striking. There are few illnesses
that have that rate. So roughly a one-in-ten risk. And I mentioned when I
started this brief aside that a one-in-a-million risk is often thought of as
acceptable. </p>
<p>The distinction
between environmental risks that are not biologically based or generated by
pathogens like H1N1 and chemical risks is often that there was a clear causal
relationship between exposure and an understanding of the source of the
illness, and also what might be done to manage it more effectively, such as the
vaccine. By the way, the vaccine that was produced and distributed this year
was really pretty remarkable. It was extremely effective, and the incidence
rate was projected to be far higher than it actually turned out. </p>
<p>So this concern over
quantitative risk assessment, try and understand who's most vulnerable, who's
going to basically sustain the most serious effects, this preoccupies the
Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration when they're
thinking about allowing a new drug to be added to the marketplace. And really,
the decision is all about balancing, trying to think through what the quality
of the evidence is and should the dangers be balanced against the benefits. And
this standard for balancing has shifted dramatically over the twentieth
century. So that the lecture today really will trace the evolution of law and
demonstrate how it's shifted from 1906 to the present. </p>
<p>And I want you to
think about how it really reflects changing science as well as changing human
values. So that as the science gets stronger, we understand the relationship
between an exposure and an adverse outcome and oftentimes, the government will
intervene by setting a new law or a new regulation. So that back in 1906, the
Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was passed after Upton Sinclair published <i>The
Jungle</i>, that described filthy slaughtering conditions in Chicago. The Pure
Food and Drug Act was passed in 1906 as well, and it forbade foreign and
interstate commerce and adulterated or fraudulently labeled food and drugs. So
products could now be seized and condemned, and offending persons could be
fined or jailed, and fresh, canned, or frozen food shipped in interstate
commerce must be pure and wholesome. That was the new standard back in 1906. </p>
<p>So basically, the
idea of adulteration and the idea of fraudulent labeling became important. So
the very first attempts to try to control risk in society related to food and
agriculture really concentrated on the idea of labeling, the idea of making
sure that the product inside the package was what it claimed to be and that it
had an effectiveness that was also claimed, and that it wasn't excessively
dangerous. They really worried about farmers buying pesticides, disposing
pesticides, and then basically having the container filled with sugar or flour.
How would they know the difference? There were many cases of fraudulent
manufacturing practices early in the twentieth century, before this law was put
into place. </p>
<p>Another critical
statute that built on this was the Insecticide Act of 1910 that similarly
prohibited fraudulently labeled pesticides and set standards for purity. So the
idea of ingredient labeling was added to the Insecticide Act. And it was
designed to protect farmers from dangerous and impotent pesticides. If you jump
forward, you find that the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 is
important. And it became the home for pesticide regulation for many years until
EPA took over that responsibility in 1970. And the Food and Drug Administration
was authorized to set, in 1938, limits for chemicals in food. So the recognition
that if you sprayed a field of corn and you harvested the corn and then you
sold it in the supermarket that it might still carry residues, this was
beginning to be well recognized back in the 1930s. </p>
<p>The criteria used to
set the tolerances was really quite interesting at that time. It wasn't a
health-based criterion. It wasn't an environmentally-based criterion. It was
how much residue should be allowed to remain on the food product if the
chemical is sprayed in the field at a dose that's effective to get the job
done, in other words, to kill the pest? So that's kind of interesting. So it
was really a standard that was set to make sure that the residues would not
cause the food to be pulled out of the marketplace because they were
adulterated. So they were really designed to protect the farmer and the
economic value of the crop, rather than the health of the population or the
environmental quality. </p>
<p>The Miller Amendment
of 1954 required tolerances for all pesticides if they might remain as food
residues. And then the Delaney Amendment in 1958 became infamous, because it
set a zero risk standard, a tolerance for carcinogens in food. So the exact
language is that if a pesticide or other food additive is carcinogenic in
laboratory animals or in humans, and that was the first time in law that using
evidence from laboratory animals was considered to be sufficient in order to
ban the use of a chemical. Then it could not be used in a way that would cause
the residue to be present in the food supply. Now, you can imagine that these
chemicals were applied to many different crops. And I mentioned to you that DDT
in my last lecture was applied so heavily to so many different foods, 300
different food crops had tolerances by the mid-1950s. </p>
<p>But the government's
ability to detect these chemicals is really important to this story. So if you
use insensitive detection technology, in other words, supposing that your
chemical detection equipment is only capable of finding residues at the part
per 100,000 level, ten to the minus fifth, or even part per million level. And
the chemical is there, but it's there at the high part per billion level, the
chemical test is going to come back negative, it's going to come back as a
non-detect. So gradually, you see this very interesting evolution in the
concept of purity and what constitutes a safe and pure environment that&#39;s very
much driven by the sensitivity of the detection equipment. So during the
century as the detection equipment became more and more sensitive. Now for some
dioxins, we can detect those down to the part per quadrillion level. And many
chemicals are present in food at the part per trillion level. It's got people
thinking about well, what does that mean? What does that mean to their
potential to influence human health? </p>
<p>So back in the '40s
and '50s, the detection technology was really quite limited, and also the
sampling was quite limited, so that they really weren't sampling that many
foods. You can imagine the scale of the problem this presents today, given the
international character of our food supply. I ask this question with respect
to several commodities, first I started with apples and wondered how many times
the government tested apples for pesticides. And then I looked at bananas. And
for bananas, for a chemical that was, when I looked about eight years ago, one
of the most heavily used insecticides on bananas grown in the tropics, the
government was looking at about fifteen to eighteen samples of bananas for this
compound when I then was able to calculate that several trillion individual
bananas had been imported into the nation during that year. So one needs to
think about what standards are in place in different parts of the world, where
that food is likely to go, keeping records of import statistics, and then think
about what kind of a sampling design would be necessary in order to find these
residues in a way that might eventually lead to health protection. </p>
<p>So the Delaney
Amendment was really quite striking. It was adopted really with great support
in Congress, in part because of the U.S. fascination with cancer and also
cancer management. So this grew in part because of the nuclear weapons testing
era, but it is curious that within the European nations, the regulatory
approach to environmental quality has not been as concerned with cancer, it's
been more concerned with neurological decline and also reproductive health. So
it raises really interesting questions about why the preoccupation in the
United States with cancer. So the first seriously health protective statute
that we can find in environmental law has to do with food and it has to do with
pesticides, and it's contained in this Delaney Amendment. By the way, this
amendment applies to all food additives. And a food additive could be defined
also as a coloring agent, like the salmon coloring I spoke of. It could be
defined as a packaging material migrant. It could be a flavoring agent as well,
so that the standard is very clear. If it induces cancer in animals or in
humans, then it is not allowed. </p>
<p>Curiously, there is a
clause within the statute that applies only to pesticides that are defined as
food additives if they concentrate. And you remember the story I told you the
other day about taking a grape and extracting all the water out of it, or
taking corn and extracting the oil out of it, and having to be thoughtful about
what that really might mean for chemical residues. So if you are concerned
about oil extraction, you need to think about lipophilicity. So if you've got a
chemical such as a chlorinated carbon that is likely to bind onto fats of one
form or another, extracting the oil out will likely also concentrate the
chemical residue. </p>
<p>So if you look in the
code of federal regulations, it's very curious. You can go over to the law
library and pull out the code of federal regulations on pesticides. Actually,
it would be a good assignment for teaching fellows to disseminate. Go look at
the code of federal regulations for pesticide residues in food, and you'll see
40 CFR, 135. And you go to the appendix, and the appendix is several hundred
pages long of individual pesticide-food combinations. So I was quite struck by
his several years ago. And I added all of these up and it turns out that there
are about 10,000 different pesticide-food combinations. </p>
<p>And if you look
carefully at these combinations that set limits for benomyl in bananas or let's
say chlorpyriphos in apples or DDT in milk, that standard is still in place by
the way. It's kind of interesting, even though DDT was banned, as I said the
other day, in the 1970s. But if you look carefully, you'll see that you get a
different residue limit allowed for fresh corn or fresh apples or fresh
soybeans than you do for the processed product. And it's basically because of
this concentration factor. So water extraction, making raisins out of grapes,
making wine out of grapes, or making oils out of different kinds of grains can
have this effect. </p>
<p>The Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of 1947 was the central statute
that was passed, and it really set the stage for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's authority to issues licenses or registrations. So as I mentioned
earlier, the idea of registering a pesticide or allowing it to be used for a
certain crop, these registrations were given out one after another after
another, decade after decade, so that by 1960, there were 50,000 different
pesticide registrations that had been issued. And by 1970, there were nearly
70,000 pesticide registrations. And a registration is given for a specific
chemical use, and it may be also assigned for a specific package. So you may
have chemical X, and that has one registration. And then it may be sold also
with chemical Y or chemical Y and Z, and they would have different
registrations assigned them. And they might have different registrations
assigned for different kinds of uses, so that these chemicals were not just
used on food commodities. Where else might they be used? </p>
<p>Well, think about it.
Many of the buildings at Yale are sprayed by pesticides indoors. So that type
of use often had to have a separate registration. Sprayed in subways, sprayed
in vehicles, added to materials such as plastics that are components of cars or
that are components of urethanes, for example, that coat the wood here. So that
plastics have carried biocides into our environment in a whole set of ways. And
the government had to keep track of where these chemicals were going, and had
to license each of these distinctive uses. So the FIFRA of 1947 was important
because it defined these chemicals as economic poisons, implying yes, they're
poisonous, but they also carry an economic benefit so that we need to look at
this using a utilitarian balancing standard, so that risk-benefit balancing
became the phrase that guided U.S. Department of Agriculture to crank out these
registrations. It also extended the regulations, not just to insecticides, but
to herbicides and rodenticides. </p>
<p>And right now, in
terms of volume of chemical released in the world, you find the herbicides are
the most heavily type of pesticide. So there are pesticides, there are
insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides designed to kill rats or mice,
slimicides, that are applied to kill slime and algae on the side of nuclear
power plant cooling towers. There are nearly a hundred different chemicals. Any
swimmers in the room? Probably a few, or former swimmers? Well, there are
nearly a hundred different pesticides that have been registered for use in
swimming pools to kill a variety of viruses, bacteria, as well as molds and
other pathogens. If you think about that carefully and you think about the
relative risk that is associated with using those chemicals as opposed to not
using them, it's probably a really good choice, given the illnesses that could
live in that environment. So that this statute was the first to really break
down these different categories of biocides and really assign different
regulatory responsibility. No authority was given to the Department of
Agriculture, however, to remove hazardous chemicals from the marketplace. So that
they always found that the benefits outweighed the risk. There are no instances
that I can point to that the Department of Agriculture either banned a chemical
or found that the risk was too serious. They may have adjusted the allowable
use rates or the type of environment it could be released to or the type of
crop. But no product bans. </p>
<p>And think about this.
The government gave, the Congress gave the Department of Agriculture the
authority to manage this program, to implement the program. Now, is that a good
idea? What's the Department of Agriculture's basic role? Well, it's really to
promote economic production of a variety of different agricultural commodities.
And they really also do not have and have not had much expertise in
environmental science to know what happened to the chemicals once they were
released or to think carefully about the health effects. So the medical
expertise within the Department of Agriculture throughout their period of
jurisdiction, which ended in 1970, when the Environmental Protection Agency was
formed, was a period when they really had very little expertise in
environmental science or in medical science, which is really fundamental to the
way that we're thinking about regulating pesticides today. </p>
<p>The FIFRA amendments
in 1964 came after Rachel Carson's book, <i>Silent Spring</i>, raised the alarm
and caused the population to be quite upset about pesticide residues,
particularly their effect on wildlife, but also growing recognition that these
chemicals could build in the human body. And also the Food and Drug
Administration's admission that they had found pesticides in human breast milk
as early as 1952. The public wasn't warned about this. And basically, if you
find a chemical, regardless of what it is, you find it in another species of
mammal's breast milk, you can presume that it's likely to get into human breast
milk as well. </p>
<p>So Rachel Carson's <i>Silent
Spring</i> turned out to be a real watershed, not just legally for pesticides,
because it really increased the sense of susceptibility to biocides or the
economic poisons, but it really met with quite a bit of resistance in Congress.
Again, this was the end of the nuclear weapons testing era in the atmosphere.
And it was also a period of great unrest in the United States. The origin of
the Civil Rights Movement may be traced to this period. The Civil Rights Act of
1964, recall that. Also, we were getting more deeply embedded in the war in
Vietnam at that point in time. And environmentalism was growing up, creeping up
on the agenda. But it was really quite an interesting period. Congress,
however, was preoccupied. Other than making some minor revisions to the statute
that included adding these words: caution, warning, and hazard, depending upon
the relative toxicity. This didn't really help very much because of public
confusion about what those phrases meant. And the Department of Agriculture's
secretary was given authority finally to remove pesticides from the market
based upon a finding of imminent hazard to public. </p>
<p>Now, EPA was created
in 1970, and it was given the responsibility to manage pesticides and it was
consolidated from other agencies. Some fifteen or sixteen different subunits of
different agencies were pulled together to create EPA back in 1970, including
the Department of Agriculture, that had formerly had the pesticide management
responsibility. So you can imagine entire sub-bureaucracies picking up and
moving their materials to EPA. And the stories from some of the early
administrators about how they did this and what the effect was are really quite
striking. They described that the Department of Agriculture had kept files on
individual chemicals, but they were completely disorganized, often just
handwritten, often with no environmental science data, often no testing of chemical
presence in different commodities that it had been licensed to be used on. And
some chemicals had no data at all. </p>
<p>So EPA was in this
situation of becoming immediately responsible for 70,000 different pesticide
registrations. The public was quite concerned about these residues getting into
their bodies and into the environment and the wildlife effects. So they felt a
lot of heat. Increasingly, environmental laws had these citizen suit
provisions, so EPA was getting sued in the early 1970s, and they got sued on a
variety of compounds, such as DDT and aldrin and dieldrin. And they were forced
to go back and look at the data that they had available, and they found that
they really had very little data to justify many of these registrations. But
the law was set up that forced them to look at this problem a chemical at a
time. So if you've got 70,000 different chemicals, and the law requires that
you look at them one at a time and you've got a staff that doesn't have the
basic data in place, this basically put the regulatory process in deep freeze.
So how would you manage that if you were responsible? </p>
<p>Well, Congress
thought about this, and they allocated more and more money to the Environmental
Protection Agency. And EPA became much more aggressive and starting banning
chemicals. They banned DDT first and then aldrin and then dieldrin, heptachlor
and then chlordane. All of these were the chlorinated hydrocarbons. The FIFRA
amendments of 1975 gave the Secretary of Agriculture authority to be notified
of pending cancellations, which meant that he was given a voice to oppose
cancellations. But the Environmental Protection Agency really became the
stewards for human health and environmental quality so that the Secretary of
Agriculture's voice was diminishing in the 1970s. </p>
<p>Congress also
recognized that EPA's not making much progress on this sea of chemicals, so
they'd better do something about it. They mandated that each chemical had to be
reviewed within a nine-year deadline. Well, EPA was not able to accomplish that,
so the &#39;70s and the &#39;80s and &#39;90s were all great examples of what I call the
rule of twenty, that each chemical might get some attention every twenty years.
But what does that mean? You can think about the fact that new chemicals are
being added to the marketplace, new registrations are being issued, the data
are lousy and EPA is taking twenty years to review a single chemical, that
doesn't make sense. The science is evolving at a lightening pace on where the
chemicals are in the environment or what the health effects are, or what the
effects on different species are. And EPA is like this ship that is frozen,
it's icebound, unable to move with a speed that it really needed to. </p>
<p>Well, this was
recognized by the National Academy of Sciences, in two publications that I had
a chance to work on, one regulating pesticides and food that really critiqued
the Delaney paradox. And a bunch of us thought that the zero risk standard as
it had been interpreted by the Food and Drug Administration really did not make
much sense. FDA had interpreted zero risk to mean a little bit of risk. So <i>de
minimis</i> is the phrase that it used. And <i>de minimis </i>means a trivial
amount of risk. And they define that generally as a one-in-a-million risk
threshold. </p>
<p>So that this was a
curious experience for me, because it was my first exploration of the human
diet and its variability. So I started poring through food intake surveys,
which is the reason that I asked a section on Monday night to keep track of
just one day of your own diet. Think about that, what foods do you eat, as a
way of thinking about how patterns in your diet might lead to predictable
patterns of your exposure to residues that had been allowed by government. </p>
<p>So in this case, we
were looking only at that subset of chemicals that had some evidence of
carcinogenicity. So that these chemicals induced cancer in animals or were
known to induce cancer in humans. And we were thinking particularly about how
cancer risk might add up across the chemicals. So a hundred different chemicals
that are cancer inducing in laboratory experiments, how would you deal with
that issue of risk additivity? Would it be possible that there may be a
negative effect on risk if you had two chemical exposures at the same time? </p>
<p>Well, scientists have
found some cases where that actually occurred, where a lower risk chemical is
able to bind onto a site in a cell and prevent a higher risk chemical from
doing the same thing. In other cases, there's a synergistic relationship, so
that the risk is not just additive, but if you're exposed to chemical A and
then chemical B, you've got a higher risk of getting cancer. So working with a
bunch of specialists in cancer, as well as specialists in residue chemistry and
exposure analysis, we came up with a not too complimentary picture of the way
that EPA had regulated carcinogens in the food and recommended also that they
pay much more attention to the individual diet, that the diet was likely to be
the key route of exposure to a variety of different chemicals. </p>
<p>The second book
flowed from the first by the National Academy of Sciences, called <i>Pesticides
in the Diets of Infants and Children</i>. And this focused on a finding inside
the red book, the finding that there's a lot of variability out there in the
diets that people eat that is quite predictable. So if you're Italian, you're
likely to eat more tomato products. If you're Latino, you're likely to eat more
corn products. If you are an African American from the southern part of the
United States, people generally eat more greens. If you are living in
California, you're going to eat more fresh produce than you would if you live
in the Northeast. Its cost does not go up the way that it does in the
Northeast. So diet varied by season, it varied by region of the country, it varies
by age, and it also varies quite a bit by ethnicity. So if you don't understand
these differences in dietary patterns, you really don&#39;t have much hope of
understanding the variability in the chemical matrix that these individual
diets might convey into your body. </p>
<p>So it also presents a
really kind of an interesting idea that you could use cropping patterns as a
way of predicting which chemicals make their way into certain environments. So
if you were looking at the effect of corn on environmental quality in the
United States, corn production, you would want to know where it is planted.
Predominantly in the Midwestern part of the U.S., ground zero is pretty much
Iowa through Ohio and Pennsylvania. And if you map out the pattern of chemical
use, you'll see that herbicides are applied much more intensely in this area
than in other parts of the nation. And that explains why herbicide residues are
detectable in the water supplies of nearly 30 million people in the United
States and also in human tissues. So that this understanding of dietary
diversity turned out to be extremely important because it had been completely
neglected by environmental law. </p>
<p>And the diversity in
patterns of exposure in environmental law is something that I became curious
about and wondered about whether or not you'd find the same thing relative to
drinking water. Would you find the same issue relative to air quality? Are
there pockets of high exposure out there in the population that could be
predictable that would make environmental law and regulation able to focus in a
way that was more effective? And the answer is yes. </p>
<p>So as we look across
cases over the next couple of weeks, we'll see the same pattern emerging, that
once you understand variability in the diet, in other words, once you focus in
and you look for pockets of high exposure, high consumption of corn or high
consumption of a certain cluster of foods. Or you look at certain populations,
such as athletes, that have a higher respiration rate than non-athletes do,
that because of that higher respiration rate, they're going to absorb more
chemicals that are present in the air. So across a whole array of different
kinds of environmental problems that are managed by law, there's basically,
there had been neglect of this issue of variability. So how do you take a body
of law such as the body that I just described to you for these chemicals, and
transform it to be more sensitive to the reality of these patterns of chemical
use and exposure? </p>
<p>So what I'm painting
here is a picture of what I think of as fractured science and fractured law, so
that the legal authority for pesticides is now broken into three different
bureaus, the Environmental Protection Agency, that is responsible for tolerance
setting, but also toxicity testing. The Food and Drug Administration is
responsible for detecting residues in the food supply. And the Department of
Agriculture is responsible for the enforcement of these statutes in meat and
poultry, and also for the assessment of economic benefits associated with producing
the nation's food supply. So you've got these different agencies with different
legal mandates, and they tend not to talk to one another. So that in Great
Britain, they've created a new food safety organization that is really quite
distinctive as a model. They had the same fractured pattern of bureaucratic
control in Great Britain, and they decided that they would consolidate that.
They'd centralize the authority in one group. And it's very curious, because by
doing that, it has allowed conservative administrations to slow down regulation
and to become less environmentally protected much more quickly than if the
authority is diffused among different agencies. </p>
<p>So this is a very
interesting kind of a problem. The primary authority for tolerance setting was
taken away from the Department of Agriculture, just like the authority for
regulating nuclear power was taken away from the Atomic Energy Commission, so
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was created. So you don't want the producer
and the protector of the public interest to be sitting inside the same
organization, that&#39;s really the key principle. </p>
<p>For those of you that
I haven't stunned to death enough with this lecture so far, if you want to know
more about pesticide science and history in law, I published this book about
ten years ago, and this really details the description of how we discovered
that kids were more exposed to many different pesticides than adults, that was
eventually adopted into the Food Quality Protection Act, passed in 1996. So that
this law was designed to deal with this problem of risk being not equally
distributed in society. And it included a new general safety standard. It did
away with the risk-benefit balancing standard and it said, &quot;Okay, instead,
EPA must make its choices based upon the phrase 'reasonable certainty of no
harm.'&quot; </p>
<p>It's kind of
interesting. If you were given the assignment to include a decision standard in
a statute that was health protective, what would you choose? Would you choose a
balancing standard? Probably not. Would you choose the Delaney clause model,
which is a zero-risk standard? You might. Would you choose a standard such as
this, reasonable certainty of no harm? Well, you can imagine that this was
hammered out politically in Congress with great interest on the part of
chemical companies and also food manufacturers to try to understand what its
implications might be for them. </p>
<p>It also requires a
finding of safety. This had not been part of the law until 1996. So EPA must
now find that chemicals are safe for children. This is really quite new and
striking. And it requires a tenfold additional safety factor to account for
uncertainty in the data that they have as they set their limits. So that this
idea of a buffer zone, if you think the risk is X, then you have to allow X
over what in order to set your standard for exposure? Well, do you want a
tenfold safety factor? Do you want a hundredfold, a thousand fold? Well, the
tradition had been to use a hundredfold safety factor. So if you think that
this is what it is, you account for your absence of knowledge or your
ignorance, by dividing the allowable level by a hundred. And in this case,
Congress said, &quot;That's not good enough. You a have to divide it by an
additional ten to account for the uncertainty about the distributional
patterns.&quot; And also, the issue of some groups being more susceptible to
these chemicals than others. </p>
<p>It also required that
the agency for the first time needed to consider how people might be exposed to
the same chemical, not just from food or different crops, but food, drinking
water, and other kinds of environments. So the same chemical might be sprayed
on fruits and vegetables, and it might get into dairy cattle. But it also might
be sprayed in your apartment building. Or it also might be used as an algaecide
in a swimming pool. So that formerly EPA had just kind of given out licenses as
USDA had to these different allowable uses, and not thought about the fact that
to somebody as they basically walked through their daily life could be exposed
to the same chemical across these environmental compartments, so to speak. So
the idea of aggregate risk is new, and it's an attempt to think about the
complexity of the way that these compounds can move through environments. </p>
<p>The idea of cumulative
risk is also new. That the government had to consider the idea that a group of
chemicals might act the same way in the human body, and the risk might be at
least additive, if not synergistic. So for the first time in 1996, EPA had to
review all of its tolerances to think about cumulative risk. And the pace of
review was also sped up so that all chemicals that it had licensed had to be
reviewed by 2006. That was accomplished, quite remarkably. But the critique I
could give you of the quality of the review is a different matter. And finally,
Congress directed the agency not to give equal attention to every pesticide,
but to come through, or to develop some sort of a strategy to concentrate and
focus on chemicals that it thought would be the most risky. </p>
<p>So how would you do
that? How would you define the most risky chemicals? Well, you'd try to find
those that had the highest dose-response rate. In other words, they seemed like
they were the most potent, or the most toxic. But you'd also probably want to
concentrate on chemicals that were persistent, chemicals that got into
different environmental compartments, or chemicals that were used in food or
environments that people frequent, foods that people eat a lot of or
environments that were highly frequented, such as schools or such as
occupational settings or homes. So that the idea of strategic attention on the
most toxic chemicals is an important concept. </p>
<p>So what's happened
here as you think back across history? You've got kind of a sequence of
changing regulatory priorities. And you might ask yourself, well, why is that?
So that the first attempt back in 1906 was to protect the economy of farmers
against fraudulent labeling. Then the obligation became to protect food and
crop uses. So set limits for levels of residue in different kinds of foods.
Then wildlife residues became extremely important as people worried about how
chemicals were causing decline in species that were really much loved in the
United States, particularly large raptors, bald eagles, the national symbol, or
the gold eagle, the peregrine falcon, ospreys that now you can see coming back
along the shoreline here in Connecticut, if you take the train from New Haven
up to Boston, for example, and look out over the salt marshes, you'll see these
poles sitting in the middle of salt marshes with ospreys. Ospreys came very
close to extinction because of the chemical DDT that was building up in its
body and causing its eggshells to thin so its reproductive success declined. </p>
<p>Soil contamination
became important as instances where a chemical had been used in the field one
year and had persisted in that field. Another tenant farmer comes along the
next year and plants a different crop. That crop is not permitted to have that
chemical used on it, but it absorbed the chemical up through its roots and
becomes adulterated. So that failure to think about soil contamination was
causing some foods to become adulterated in ways that were not predictable. </p>
<p>And drinking water
contamination has come late to the attention of the Environmental Protection
Agency. Why would that be? You know, if you think about water as one of the
most consumed foods in the human diet, why wouldn't the government have paid
more attention to water? Also think about indoor environments. I've come to
believe that all of the attention given to food is really probably misplaced
relative to exposures that occur in indoor environments. So that in many
situations today, people can be in rooms when they are sprayed by a licensed
applicator. So the exposures that occur after that often are far, far higher
than the exposures that come from food-borne residues. </p>
<p>The idea that the
susceptible need attention, this is new in environmental law as of 1996. And
new areas that deserve additional attention that I think are extremely
important, is the use of these chemicals as they're impregnated into a variety
of consumer products. So if you're hiking long distances, you may want a
pesticide impregnated into the fabric that you buy, if you don't have an opportunity
to wash your clothes. But what does that mean? There are a whole new array of
products in the marketplace now that carry these residues, for obvious
functions, such as durability, keeping them from degrading. Pesticides are
added to paints, for example, to keep the bacteria in paint from breaking it
down and chipping and causing you to have to repaint in a short period of time.
So that the functional side of these chemicals used in consumer products is
pretty well understood, but the long-term implications for environmental
quality and human health really are not. </p>
<p>So the underlying
problems here include the human inability to sense chemical risk. You know, we
basically don&#39;t know where these chemicals are in our environment because we
can't see them, we can't taste them, we can't feel them. We have to imply where
they are by proxy, thinking about &quot;Gee, I'm living on a tract of land and
I've got a well. And this used to be a farmland. Maybe I ought to test my
drinking water.&quot; Or, &quot;I'm living next to a field that is planted with
a crop that's routinely sprayed by a plane that flies over. Maybe the drift is
getting into my environment.&quot; So that thinking about where these things
are in the environment really demands a certain level of background literacy
and knowledge that often is not present. </p>
<p>The underlying
problem of lack of sensitivity to susceptibility is really important. Who's
susceptible? Well, the very youngest are. And remember that all these
concentrations are measured how? They're expressed per unit of your body
weight. So when in life does a human have the lowest body weight? In utero,
first trimester. So if the concentration in the mom is the same moving across
the placenta as the concentration in the fetus, and you get to an exposure estimate
by taking that concentration and dividing it by body weight, and the mom's body
weight might be 160 pounds and the fetus' body weight might be a quarter of a
pound. I&#39;m sorry Laura, about this. You get the idea. The same concentration in
the environment affects the fetus much more than it would the average adult. So
this has really transformed the way that government regulators have begun to
think about chemical management. </p>
<p>We've had poor
monitoring of chemical release. We have thought much more about chemical
persistence and environmental fate having learned from strontium-90 and the DDT
story. And we've misunderstood variability in human exposure. Still we're not
putting monitors on individual people. Although increasingly, the government is
monitoring human tissue, taking blood and urine and hair samples to try to
figure out what the matrix of chemicals might be that an individual is exposed
to. So looking not just by sampling in the marketplace, but looking at this
pattern by taking human tissue samples, this is a whole new wave that's giving
people the opportunity literally to go to a doctor and say, &quot;I want to be
measured for this entire array of chemicals.&quot; So it may cost you a couple
thousand dollars to go through that process, but increasingly people are doing
this, trying to make some sense out of the way that they feel, their medical
condition, and environmental quality. </p>
<p>Single chemical
exposure is still the focus of government. No company wants its chemical to be
compared to another company when they're making a regulatory choice. Toxicity
testing is incomplete in a variety of areas, especially relative to the immune
system. And you know the rise in allergies that we're experiencing, severe
allergies. More people are walking around with Epi-Pens today because of
worries about anaphylaxis than ever before. Something is happening to the human
immune system. It's not clear why, but many of the chemicals that are released,
such as some pesticides, do influence the human immune system. That's one example
of an area of human health that has been neglected by the government. Also, the
endocrine effects are quite misunderstood. The behavior of these chemicals as
human hormones--that we'll speak about a bit next week. </p>
<p>Also, failure of
labeling as a management strategy. Labeling is still the dominant approach that
EPA takes to try to inform the public, to educate the public how they might be
able to use these economic poisons in as safe way. But you need to think about
whether or not that's really a potentially effective way of controlling these
kinds of risks. And we're also misunderstanding trends in human illness. For
example, we had no asthma registry in Connecticut until 2003. So we couldn't
figure out whether or not people that lived in areas that have had higher
levels of air pollution were more likely to have asthma. So the absence of
surveillance of health conditions makes it impossible to correlate these
exposures to health outcomes. </p>
<p>And finally, a
variance in human capacity to manage risk. There's a real environmental justice
issue here that needs to be paid attention to, that there are many members of
society that do not have the capacity to get the education necessary to
self-manage risk. So that some people simply are more reliant on government standard
setting than other people are. So these are all underlying problems of law, and
all of them are pretty well exemplified by this history of pesticide management<i>.
