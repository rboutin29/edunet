<p><strong>Professor John Wargo:
</strong>A couple updates that
I thought you might be interested in: U.S. District Court in San Juan just
dismissed the case of 7,000 Viequense who had filed a suit against the federal
government, the Department of the Navy, seeking compensation for damages to
their island and their health. So that this suit has been in the making for
about seven years, and it will be appealed. Also the Ebling case that you may
have read about in <em>Green Intelligence</em>, the two young children that
claimed exposure to pesticides at a very young age. That is going to trial in
August now, it was just announced, after ten years. So this should give you
pause to think about the effect and cost of litigation.</p>
<p>In terms of TSCA
Reform, TSCA Reform was just introduced into both the House and the Senate, in
the Senate by Senator Lautenberg, in the House by Henry Waxman. And for the
first time in nearly twenty-five years, there's some anticipation that there
will be serious reform of the way that commercial chemicals are regulated in
the country. The chemical companies, curiously, are motivated to seek changes
in this law, because if products that they make in this country are not tested
to the same standard as product testing requirements in Europe, then U.S.
chemicals will not be allowed to be sold in Europe. So that chemical companies
are extremely concerned about the idea of harmonizing law between the U.S. and
the European Union.</p>
<p>Cape Wind has not
been decided, but there really appears to be no clear direction on the part of
Ken Salazar at this point. You should keep your eyes open for that over the
next week or so. And a diesel update. We talked about diesel exhaust and we
talked about the health consequences of particulate matter. But there is new
evidence that was released quite recently by Nadine Unger, who is going to be a
new assistant professor here next year who has worked with the Columbia
University and NASA on the effect of particles. And it's kind of a curious
effect that particles of one form, especially those that are attached to
organic matter, tend to have a reflective effect to radiation. So it basically
may have a cooling effect, whereas black carbon itself tends to absorb the
radiation, which would have a warming effect. So it's interesting. Diesel
exhaust has been fingered, identified as one of the key sources of black carbon
in the atmosphere that we need to pay much more attention to for its warming
effect on climate.</p>
<p>Happy Earth Day.
Forty years ago today, Earth Day occurred. And your parents and I probably
remember it pretty well.&nbsp; I was in Philadelphia at the time. And it was really
an interesting and highly confused time to be a college student. And what was
interesting about it is that it was a period of collision between different
social movements that really had a core based in universities. And the
collision was among the anti-war movement, the civil rights movement, as well
as the environmental movement. Nobody really knew what that meant at the time,
but sitting in Philadelphia, living in Philadelphia, watching the yellow
sunsets that occurred every evening because of the filthy air. And rowing on
the Schuylkill River with the crew team having to scrape the globules of slime
and material chemical wastes that were deposited legally into the Schuylkill
River really was an unhappy experience. So really, it was also the dawn of the
modern era of environmental law in the nation. And the Clean Air Act revisions,
the Clean Water Act revisions, the 1970s were really a time when great energy
was put into the design of environmental law. And there was great expectation
on the part of people that had worked in these movements too that environmental
quality would change quite radically.</p>
<p>So I wanted to
reflect with you today about imagining an ideal society. We think that we're
facing many very severe problems. And one of the themes of this course has been
to try to help you judge the effectiveness and potential of environmental law
to shape behavior so that people will behave more responsibly toward the
environment and protect human health and protect scarce natural resources.</p>
<p>So for a moment, I'd
like you to kind of step back away from your perception of all the problems
that we face. And instead, to have you imagine an ideal society. So what would
it look like? Well, environmental law really targets itself toward damages. So
knowledge is really a critical element of it. And the knowledge that's
necessary in order for it to be effective is quite complex. So in the ideal
world, you would want to have perfect knowledge of externalities, perfect
predictive capacity. What's the effect of my behavior going to be? You'd want
to have an efficient system for compensation for damages, because all damages
could never be avoided. You'd also want to have a literate public, a public
that was capable of understanding the technical information at a level of
detail that would make them potentially effective participants in decision
making. So literacy, the capacity to learn, is a really important component of
this.</p>
<p>You would want to
have governmental authority and the resources to regulate. So not only the
right to regulate that would be authorized by Congress or a Parliament, but
also the resources to regulate. And those don't normally go hand in hand. So
that you often get the passage of a law, but you don't get the allocation of
resources. So there's the authorization of money that's necessary, then there's
the appropriation of money that's necessary. And then EPA or whoever the agency
is have to actually expend the money in order to have an effective response. In
an ideal society, I'd say also that we need to pay, we would be paying
attention to the most vulnerable. They would be identified and they would be
protected by statute. There would be equal protection for all. And I'll talk
more about inequality in environmental law in a few moments.</p>
<p>And we would have
figured out how to manage natural resources, such as our forests, our soils,
our wildlife, in a sustainable way. And it's quite interesting. When we use the
word sustainability, I tend to cringe. It's not my favorite word. I think it's
ambiguous and I think it is used way too loosely. But where it seems to be
clearest and have provided a model for effective law has been with respect to
managing resources such as forests, fisheries, where you can monitor a
population, you can monitor its rate of growth, its reproductive success. So
that thinking about sustainable management of natural resources has been in
some instances a success story. I think I would imagine a stable climate as
well.</p>
<p>So I wanted to have
you think with me also about what's been successful? What can we point to as
success stories? And I think that a number of the cases, I chose the cases
quite deliberately for this course, and a number of them demonstrate the
potential of law to control behavior, to achieve some of these objectives. And
I think clearly, the wilderness protection system and the national park system
that we have in the United States really is the envy of many nations in the
world. So that we have effectively set aside lands and we've restricted human
access and certain behaviors and extraction rights in these areas. And that
really has been quite a successful policy. Our national seashores I think
represent a really far-sighted approach that were meant to provide recreational
opportunities in the coastal zone. But as I mentioned in the lecture on looking
at Cape Cod and Fire Island and Padre Island and Point Reyes, the fact that the
government went into those areas and bought them, or consolidated federal
ownership, is going to restrict future development in a way that will reduce
long-term costs associated with sea level rise and increased storm damage.</p>
<p>The Adirondack Park
strikes me as also being a real success story in many ways. For me, it really
represents a model for regulating private land use in the vicinity of highly
valuable public lands. And remember this park was set aside back in the 1870s.
So that the Adirondack Park Agency concept was really designed initially to
protect what they thought of as biological diversity, ecological diversity as
well as integrity, whatever that meant at the time, back in 1972, when the Park
Agency statute was passed.</p>
<p>But almost
inadvertently, they had designed an energy conservation plan that really was
quite remarkable. Remember this idea that you regulate and demand very large
lot sizes in the remote areas. And then you basically take away the density
requirements in the towns and villages. There are really no urban centers in
the Adirondacks. But this open space preservation and incentive to increase
density in the existing areas that already are developed and have infrastructure,
have roads, have electric lines, et cetera, it really is remarkable. So in
terms of an energy conservation strategy that one might embed into a land use
plan, it really was very innovative. They also used the idea of transferable
development rights in the Adirondacks that I think is a very cool idea. There's
a parallel here to the idea of setting up these ecosystem service banks.</p>
<p>So I wanted to give
you the example of a windmill, we talked about wind energy the other day. I
want to give you the idea that supposing you had property next to a windmill
and you thought that you were being adversely affected by that. Is there a way
that you might be compensated that would prevent you from litigating, that
might make you more accepting of the windmill? So imagine that you set up a
square around a windmill or a wind turbine. And you basically use the
1,000-foot or the 300-meter distance from any property boundary that's been
recommended to reduce adverse effects. So that that would constitute roughly about
a hundred acres.</p>
<p>Well supposing you
had a patch of people that lived adjacent to that land. What could you do for
them that might make them more accepting of it? Well one thing you could do
would be to provide them with development rights. But maybe they didn't want
to-- they may not want to develop on their own property. So that you could set
up a bank whereby they could deposit these development rights in that bank and
then somebody who lived in a receiving zone or purchased property in a
receiving zone, the receiving zone designed to increase density, say in one of
these urban centers that I just mentioned, then the developer that wanted to
increase the density of land that he owned or would buy in that urban zone
would go to the bank and purchase the credit so that the adjacent landowner to
the turbine would be compensated and development would be encouraged to grow
near existing infrastructure. So the ecosystem service banks that have grown up
associated with wetlands, degradation also with stream mitigation banking, they
present I think a real model for us to follow in the future.</p>
<p>The SO<sub>2</sub>
cap and trade program was clearly a success in reducing sulfur dioxides and
acid precipitation. And a variety of other cases that we went through in the
course I think also demonstrate the potential effectiveness of law. The nuclear
weapons testing ban back in 1963.</p>
<p>Population control.
If this were Earth Day back in 1970, I remember the lectures on Earth Day back
in 1970, and they were about population control. Population was thought to be
the source of environmental degradation, particularly in the developing world.
And population control efforts have been really quite successful. We haven't
discussed population control. And I'm actually a little embarrassed to be running
an environmental studies major without a demography element to it. But it
really is a very important aspect of environmental degradation. In terms
of--and as the father of children, I could think of myself as having created
with my wife beautiful young children. I could also think of it as creating
future consumers that are going to be spending millions of dollars buying goods
and services and developing land and doing whatever that would have an adverse
effect on the environment. So that the mantra back in 1970 was population
control is the primary approach that we should be taking to control
environmental damage.</p>
<p>The success in
pesticides associated with the chlorinated hydrocarbons, DDT, aldrin, dieldrin,
chemicals that would bioaccumulate. We really learned the bioaccumulation story
predominantly from strontium-90 back in the weapons testing era. But then it
was repeated in the 1960s and 1970s. And these compounds were successfully
phased out. It was one of the first objectives of William Ruckelshaus when he
became the first administrator to the Environmental Protection Agency. And you
can see in the graphs the steady decline in concentrations, not just in birds
but in fish and other wildlife, as well as in human tissues. A great success
story. And that also was modeled in the history of lead. And as lead was taken
out of gasoline, as lead was taken out of paint. You can see the concentrations
declining and the nations children and in other nations where lead was removed.
It's really a very striking success story.</p>
<p>Chlorinated
fluorocarbons, known to adversely affect the stratospheric ozone layer were
removed from aerosols. PCBs were removed from transmission tower coolers and
other electronics, they also had built up and bioaccumulated in wildlife as
well as human tissues. The prevention of use of asbestos as a building
material. Our tobacco regulations. We have one of the lowest adoption rates now
than has existed at any other point previous in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>And food safety. You
may think of food safety as kind of an odd topic, but in low-income parts of
the world, food safety is a major source of illness. And even in this country,
the estimate by the Centers for Disease Control of the number of illnesses per
year experienced by contaminated food is seventy-six million. That's an
enormous issue. It has to do with the availability of water and the control of
microbes and the way that food is handled and washed and stored as well as how
it's cooked. The organic food movement has been successful. It's, as I
mentioned earlier, the most rapidly growing sector in the food industry. And
drinking water quality. Poor drinking water quality in low-income parts of the
world is a major killer. The World Health Organization estimates that well more
than a million children die from contaminated water each year. We also suffer
much less from respiratory infections.</p>
<p>So forgive me as the
computer for some reason is running through each one very slowly. Come on.</p>
<p>So in contrast to
where law has worked well, where has it not worked well? Well I think fossil
fuel policy has been disastrous, especially the kinds of subsidies that we've
allowed the industry to receive. And I mentioned that simply the absence of
investment in public transit and the enormity of the public investment in
highway development and highway maintenance. Our renewable energy policy has
also been a disaster. And despite the improvements and the increase in funding
that's going into renewable energy, it's nowhere near sufficient in order to increase
the proportion of renewable energy that is necessary to deal with the CO<sub>2</sub>
problem that we face.</p>
<p>Personal consumption,
individual consumption, individual purchasing is going up, as are the number of
people in the country. We're at about 310 million people, we're projected to go
to about 350 in about the next forty years and perhaps reach 400 million people
in the nation. So you multiply consumption of each individual times that scale,
we're sitting in a nation now where we have roughly 250 million automobiles.
And we're likely to see that rise quite substantially. So that people have fled
to the suburbs. Now they can't sell the property in the suburbs, even if they
wanted to live in an urban area, because of the declining land value.</p>
<p>Parks and protected
areas are not being created any longer, so that the rate of adoption of parks
and protected areas, even though I just claimed that they were a great success
where they were created, the rate of establishing parks and protect areas has
fallen off quite dramatically since that time. The Park Service's land
acquisition efforts have declined.</p>
<p>Biological diversity
loss is also increasing as a function of habitat loss, as a function of
chemical applications, pesticide applications. Marine species exploitation is
increasing. The rate of extinction is increasing in the world's oceans, driven
in part by changing water quality in the coastal zone, but driven also by
unregulated fishing, particularly beyond the 200-mile limit.</p>
<p>The outdoor as
opposed to indoor focus of the Environmental Protection Agency has been a
serious problem. If you gave me a sample of your blood, of your urine, of your
hair, and we went down to CDC and had it tested, we would find a variety of
chemicals that come from the built environment. So that the absence of
attention to where we spend our time, which is indoors, is important. There was
a new study that was just released that announced that the average amount of
time spent by the nation's children outdoors is now forty-two minutes per week.
The average amount of time that children now spent in front of electronic media
is now fifty-two hours per week. So there's something to that statistic that is
worth paying a lot of attention to. I'm here because my dad took me hiking when
I was a kid. He took me to parks. We'd hang out by streams. He'd take me down
to the beach. But this is an increasingly rare experience, as people are
spending more time indoors and more time staring at electronic equipment.</p>
<p>Hazardous sites; we
are adding the number of hazardous sites to the lists maintained by the
government, the federal government and state governments every year. So that
we're not restoring more than we're adding. And this is a very serious problem.
And the lessons of Vieques, the long amount of time, the enormous resources
necessary to clean these facilities up, now you should think about that. In
five years, in six years as you think about where you want to live, where
you're going to rent a house or an apartment. You think about where you want to
buy a house or buy land, you should pay a lot of attention to the land use
history in these areas so that you can be sure that you're buying land that was
not formerly a disposal site. Chemicals in commerce, plastics in our bodies,
and product labeling is really one of the weakest among the higher income
nations in the world.</p>
<p>Another key issue
that I'll talk about a little bit more in a minute is what I call narrative
advantage. And if you think of the variety of different sources of our
confusion about what to buy, how to behave, what energy consumption is
associated with the purchase of an apple as opposed to a hamburger. As you
think about how much we don't know, think also about how much what we do know
and how our impressions are created by the narrative advantage of the powerful.
The narrative advantage of the corporations as well as government, so that they
are basically framing the issue about what's worth worrying about.</p>
<p>I wanted to also say
that we did not have a chance to talk much about CO<sub>2</sub> trading
programs. But we have a very active and important one ongoing right here in
Connecticut as we're part of a ten-state plan to reduce CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions from the power plants in this region. And this was adopted as law in
nine of these states, but not in New York. And it's interesting that one energy
company, the Indeck Energy Company, sued the State of New York for creating cap
and trade regulations with no statutory authority. So could New York establish
cap and trade regulations and impose it on the utilities in its state without
statutory authority? So this case is still pending. The other states have
adopted this approach. So that for all the utilities or for the largest
utilities that contribute CO<sub>2</sub> in this region, there has been a
ceiling that has been established. And between now and 2012, the ceiling will
be stable and then it will decline as total amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted
that's allowable will be reduced and they will have to retrofit, they will have
to fuel switch in order to figure out how they're going to meet that ceiling.
It's a very important approach.</p>
<p>So if you think back
on what are the key problems with our broad body of environmental law, well,
it's fractured by problem. It's fractured by media, by air, water, food,
consumer products. And often these problems evolved case by case and motivated
political action in individual states or motivated the legislators in those
individual states to approach Congress and suggest that this is an example of a
problem that exists in every state, we should pass national law to address it.
But each law is set up very differently. It was not set up based upon a certain
set of overriding guiding principles such as exist in the European Union. And
I'm going to make a few comparisons in a few moments to European environmental
law by contrast. It's fractured by level of government, so we have law that is
established by local governments, state governments and the federal government
that is often incompatible, and it's extremely confusing for those that want to
develop, such as the wind turbine farm, Cape Wind up in Massachusetts. It's a
classic example of regulatory confusion and the litigation and delay and cost
that ensues.</p>
<p>We have little
surveillance at the scale that's relevant to the individual, and something that
we have not spoken about that's really important is that environmental
monitoring responsibilities and surveillance responsibilities have largely been
delegated to those that are regulated over the past several decades by the
Environmental Protection Agency. So that's an interesting idea. I mean, if you
are say the maker of benzene, you are responsible to report your benzene
emissions from your smokestacks to the Environmental Protection Agency. There's
no one else that is independent that monitors it. Or is there no monitoring
equipment that reports directly to the Environmental Protection Agency. So
thinking about the way that the surveillance system is set up is really
critical to the long-term effectiveness of environmental law.</p>
<p>The next point is the
pace of regulation. And I just mentioned the pace of litigation a few moments
ago. The pace of regulation is often slower than litigation. So that you would
want a system ideally to be responsive to newfound evidence of risk. So
supposing I found that chemical X in the food supply is exceptionally dangerous
and people are highly exposed and they've got it in their tissues. Well,
following that discovery and following a consensus among scientists that that
is a significant threat, it normally takes ten to fifteen, and I've seen twenty
years with respect to pesticides, before the government responds and then
changes the regulation to lower the allowable use of the chemical or sets a
different ceiling on it. And this basically-- law has the effect then of providing
a false sense of security when you think, my gosh, we have three dozen statutes
in place, we must be reasonably well protected as a society. Well, I think
after this course, you will be more skeptical.</p>
<p>It's difficult and
costly to measure effectiveness. And when ineffectiveness is found, agencies
are not happy about that. So that that's why we have a Government Accountability
Office that commonly will look at the behavior of agencies and whether or not
the statute is achieving the Congressionally mandated intent. Our law system is
highly specialized in the sciences, and it often takes scientific training at a
graduate level in order to be able to debate about the appropriateness of
certain standards. Similarly, if you're arguing about the effect of human
development on endangered species habitat, it takes expertise and biology,
often at the graduate level, to get a seat at the table. So think about that.
If you're considering a future in environmental management of one sort or
another, think about how you might shore up your technical capacity.</p>
<p>It's highly
centralized in decision-making. It's really difficult in order to participate
in decision making at the federal level of government. There are action
channels and there are groups of people that are well known to the regulators
that play a disproportionate role in making choices that have a much more
highly distributed effect.</p>
<p>So I'm not going to
go through all these different kinds of decision standards, but we've touched
on a variety of different approaches to setting standards in different laws.
Remember the federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act at the top
here. It was a risk-benefit balancing law. Think about the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act as it applies to drugs. That's a risk-risk tradeoff law. So that a
doctor prescribes the drug to you because the doctor thinks that although there
may be a risk of a side effect, that the benefit to you is higher, it's more
significant than the side effect risk. Cost-benefit analysis is another form of
decision-making analysis that is often demanded in environmental law. Risk
ceilings, acceptable risk levels. I've seen acceptable risk levels for
cancer-causing agents in the environment that vary between one excess cancer is
allowable per thousand people exposed as opposed to a standard that would
allow, a California standard, one excess risk in a million people exposed. And
I've seen other proposals for one in ten million. So that the idea of
acceptable risk is quite variable, and it can have an enormous effect on the
allowable concentration of a compound out there in the environment.</p>
<p>The sustainable yield
definition, there's the Multiple-Use and Sustainable Yield Act that applies to
the U.S. Forest Service. And this is a really interesting idea as well. But
it's technical. So that one would have to look at a national forest and figure
out how much timber it normally produces, how much could be harvested without
adversely affecting the sustained yield at that level. So being able to
identify the sustained yield and to develop an understanding of how you go into
an area and you get the timber out without depleting the soil resources say of
organic matter, water holding capacity, that's a technical issue.</p>
<p>Density restrictions,
land use segregation, disclosure and transparency requirements, certification
requirements inside the Food Production Act. The reasonable certainty of no
harm standard in the Food Quality Protection Act is the most rigid health
protective standard that we've got in the United States. It's as health
protective as any statute also in the European Union.</p>
<p>And also
technological feasibility. So what's feasible now as opposed to technology
forcing standards that would demand that industry say, lower their auto
emissions down to a level that's not possible now, but you give them a ceiling
and say that you've got five years to reach that reduced ceiling. Restricting
false claims of benefit or demanding expression of risk, so product labeling.
And then restoration standards that exist inside the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act and the Superfund law. So that there are different forms of
standards, different decision making criteria and analyses across these laws.</p>
<p>I wanted to compare
for just a couple of minutes some key principles of law. So I just said that
U.S. law has evolved incrementally in a patchwork quilt fashion with a variety
of these different standards that were in the last slide. How about European
law? Well, European law evolved based upon a collection of principles, principles
that are not embedded in all of our laws. So we have no law in our country that
basically forces the statute to comply with principles such as exist in the EU
law. One is a high level of protection is demanded, but not the highest. And
this would force the definition of what high means, and it has and it's
produced litigation. The precautionary principle that despite uncertainty in
the effect of timber harvesting on endangered species habitat or of a chemical
on human health, despite the uncertainty, it is a better idea to be
precautionary, to set a standard that would be protective. And this is quite
similar to another principal that they call the prevention principle, that
prevention is better than the cure.</p>
<p>And they also have
the source principle, that a problem should be managed at its source, rather
than down the road. So you know, if you have a nasty pesticide, are you going
to manage that pesticide by allowing farmers to use it and then going out and
monitoring its presence in the water supply or in the foods that you eat?
That's managing at the downstream level, as opposed to at the source. So nip it
in the bud. If it's a really dangerous chemical, prohibit it or don't allow it
to be used under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>The polluter pays
principle that dictates that polluters are financially responsible for the
pollution that they emit from their smokestacks, from their pipe, their
waterline discharge points, and that they are also responsible for damages. And
they're responsible for coming up to solutions to the problem that they're
creating. And also, that they are open to liability claims.</p>
<p>And finally, the
safeguard principle that member states in the European Union have the authority
to adopt tougher laws given their particular conditions. Now, when I say that,
I know that these seem like they're kind of dry principles. But when I say
that, the bell that should be going off in your head is a bell about preemption
and how important it is to think carefully about when, under what circumstance
do you want to preempt a lower level of government, say France, from adopting a
tougher level of regulation than the European Union? Or when do you want to
have California be given the authority to adopt tougher air quality regs as
opposed to those that are established by EPA? So that the safeguard principle
cuts across all European law that gives the member nations the authority to set
standards that are tougher than the Union's.</p>
<p>I want to talk just a
couple of minutes about poverty and the environment. And we haven't spent much
time on that during the course. But the impoverished in the world generally
face degraded environmental conditions compared to the more wealthy. And these
are often ignored by governments. Exposures to hazards are normally higher. The
poorest are left to the most marginal lands. It's kind of interesting to watch
what happens in a town, even in Connecticut, when developers have built on all
of the really nice lands, and then you have the old down dump, the landfill,
that nobody wanted to live near and remained undeveloped. But as the towns
reach build out, meaning that all the other lands have been developed to the
zoning density limit, then increasingly, you see lower income people moving
into those areas.</p>
<p>There was the Bhopal,
India chemical release back in 1984 that killed tens of thousands of people and
injured hundreds of thousands of others. Those people had basically migrated
next to the chemical company and set up camps that made them immediately
adjacent to the edge of the chemical company. And that history, I encourage you
to take a look at it. The chemical release of methyl isocyanate killed or
injured people in a matter of several hours because they were so close to the
plant, there was no buffer zone to it. So the poor tend not to have access to
capital. They tend not to have insurance. They tend not to have the capacity to
understand and to manage risk the way that the wealthy do. Healthcare
surveillance is something that they cannot afford. And litigation is rarely an
opportunity.</p>
<p>So as you think about
the relationship between environmental problems and the fascination and the
drive that our nation has to grow, to produce more, to consume more, to become
wealthier, I want you to think more carefully about this. I want you to think
about whether or not this fascination with growth, of bigger is better, really
is something that we need to confront more directly. The ethical effects of
pursuing more, more wealth, really have a variety of dimensions. So that as you
think about your own behavior, your own pattern of consumption, if you think
about whether or not you really need that next iPod, the next iPhone, or the
next iPhone app. If you think about the kinds of foods you want to buy in the
marketplace and you start thinking about these as ethical choices and about how
they may cause a distributional pattern of costs and benefits out in ways that
may not be easily identified.</p>
<p>So as wealth
increases, the opposite argument might go, so do the following. Control over
modes of production, control over labor and providing labor with certain rights
that they might not have had so wealthier nations tend to have higher
protective standards for labor. They have higher standards for the control of
materials. There's another mode of production, component of the mode of
production, as well as regulations on the use of capital. And the wealthier
nations in the world also have more control and accountability that's demanded
of government. They have higher education, higher capacity to identify risk.
And as wealth increases, environmental controls, regulations become more
sophisticated, as does the capacity to buy insurance, access to health care,
and the capacity to select risks and avoid them.</p>
<p>So one idea, thinking
about whether or not there is a trickle-down effect. So as the world becomes
wealthier, as the high income nations become wealthier, is there going to be a
trickle-down effect, or should we systematically think about how we might
redistribute wealth, knowledge, authority and a sense of a collective ethic?
And will this be a stairway to improved environmental quality and human health?</p>
<p>I wanted to just
mention too, and emphasize this idea once more of narrative advantage and how
critical it is, given the scale of money that's being put into advertising. So
half a trillion dollars per year in the world going into advertising, promoting
products, promoting economic growth and making claims about product benefits
and normally not fully disclosing what product risks or product long-term damages
might be. We talked on many occasions in the course about the idea of ignorance
as being an underlying source for environmental problems. So I don't mean
ignorance in a demeaning way at all. I don't mean it to infer the absence of
capacity. I mean it to infer the absence of knowledge or the incapacity to
develop that knowledge but for no reason of personal problem, personal
incapacity.</p>
<p>So what are the
underlying sources? Well, illiteracy is clearly one of them. Secrecy is
another, deception is another, privacy is another, language barriers. But I'm
increasingly fascinated by the idea that legal control of knowledge in the form
of trade secrecy and classified information are really critical targets that we
need to manage more effectively in order to create a literate society that
might be able to participate in markets as well as in government decision-making
in ways that will lead us to a more health protective, environmentally
responsible future.</p>
<p>So secrecy has a very
insidious and negative effect. And we've seen it in a variety of cases. It
concentrates knowledge among those with authority and power. It actually is a
form of social control. So if I have knowledge and I withhold for you because
it basically will prevent you from being able to compete with me, then that
basically is a form of-- its authority, it's power for me to be able to control
you. Secrecy inhibits public intelligence, and it enhances the persuasive power
of elites, again providing narrative advantage.</p>
<p>Throughout the
course, across all of these cases, I have mentioned the importance of looking
at distributional effects and avoiding what I call here the veil of averages.
If you allow yourself to be convinced of arguments based upon statistical
claims of the effect on average is going to be X, or even the benefits on
average are going to be Y, then you should not do that. You should think much
more carefully and deeply about distributional patterns in society. How is risk
distributed? How are benefits distributed? Is there an overlap among the risks
and the benefits? Do we want to structure law in a way that encourages that to
be transparent and overlapped?</p>
<p>So I'm going to close
here, and I'm going to just take a little bit of license, and I apologize for
this, because you may think of me as being paternal. But this class represents,
I believe, a class where I've now taught about 2,500 Yale students. And this
has given me a perspective on the success of my students as I watch them down
the road. What careers they take, how they come back and want recommendations.
But also want to let me know that they're taking some ideas into their future.</p>
<p>So what advice could
I give you? Well, I would encourage you to think really carefully about what
drives you morally. What are your dominant moral values? And I've got kids your
age. I say that to them, "Give me your top five dominant moral values. And
learn to understand how those values might guide your behaviors." And in my
life, I've often concluded that boy, if I'd just listened to that inner voice that
would have told me what the right thing to do was and it would have been a
better decision. So learn to trust your instincts about what's really important
in your life. It's not just about getting richer. Learn yourself and then teach
others. You're at one of the most prestigious and one of the best educational
institutions in the world and it's just such an incredible privilege for you to
be here. But I think now about it, the educational experience that you're
getting, not in my course, but in better courses, as a privilege, as something
that really you have an obligation to carry on, to expand the knowledge of
other people.</p>
<p>Lead by example.
Don't just tell people what to do. People see you being focused and disciplined
and taking on the toughest and meanest and nastiest and dirtiest jobs, they're
going to respect that and they're going to follow you. So focus and discipline
is really a key to success. I would encourage you to reduce your access, your
reliance on electronic media. I see students walking down the road holding
their cell phones in front of them, no conversations at all. I mean, the value
of conversation is enormous compared to the value of communication via
electronic media. Body language, understanding how emotion and rationality are mixed
up in language. You don't get that from Twitter, you don't get that from
emailing people. So I'd encourage you to think carefully about the amount of
time that you spend your life in that way.</p>
<p>I worry a lot about
what's going to happen in future generations because of the way that your
generation and those younger are spending their time. Not going out, not
experiencing the wild, not experiencing the natural. I mean, I can't imagine
that people would have the passion to care about the wild and the natural or
the pure, the chemical free, if they had not experienced it themselves. And
that's the reason that I take my classes out to the Adirondacks. Or I've taken
them to Wyoming or to other places, because many people just don't have that
experience. They were not lucky enough to have the experience I had when I was
a kid.</p>
<p>Consume what you
need. Think really carefully about what you need. And how much space do you
need? My argument with Kroon Hall, how much cubic feet of space do you really
need per person in Kroon Hall as I look up at that forty-foot high ceiling.
Yes, it's grand. Architecturally, it's a wonderful esthetic experience. But in
the new age of being concerned about energy consumption and renewables, is that
a luxury that we can really afford?</p>
<p>Know what you're
consuming. If anything, you should walk away from this course being skeptical
about this issue. It's hard to do. What's in your environment? What do you need
to protect yourself against? Drive less. Self-propel yourself more. It's not only
good for the climate, it's great for your health. You'll remember the design of
that Centers for Disease Control building, specifically designed with that
staircase that is beautiful. A beautiful staircase with light glass panes going
up the side of the stairwell that encourages everybody to get to their office
up on the seventh or eighth floor by walking up the steps as opposed to taking
the elevator that's in the back of the building.</p>
<p>Become politically
active regardless of your party. Show up. It's really pretty remarkable, and I
hesitate to say this in a class where I know a bunch of you have not shown up
all the time. But a lot of success is involved in the social relationships that
you develop just by showing up and paying attention. You know, I have thought
long and hard whether or not I wanted to adopt Harvard Law School's prohibition
of the use of laptops in the classroom, and I've decided not to do that. So I
mean, I figure that if I can't engage you in a lecture, and if I regulate your
use of laptop, then I shouldn't regulate it. But I also feel that those of you
that are not paying attention, you know, there are probably some pretty good
reasons for it.</p>
<p>And the most
important lesson I think I have for you is to be confident about yourself. And I
want you to think about this one really carefully because my belief is really
that you wouldn't be here at Yale if you did not have the capacity to change
the world. Now, you know how many Yale leaders have had enormous influence in
corporations, in government, in the nonprofit community. So that capacity, it's
an enormous gift. And I'll leave you with one final reflection is that you may
think it's really hard to induce change in the world, but it's not. It's really
not. If you demonstrate your passion, you develop the knowledge, you develop a
coalition, you can make change at any level of government. So be confident
about yourself and go in peace. So thank you very much for a great term.</p>
