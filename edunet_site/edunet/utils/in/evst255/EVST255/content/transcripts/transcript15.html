<p><b>Professor John Wargo</b>: All right
everybody, let's start in. So the midterms are graded, for those of you that
are not doing the paper. And you'll receive them back on Thursday in class. And
people for the most part did quite well. So it's good news. </p>
<p>Today I want to talk
about tobacco and the legal paradigm that surrounds tobacco, because it really
provides I think an interesting comparison to some of the other legal regimes
that we've taken a look at so far in the course, including those that surround
air quality, pesticides, atomic weapons testing, hazardous sites, and plastics.
So how is tobacco managed? What's its history? And I have come to think about
this history really as a conflict of perceptions of rights and obligations,
particularly the right to participate in markets, the right to speak freely,
the right to advertise, as opposed to the right to be free from exposure to
chemicals that are recognized to be quite hazardous. So all these cases that
we've looked at so far during the term really have raised questions about risk
and different approaches to managing risk. </p>
<p>What are the
different legal strategies that you might think about to take on a hazard such
as this? Well one is taxes. We'll take a look at tax policy and how tax policy
creates a dependency relationship between an industry and governments,
particularly at times like this of budgetary stress. We'll take a look also at
place-based restrictions. So preventing the sale of certain hazardous
commodities in certain kinds of environments so that we can no longer purchase
tobacco products in vending machines in the United States. Instead they have to
be purchased over the counter by someone who would check identification. Sales
restrictions of different sorts, advertising restrictions, fair warning
requirements on tobacco products. Also compensation, how are we going to manage
compensation for those that claim that they've been harmed by the products? How
are we going to subsidize the industry? You probably know that many different
commodities, agricultural commodities, receive rather high subsidies. </p>
<p>So what has been the
relative history of tobacco subsidies compared to other commodities? How about
regulating the chemical content of tobacco, flavoring agents, coloring agents,
the shape of tobacco? How about tobacco products designed to sooth? Or how
about the regulation of nicotine itself, known to be addictive? How about the
ban on all tobacco products? Has anybody thought about doing that at any scale?
Well, many governments have chosen to ban use of tobacco products inside
buildings, so public buildings commonly now restrict the use of tobacco
products. Also, how about socializing the industry, an idea that Kessler came
up with at the end of his book. </p>
<p>So what's the scale
of this issue in terms of economics? About fifty billion dollars today in
consumer spending and about fifty million people in the United States smoke
approximately 600 billion cigarettes each year. The overwhelming majority of
those cigarettes, by the way, are lit and smoked indoors so that this is very
much an indoor air quality issue. About four billion cigars are smoked also,
forty million pounds of tobacco are burned indoors every year. </p>
<p>How about tobacco-related
illnesses? There's very little debate about this, compared to the other types
of problems that we've looked at that are managed by environmental law,
including pesticides, including air pollutants, drinking water contaminates
managed by the Safe Drinking Water Act or chemicals that are migrating from
hazardous waste sites. The quality of the scientific evidence about the effect
of tobacco on human health is really the gold standard. It's similar in quality
to our understanding of the role that radiation plays in inducing cancer. There
are also about 470,000 different suppliers, wholesalers and retailers that are
highly dependent upon this industry. So this is a recipe for enormous conflict
in Washington about how to use the different strategies that I just went over. </p>
<p>So the way that the
laws have evolved in the U.S. was laid out I think fairly well in Kessler's
book. The strategies that the government has relied on have included hazard
warnings predominately, control over advertising claims and the use of specific
media outlets, age restrictions so that within the United States right now the
use of tobacco products, the sale of tobacco products is restricted to those
that are eighteen years and older, although there are some states and some
counties that now demand that you need to be nineteen years old. For example,
in Nassau County, Suffolk County in New York, demand that you be nineteen years
old. If you look around the world too, there's quite a bit of variability. In
some of the poorer nations of the world, you need to be ten years old. In
France, you need to be sixteen years old. In Japan, you need to be twenty years
old. So that the idea of age-based restriction is really quite variable across
different jurisdictional boundaries. Restricting access, making certain that
you can't just walk up to a machine and put your now seven or eight dollars
into it to get your pack of cigarettes out. The removal of subsidies, but not
prohibition. So that Congress considered a variety of strategies, but they always
backed off of prohibition. </p>
<p>How about industry
strategies to maintain their share of the marketplace, what have they done?
Well, one of the first things that they did was to focus the issue, focus
government's attention on labeling. And as with pesticide labeling and the
labeling of pharmaceuticals and food products, labeling is a problematic form
of conveying a sense of risk. This is especially different than pesticides or
some drugs in that the product itself is addictive. It's addictive
predominately because of the nicotine content. The industry also fought to
confuse the evidentiary base on health effects. So just like nuclear weapons
and just like pesticides and pharmaceuticals, the knowledge about the danger
grew from the industry research itself. So the American Tobacco Institute, for
example, might be thought of similarly to the Atomic Energy Commission or to
the pesticide companies that conducted their own analyses of data so that they
became the source of data to demonstrate the absence of a clear understanding
about adverse health effects. </p>
<p>Also in advertising,
they really took very bold moves--and I'll go through a variety of different
advertising strategies today with you--to associate tobacco use with the ideas
of freedom, values of nature, also sociability and sexuality. So the imagery is
very important. It's extremely important, and also quite persuasive to the very
young. They focused on the costs of regulations, not the costs of healthcare.
And it's quite interesting to think about the sea change that occurred as a
result of litigation in Florida against tobacco companies that resulted in a
settlement. So that many attorneys general in the United States banded together
and were able to reach a settlement for approximately two hundred and fifty
billion dollars to be paid out by the tobacco companies to different states,
year by year. A study at Yale just a couple of years ago demonstrated, by the
way, that the money that came into Connecticut did not go into educational
funds, educational programs to prevent tobacco use or to increase the rate of
quitting of tobacco use. Instead, it was diverted into a variety of other state
needs. So this balancing of the costs of regulation, as opposed to the benefits
of the product, has been central in their logic. </p>
<p>Also, the idea of
preemption. Just as pesticides are preempted so that they can't be regulated
differently, the labeling can't vary from state to state. So that the tobacco
companies went to the federal government and were successful in preempting state
and local regulation regarding both labeling and tort litigation. So preemption
basically prevents this patchwork quilt of regulations from being imposed on
the industry. </p>
<p>If you look at the
variability of taxation by state, it's also quite curious. So that in the state
of Rhode Island, the state tax is about two dollars and forty-six cents per
pack, whereas the state of Kentucky it was down to three cents per pack, and
this is several years ago. So states have the authority to set taxes at
different levels. To give you a sense of the magnitude of importance to a
state's budget the sales tax represents, if California increased the sales tax
by only fifty cents, it would raise nearly a half a billion dollars per year.
If New York would increase their taxes by about fifty cents, they would
increase their income, their revenue, by about a third of a billion dollars per
year. So that states have become quite highly reliant upon these sales taxes as
an important form of income. </p>
<p>How about some of the
statistics about smoking prevalence in education? So as I said at the beginning
of the lecture, about fifty million people out of a few over three hundred
million people in the United States smoke. But what about their level of
education? And what you see is that current smokers tend to decline as a
percentage with education. Less than high school, you see here the current
smoking rate is much higher than it is for those that have a university
education. So that those that understand the health effects are less likely to
adopt tobacco use and they're more likely to consider quitting. So to give you
a sense also of the magnitude of tax revenue across some of the larger states,
the U.S. income is now well over ten billion dollars per year that states
enjoy. </p>
<p>Tobacco also has been
a target for subsidy removal. So compared to corn as an example, corn enjoys
about a one and a half billion dollar subsidy, or did in 2004, whereas tobacco
subsidies are less than a billion dollars today. Advertising is a very
important component of the cigarette companies' budgets, so that they are
spending today close to twenty-two billion dollars on advertising and
promotional expenses. And this amounted to about fifty-three dollars for every
person in the United States. This is a twenty-two percent increase over
previous years. So what you find is, as the market goes down, as the adoption
rate among the young go down, they will vary their targeting of advertising by
gender, by ethnic group, as well as by age. So that expenditures for advertising
have increased in response to an increase in regulation and these declining
adopting rates. </p>
<p>Targeting children
through advertising is an important thing to consider. And kind of curiously,
children played an important role in the evolution of prohibitive policy with
respect to nuclear weapons. They played an important role in the control of
lead. They played a really important role in the adoption of the tougher
particulate matter standards for pesticide restrictions. So that in this case,
recognition that children are especially susceptible to persuasion by
advertising has similarly led to recent more restrictive legislation. </p>
<p>So Joe Camel provides
a pretty interesting example. This series ran between 1988 and 1997. And about
three thousand new smokers less than eighteen years were picked up per day. And
about a third of these people, if they persist in their habit, will die of
tobacco-related illness. The appeals are well known to everybody. Here you see
Joe Camel with a woman, an attractive woman in the background. The image is
tough, the image is one of a fighter pilot. And there he is, smoking his
cigarette. The idea of this series was modeled after a television show called <i>Miami
Vice</i>, really modeled after James Bond and Don Johnson. And one study showed
that nearly a third of all three year olds matched the character to the
cigarette brand. And among six year olds, Joe Camel was as familiar as Mickey
Mouse. So within a matter of three years, Joe increased Camel's market share
from one to thirty-three percent in the less than eighteen year old range.
Sales increased during that three-year period by five hundred million dollars
per year. And this is believed now to be one of the most successful advertising
campaigns in history. </p>
<p>Now think about the
imagery as well. So here on the left-hand slide, you see a woman having
presumably just reached a mountain peak and then reached into her pocket for a
Lucky Strike. The Marlboro Man, also the image of masculinity riding a horse,
having just roped a steer, also a key symbol for the corporation. Looking back
in history, you can see also the appeal to women, and particularly as a weight
control strategy. So &quot;to keep a slender figure, no one can deny it's wise to
reach for a Lucky.&quot; And also the appeal to keeping mom on a steady course. So
here you have a child in the ad, &quot;Before you scold me, Mom, maybe you'd
better light up a Marlboro.&quot; And &quot;Gee, Mommy, you sure enjoy your
Marlboro.&quot; So things seem happier in the family. So somebody's cranky and
associate the use of tobacco with a mood swing. </p>
<p>Physicians were
enlisted to support advertising as well. So here you see some ads from the
1930s and 1940s. It's actually interesting, you can go back through these old
volumes of <i>Life Magazine </i>or<i> National Geographic </i>or<i> Time
Magazine </i>over in Sterling Library and take a look at the patterns in
advertising over time. So, &quot;Twenty thousand, six hundred and seventy-nine
physicians say Luckies are less irritating,&quot; and &quot;It's toasted.&quot;
&quot;More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette.&quot; Dentists also
were part of the advertising game. Anybody that has smoked or knows smokers
know that cigarettes generally stain teeth, especially those without filters.
So the idea that putting a filter on the end of the tobacco could remove the
dangerous product, it could remove the discoloring agents in the compound,
that's an interesting idea. Santa Claus even got into the act for a while. So &quot;guard
against throat scratch.&quot; </p>
<p>There's also a long
history about reliance on gender. And women have been extensively targeted.
Women tend to have lower adoption rate than men do by four or five percent in
the United States. And the dominant marketing strategy has been one to rest on
themes of both social desirability and independence. And these are normally conveyed
by thin, attractive, and athletic models. This history goes back quite a ways,
and you see it in different parts of the world as well. So that the highest
estimates for cigarette smoking among women tend to be in the southern and
tobacco-growing states, such as Kentucky, where it's about 28.1 percent.
Whereas nationally, only eighteen percent of women smoke. </p>
<p>Also, you can
recognize certain patterns of reliance of different brands on different types
of imagery. So whereas Marlboro concentrated on kind of a machismo image of
masculinity, Virginia Slims instead concentrated their efforts on women. Always
slim women, always tough women, &quot;Yeah, I got a tattoo and no, you can't
see it.&quot; So the image of sexuality and also strength dominated their
imagery. </p>
<p>The tobacco companies
also tried to influence cultural acceptance of tobacco products by encouraging
actors to smoke on stage, encouraging producers, providing subsidies so that
tobacco use was noted in about seventy-five percent of all movies that were reviewed
several years ago and forty-three percent of the movies showed scenes in which
tobacco use could be interpreted as attractive, with qualities described by
teenagers as sexy, exciting, powerful, cool, sophisticated, rebellious, and
celebratory. And twenty-five percent of the movies included some of the
anti-tobacco statements. Top-billed actors lit up in fifty-nine percent of all
movies reviewed. </p>
<p>Another example of
Virginia Slims advertising. Riding a motorcycle. The idea that you would take
on risks, not only riding a motorcycle, but also riding without a helmet. So
that the idea that you&#39;re tough, you're attractive, you're slim, these are all
images that are very strategically designed to encourage adoption rates. In
different parts of the world, you find different ethnic groups being targeted
using a variety of different strategies. So Virginia Slims also tried to create
the idea that independence and cultural pride are linked to tobacco use. So
that there's a terrific amount of variability. </p>
<p>Also, the promotion
of different kinds of events. When I was a kid and we'd go to rock concerts,
people would commonly be there with these big trays hung over their shoulders
with sample-sized tobacco packages, four or five cigarettes in a carton, and
they were given out freely. In some bars, the promotional activities also
freely distributed tobacco products. In this case, you probably recognize or
knew that different kinds of races and athletic events were sponsored by
different groups. Virginia Slims, for example, was quite active in promoting
tennis tournaments. The Virginia Slims Invitational is an example of that.
NASCAR racing was promoted by Lucky Strike. The Marlboro 500 is another stock
car race. </p>
<p>My dad, when he was
in World War II, he would, after he came back, he always told stories about his
K-Ration Kit. So that they were given K-Rations, which often included Spam, but
also peanuts and chocolate bars. And he would tell about always having a
cigarette pack freely available to all the GIs. What a brilliant advertising
technique, recognizing the addictive power of tobacco, how few cigarettes it
really takes to cause a physical addiction, and putting them into every
K-Ration, virtually ensuring that you would have a high addiction rate among
the GIs once the millions of soldiers came back to the U.S. </p>
<p>Today, if you look on
the internet, you'll find a variety of different advertising schemes in
different parts of the world. RJR Stir the Senses campaign is a good example.
And some of them include product auctions and encourage you to become a member
so that they can advertise and provide you with information about different
kinds of discounts on products as well as to promote their products. </p>
<p>Now, different
countries too have taken different approaches to labeling. And you know that
I'm not a great fan of labeling as a way of conveying knowledge about risk. And
I don't think that it really often helps a consumer to understand the true
benefits as opposed to the adverse effects associated with products. But the
Canadians have taken a tougher stance than we have in the United States. Now in
the U.S., you know that we have these little boxes on the sides of the packets,
or sometimes on the backs of the packets, that may say &quot;Warning: This
product is known to cause cancer,&quot; or &quot;This product is dangerous to
your health,&quot; or &quot;This product causes emphysema or exacerbates
asthma.&quot; So that there are a variety of different signal phrases that are
required to be cycled through on the sides of tobacco products. Canada has a
system whereby they demand that the front of the package include photographs of
health loss. </p>
<p>So here's an example
of what a heart looks like after it's had an attack, the darker area, for
example, in this photo. Another example, cigarettes cause lung cancer. So
someone on a heart-lung machine lying in a hospital. Cigarettes hurt babies, so
that an appeal to protection of the unborn and of children, getting people to
think more carefully about what they're doing to their young. And something
that might wake up teenagers, tobacco use can make you impotent. Can make you
impotent? That's news to many people. </p>
<p>There are also
prevalence rates that vary by ethnicity so that American Indians and Alaskan
natives, for example, have adoption and prevalence rates that are far higher
than we have in other ethnic minorities. And also, Asians have one of the
lowest adoption and addiction rates in the nation. </p>
<p>Most smokers begin as
teens. And this is quite interesting to me when I saw this. David Kessler
showed this slide to me. I'm going to show a series of slides that he provided
when he used to lecture in this course. And you see that the adoption rates
begin at a very young age, so that up to twelve, thirteen percent occur beneath
the age of twelve. Beneath the age of fifteen, you see roughly twenty-five,
fifty, maybe about fifty percent of the age of adoption. So that the target of
youth has become a very important aspect of advertising campaigns among the
tobacco companies. </p>
<p>In fact, RJ Reynolds
in 1984 stated that &quot;young smokers had been the critical factor in the
growth and decline of every major brand and company over the last fifty
years.&quot; So if you can addict a single individual who is fifty years old,
you will have a much lower rate of return than you would if you could addict a
fifteen year old. Another comment by an RJ Reynolds executive,
&quot;Realistically, if our company is to survive and prosper over the long
term, we must get our share of the youth market.&quot; And speaking again, the
executive says: </p>
<p>&quot;Evidence is now
available to indicate that the fourteen to eighteen year old group is an
increasing segment of the smoking population. RJR must soon establish a
successful new brand in this market if our position in the industry is to be
maintained over the long run. If we are to attract a nonsmoker or pre-smoker,
there is nothing in this type of product that he would currently understand or
desire. Instead, we somehow must convince him with wholly irrational reasons
that he should try smoking.&quot;</p>
<p>Very interesting
idea. So here you have a product that would be disgusting to many people that
had never tried it. I remember when I smoked my first cigarette, I just coughed
and sputtered, my eyes watered, I hated the taste and I hated the smell that I
carried around. And so that this was well recognized by the industry that they
needed to create other factors that would encourage people to adopt. </p>
<p>Now how about the
legal framework that this sits within? Well, the Surgeon General's report that
was released in 1964 was the first thorough and comprehensive indictment of the
effect of tobacco products on human health, concluding that it did induce lung
disease. So that the Federal Trade Commission at that time began to regulate
advertising. And it concluded that cigarette advertising was deceptive, that
advertisers had a responsibility to warn the public about the health hazards of
smoking, and that the Federal Trade Commission then proposed labeling the
amount of tar and nicotine and include a statement such as &quot;Caution: Cigarette
smoking is dangerous to health. It may cause death from cancer or other
diseases.&quot; The idea of preemption originated with respect to tobacco
products back in 1965. And it prohibited the Federal Trade Commission and
States and local governments from requiring any other label on cigarette
packages and any warnings to cigarette advertising at least until 1969. </p>
<p>There's also the
Federal Communications Commission that plays an important role here,
particularly the Fairness Doctrine. So by 1967, more money was spent on
television tobacco advertising than for any other product. And in 1966, a
citizen, John Banzhaf, wrote to CBS TV in New York and requested that some
other responsible spokesperson be given a chance to present contrasting views
on the issue of the benefits and advisability of smoking. And the FCC responded
and required a significant amount of time to rebut tobacco advertising,
concluding that &quot;We hold that the Fairness Doctrine is applicable to such
advertisements.&quot; The Fairness Doctrine has its origin in 1949 in a rule
that required broadcasters to devote some of their air time to discussing
controversial matters of public interest and to air contrasting views regarding
those matters. </p>
<p>In 1969, the Public
Health Cigarette Smoking Act was adopted, and it demanded a cautionary label
with a key change in the phrase. So that &quot;The Surgeon General has
determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health,&quot; not
&quot;may be dangerous to your health.&quot; It also required a blackout of
cigarette commercials as of January 1971, and television and radio stations
estimated a loss of about two hundred and twenty million dollars in revenue. So
recall that I argued that this industry creates a very large revenue base for
states. It also created a terrific revenue base in terms of advertising for the
communications industry. What this means is that the industry support was quite
varied and quite wide and diverse, that the tobacco industry had the capacity
to go to Congress and find allies that would not be immediately intuited. So
about seven and a half percent of their total advertising revenue had been
associated with the tobacco industry at the time. </p>
<p>So warnings,
advertising, and age restrictions between 1965 and 2008 became the key targets
of Congress when they enacted six different statutes. And they required that
all packaging have labels on it. They required that the advertisement of
tobacco products through any electronic communication medium would be
prohibited by the Federal Communications Commission. And it also required,
these statutes required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report
every three years to Congress on research findings concerning tobacco's
addictive property. </p>
<p>Kind of curiously, to
combat the origin of the scientific studies occurring predominately within the
industry, the National Institute of Health started funding independent studies.
So that just as you find in the pharmaceutical industry or in the pesticide
industry, the conduct of independent science really became quite important to
the government's capacity to mount a challenge to the evidence that was
presented by the industry itself. Also, these statutes made states, the receipt
of certain federal block grants contingent upon their prohibiting tobacco
product manufacturer, retailer, or distributor from selling these products that
included not just cigarettes but also cigars and chewing tobacco to individuals
under the age of eighteen. </p>
<p>So what are the
estimated health effects from tobacco? Irritation is well recognized. Lower respiratory
infections were recognized early. Reduced lung function. Increased risk for
asthma and exacerbation of asthma among those that had it previously.
Nonrespiratory cancers. Early onset of menopause. Also environmental tobacco
smoke can cause brain tumors and cervical cancer. That's environmental tobacco
smoke, that's not smoke that's inhaled by the smoker. </p>
<p>There are really
three different kinds of smoke that a cigarette would produce. One is the smoke
that's inhaled through the tobacco itself as it burns. The other would be
what's called side-stream smoke that is given off by the burning tip of the
product. And the third would be the smoke that's exhaled. So each is a
different complex of compounds, between three and four thousand different
chemicals. So it's really been a very difficult task understanding which of
these chemicals is responsible for which of these health effects. But this,
it's an interesting problem. It's similar in respect to diesel emissions, which
is also a complex mixture, so that the effect of the mixture has been the
subject of study, as opposed to the analysis of individual components in the
mixture. So exposure during pregnancy harms the fetus, and synergistic effects
exist with radon, the natural gas that's given off by granitic rock that we
have here in Connecticut, and the combination is known to cause lung cancer. </p>
<p>Environmental tobacco
smoke has increasingly become a target of regulation. And its relationship to
heart disease is well supported by about thirteen epidemiological studies, now
fourteen. Environmental tobacco smoke is responsible for other kinds of effects
that include heart disease, impairment of platelet function, damage to the
inside lining of arteries, interference with oxygen delivery and use by cells.
And it can also depress cellular respiration and enhance fatty deposits on
vessel walls that can exacerbate cardiovascular and neurological illnesses. </p>
<p>In 1997, a Harvard
study of thirty-two thousand nurses was released, and found that the relative
risk of coronary heart disease among those that smoked [correction: nonsmokers
living with smokers] compared to those that did not was about two. So there was
a two-fold increase of risk of heart disease among those that smoked. And they
attributed sixty thousand additional deaths each year in the United States to
environmental tobacco smoke. So that it wasn't until the late 1990s that these
estimates of health loss associated not from smoking but being in an
environment where others smoked became quite sophisticated. A twenty-fold
increase in death from lung cancer was attributed to environmental tobacco
smoke as stated in EPA's 1992 Passive Smoking Report. William Riley was the
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency at that point in time and
he also is a Yale graduate and returns to Yale quite often. And I spoke to him
about his effort inside the Environmental Protection Agency in the early 1990s
to have environmental tobacco smoke declared to be a dangerous substance and
more heavily regulated. And he thought that that was one of the most difficult
fights that he had as administrator during the early 1990s. </p>
<p>The chemicals found
inside tobacco smoke are all chemicals that you'll recognize as hazardous
substances. Carbon monoxide, nicotine, carcinogenic tars, ammonia, nitrogen
dioxide, vinyl chloride, cyanide, formaldehyde, radionuclides, benzene,
nitrosamines, aromatic hydrocarbons, benzoate, pyrene, and arsenic, all of
these compounds are the target of regulation under different statues. So it's
quite remarkable that we've been allowed to burn cigarettes in indoor
environments. </p>
<p>So why has indoor
environmental quality and this problem escaped the attention of the
Environmental Protection Agency? Well, it really has to do with private
property rights and the perception of being free from government regulation
inside your own home or inside your own office. But it is quite curious. The
question about who should pay for tobacco-related illness has prompted much
more vigorous regulatory action and really was the basis for David Kessler's
initiative inside the Food and Drug Administration that you read about in his
book, <i>Question of Intent</i>. </p>
<p>So in 1994 a new law
was passed authorizing the state of Florida to sue cigarette manufacturers to
recover their Medicaid funds used to treat people that had tobacco-related
illnesses. So states began to recognize that their expenditures to pay for
these illnesses were enormous. They were in the multiple billion dollars per
year. The law was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court and as of 1997, forty-one
states banded together to sue the tobacco industry to recover these Medicaid
costs. The state settlement, as I mentioned earlier in the lecture, is
estimated to be about $250 billion. Additional private litigation has also gone
on in different states against different corporations. States have also, kind
of interestingly, borrowed against their anticipated tobacco payments. And many
believe that states have become addicted to the tobacco money produced as a
result. </p>
<p>So the EPA, in 1990,
began attacking passive smoking as being causally associated with lung cancer
in adults. And it listed environmental tobacco smoke as a group A, or a &quot;known
human carcinogen.&quot; You may think this is kind of a modest difference in
classification, but there are relatively few known human carcinogens that are
recognized by the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control,
the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and the World Health
Organization. So that the listing of the product as a known human carcinogen
gave the government an increased step that they could use to-- an increased and
powerful lever that they could use to step up their encouragement to prohibit
tobacco products from being used in public buildings. EPA estimated in 1992
that as many as three thousand nonsmokers die from lung cancer every year. </p>
<p>There are different
roles that EPA has played. And if EPA has been responsible for environmental
tobacco smoke or second-hand smoke, the FDA has been thought of as the target
for regulation. And that story is told, I think very, very well by David
Kessler. So that FDA's question really surrounded two issues. One, whether or
not nicotine is considered to be a drug, because under the Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, FDA eventually claimed jurisdiction based upon its finding that
nicotine was a drug. And if so, then it [the tobacco industry] needed to
receive a license from the Food and Drug Administration. And the second
question is, under the statute, is a cigarette itself or a cigar a drug
delivery device for the drug? And if yes, it should be regulated and possibly
prohibited under the statute. </p>
<p>So this question
about addiction is quite interesting. So if you look at a sales weight in
nicotine and tar levels in smoke, back as early as 1982 you found that as a
percentage of the 1992 level between '82 and 1991, you find that the nicotine
levels in cigarettes increased. The tar levels went down, predominately as a
product of filtration. But something was going on. And what was driving this
increase in nicotine? In fact, curiously, the amount of nicotine in light
brands that emerged during the '80s and the 1990s, were found to be higher than
in the regular brands. This didn't seem to make much sense. They also realized
that if you pluck the tobacco leaves higher up on the stalk, that they had a
higher nicotine content in some species of plants. So that that meant that the
tobacco growers, the tobacco processors, had the capacity to manipulate the
nicotine level based upon the location on the stalk that the leaf was plucked

<p>So the question again
that faced the Food and Drug Administration was, isn't nicotine a drug? And
here's a comment from Sir Charles Ellis, from the British American Tobacco
Company Research Conference in 1962. </p>
<p>&quot;It's my
conviction that nicotine is a very remarkable beneficent drug that both helps
the body to resist external stress and also can, as a result, show a pronounced
tranquilizing effect. Nicotine is not only a very fine drug (he continued), but
the techniques of administration by smoking has a considerable psychological
advantage and a built-in control against excessive absorption. We are, then, in
the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug...&quot;</p>
<p>By the way, these
were comments made at a private and confidential conference that were
eventually disclosed by the Food and Drug Administration in its discovery
process. And you can read more about that and the role that Deep Cough played
in giving the Food and Drug Administration, and particularly Kessler, guidance
in how to get access to some of this information that was not in the public
domain. He continued: </p>
<p>&quot;We are of the
conviction that the ultimate explanation for the perpetuated cigarette habit
resides in the pharmacological effect of smoke upon the body of a smoker. Think
of a cigarette pack as a storage container for a day's supply of nicotine...think
of the cigarette as a dispenser for a dosed unit of nicotine... think of a puff
of smoke as the vehicle for nicotine...smoke is beyond question the most optimized
vehicle of nicotine...&quot;</p>
<p>So going back to
these original transcripts of meetings held within the tobacco industry,
Kessler felt that he had discovered yes, they believed that this was a drug.
They believed that it was addictive, and they were thinking themselves that the
cigarette and cigar wrappers were drug delivery devices. &quot;In a sense, the
tobacco industry may be thought of as a specialized, highly ritualized, and
stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry.&quot; Again, this is Claude Teague.
&quot;Tobacco products uniquely contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug,
with a variety of physiological effects.&quot; </p>
<p>They also discovered
that the companies were engaged in plant breeding, trying to genetically
engineer strains of tobacco plants that would produce higher levels of
nicotine, particularly a strain known as the Y1 nicotine strain. So the
percentage of nicotine in Y1 was about three-fold the content of normal
flue-cured tobacco. And the ammonia, they found was capable of liberating free
nicotine from the blend in which it was associated, and it increased the impact
of satisfaction. So adding ammonia as a chemical component of the tobacco
product would increase the delivery of nicotine. </p>
<p>So I'm going to stop
there. We're just about at time. And we'll come back to the more recent
revisions to law, particularly the statute that was adopted last June, and
signed by President Obama, and compare that statute to the Food and Drug
Administration's proposed regulations when Kessler was then the FDA Commissioner.
Thank you.</p>
