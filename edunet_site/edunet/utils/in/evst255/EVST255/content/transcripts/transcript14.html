<p><b>Professor John Wargo:</b> Today I want to talk
about what I think of as one of the most significant failures of environmental
law in the twentieth century. And this is the way that we manage toxic
substances. But this is a story that is more about not just the individual
chemicals but also the products that are created when chemicals are merged
together, they're synthesized. </p>
<p>So what is the
plastics problem ? In part, it&#39;s the enormity of the industry. About 119
billion pounds now produced each year in the United States. This is roughly
about a $400 billion industry. And I mentioned earlier that just to give you a
point of comparison to the pesticide industry, the pesticide industry produces about
ten billion pounds. So it's about ten times smaller than the plastics industry.
And the annual sales from pesticides are about ten to twelve billion dollars
per year in the nation. So compared to the attention that pesticides have been
given over the past thirty to forty years, the plastics problem has been just
about fully neglected by Congress. Although it did pass the Toxic Substance
control act back in 1976. And this law was intended to encourage premarket
testing of chemicals. And what we'll see today is that the majority of
chemicals remain untested, that the ingredients are unlabeled, the country of
origin is unknown for most products. The recovery rate is exceptionally low.
And recycling failure occurs for many reasons, but we'll explore several of
those later in the session. </p>
<p>Environmental
contamination at a global scale has occurred. There are plastic particles,
molecules in ambient air outside and indoors. Plastics have contaminated
underground aquifers as well as surface waters in many parts of the
industrialized world. There's been universal human exposure. That exposure is
chronic, you get it on a daily basis. And the health effects that we now are
beginning to understand have to do predominately with endocrine disrupting
compounds, chemicals that are mimicking human hormones. We rely, unfortunately,
for the most part on animal studies to give us some insight into what the
effects on humans are likely to be. But we rely on that evidence for many other
classes of compounds as well. </p>
<p>So this area has
received virtually no attention from the Environmental Protection Agency, and I
want to talk a little bit today about why that is. So 850,000 people employed
in this industry. That number 379 is now up about $400 billion per year, and
plastics comprise seventy percent of the synthetic chemical industry in the
nation, including 500 different resins. </p>
<p>Plastics labeling is
confusing to many people. You may not look on the bottom of a milk carton or
you may not look on the back of many different products to look at the
recycling code. The recycling code in the United States is completely
voluntary. There is no legal obligation to post the chemical content, the
origin of the plastics or what should be done with it once the product is
discarded. </p>
<p>So, give you an
example here. Polyethylene, PET, has the symbol number one. So bottled drinks
such as Pepsi and Coca Cola are packaged in PET. Sometimes it's called PETE,
polyethylene. There's a high-density version of that, which is number two. And
there's a low density version of that, which is number four. So carrier bags
and bin liners, for example, are the low-density polyethylene as opposed to say
the gallon milk jugs which are the high-density polyethylene. The polyethylenes
are the most likely to be recycled among all plastics. Polyvinylchloride, by
comparison, PVC for short, is contained in many different products. Water
pipes, and I'll show you some examples of that in a few moments. It's almost
never recycled, which means that it's either buried or it's burned once it is
finally discarded. Polypropylene, you may find polypropylene in rugs. You can
find it also in margarine tubs, different kinds of food packaging products. But
also in these microwavable meal trays. </p>
<p>Polystyrene, most
people understand what styrene is. You are all familiar with styrene balls. But
it's also an absorbent material that's put at the base of meats in packaging.
And I mentioned to you that the packaging problem is, especially related to
food, is incredibly complex. There's no way for you to know what chemicals are
in the packaging materials that you buy in the grocery store. </p>
<p>Seven is reserved for
other kinds of plastic resins. So only those that do not fall into the other
categories are given the number seven. And we'll concentrate on one of those
today, which is called bisphenol-A. Bisphenol-A is what's used to form
polycarbonate plastic that's very dense, very hard, and often it's in clear
form. It can be colored. So Nalgene bottles are a good example of number seven,
the polycarbonates. And also you might think of the headlamps on a car or a
motorcycle helmet or a visor. These are all examples of polycarbonate. </p>
<p>Here is a chart that
lists the recycling rate in yellow for all the different classifications. And
you basically see PVCs are at the bottom of the list. So PVCs are not recycled
because the chemical content is so complicated. The highest degree of recycling
occurs with the polyethylenes. So the PETE bottles have roughly a twenty to
twenty-five percent recycling rate on average in the United States. And this is
highly variable by region in the nation. And also by time of the year. The
polypropylene is almost never recycled, nor is polystyrene. Polycarbonates, the
hard plastic composite that exists, for example, in my glasses, these are also
almost never recycled. So what happens to them? </p>
<p>I'm going to take you
on a quick Cook's Tour of plastic in your life. And you remember that I
challenged you to try to find out if you could avoid purchasing plastics for a
week, and if you are able to do that, I challenged you to avoid using plastics
for a week. And I believe that today is a virtual impossibility. So I started
to do a little inventory in my own life and actually got quite disturbed at
myself and my own ignorance and what I had exposed my family to. And I became
extremely interested in trying to kind of reconstruct why I was so clueless
about the thousands of different products that had made their way into my life
and into my family's life. </p>
<p>Contact lenses are a
good example. There are hard contact lenses and there are soft contact lenses.
The hard lenses could contain bisphenol-A, it's a polycarbonate. The softer
contact lenses that will change their shape with your eye or as they rotate
across a surface that is not completely even, those contact lenses normally
contain phthalates. Phthalates are softeners, so bisphenol-A is the hardener,
phthalates are softeners. And these phthalates are a particular problem with
respect to one, which is called diethyl phthalate, DEHP, that I'll talk about a
little bit later. </p>
<p>My daughter wears a
retainer. She's ten years old, my youngest daughter. And I don't know what's in
that. But I would imagine that it's predominately polycarbonate. She wears it
about twelve to fifteen hours per day. And also, most people have dental
sealants. Dental sealants are pretty interesting. So that you can test people's
saliva after the dental sealants are put in and you can find the bisphenol-A in
the saliva. Also, there's a protective characteristic of these sealants. They
prevent you from getting cavities that would demand putting a different kind of
plastic into your tooth or a metal amalgam. And many people in my generation
and my parents' generation have fillings in their mouths that include metal
amalgams, including compounds such as mercury. So it's a very interesting kind
of a tradeoff one might make. </p>
<p>Think about different
other sources of plastic in your life. Most of you are probably familiar with
that smell of the vinyl shower curtain when you first open the package and for
a couple of days it's off gassing in your bathroom. Different kinds of
clothing, raincoats, fabrics, GORE-TEX, for example, are made out of different
plastic resins. And these also are generally non-recyclable. </p>
<p>And I want you to
think about the built environment. When a house is built in the Northeastern
part of the U.S., it's generally framed out of wood. You see the plywood there
that's being tacked onto these two by fours or two by sixes. And then you see
the plastic sheathing that is being attached made by DuPont called Tyvek. Tyvek
is an interesting product in that it seals the house from mold. And that also
has a protective effect in that molds are known to threaten human health and
induce asthma or exacerbate it, as one example. But this product also is
extremely rarely recycled. </p>
<p>Tyvek also you can
find in a variety of different settings. Here's a Tyvek disposable coverall
that is claimed by the corporation to protect against more than 150 hazardous
chemicals. So for those people that work with hazardous chemicals, here's a
product that helps to protect them. The idea of it being disposable caught my
attention. It's advertised as being disposable. Certainly most things are
disposable, but that doesn't give you any clue about where they might end up
eventually in the environment. In this case, this will not break down for
probably hundreds if not thousands of years. </p>
<p>Now think about a
house. This house has plastic in many different areas. It's got vinyl siding on
it, it has pillars, you can see pillars here on the front and over on the side.
You might think those pillars are formed out of wood or perhaps that they're
ceramic, but they're generally plastic. You see the light post, that's plastic
as well. You see the railing on top of the front porch near the front door
here. This is also probably a polyvinylchloride plastic. Also the doors are
commonly plastic. The windows, the window frames are plastic. And how do they
seal? When your door shuts, it doesn't shut with hard plastic meeting hard
plastic, it's got a separate liner that lies next to the door that will absorb
the shock and also it will prevent heat from escaping. So generally with a
window, you'll have several different kinds of plastic, the same with doors.
The vent that you see up here near the peak of the roof also would be plastic.
So that the exterior surfaces of this structure are predominately made out of
plastic. Many paints also contain plastics within them. </p>
<p>Think also about cord
or wire. Wire is generally coated with vinyl, polyvinylchloride. And just as an
example, there are, in a new building like Kroon Hall, where I've got my
office, there are probably hundreds of miles of electrical conduit that
circulate through that single building. And then think about power lines and
the sheathing that exists on the power lines. Well how many miles of power line
do you think there are in the United States? Well, one thing you could do is
you could just calculate on Google, type in number of miles of roads in the
United States, because most roads are also corridors for power lines. So I
would estimate that we probably have hundreds of billions of miles of
electrical cable that's sheeted in polyvinylchloride, all of which is not
recyclable. Interestingly, the value of copper inside the wire is high enough
to encourage its recycling. But the value of the PVC is negligible. </p>
<p>Now I'd also like you
to think about your own water supply. Think about where you grew up. Do you
know where your water came from? Do you know how it was piped to your facets?
Well, here's an example of a water supply being fed by copper pipes at the top.
And then there's a distribution network throughout the house, going to say the
refrigerator or going to the kitchen sink, going to toilets in different parts of
the house. Well this also is made out of plastic. And one would think that
somebody would have demanded that these chemicals be tested to understand
whether or not they would leach out of the lines. And in many cases,
particularly with newer houses, you'll have a filtration system. And you may
have seen these cartridge filtration systems. They look like canisters. They
come in various sizes. I've got one in my house that's a sediment filter as one
example. And it was put in before I understood this whole plastics issue. And I
also can tell you that it's almost impossible to find a water filter that's not
made out of plastic. So within this plastic canister, it's got a top that
screws on. So to change the filtration you take the filter material out and then
you put a new one in after a certain number of months. So that most water
filters also are plastic. Also, nobody asked the question, well, what's
leaching out of the filters into the water line? </p>
<p>Now I'd like you to
think about the vehicle environment. It's kind of interesting. I use the phrase
that people are spending in the United States about ninety percent of their
time indoors. Well it's about eighty-seven percent of their time indoors and
it's about three to four percent of their time within vehicles. And think about
the interior cabins. On the upper left here, a new vehicle, so that this
probably has maybe a couple of dozen different polymers in it, ranging from the
TV screen and all of its components down through the plastic steering wheel,
plastic dashboard, the plastic console between the seats. Different kinds of
plastics in the seat itself, including the polyurethane foam inside the seat,
almost none of which are recyclable. So eventually most of these parts that are
made out of plastic are simply going to be burned, which gives off quite a bit
of energy in an incinerator because of a high carbon content in the plastic. So
remember that most of these plastics are derived from what? They're petroleum-based.
So that it's very important to recall that fossil fuels, oil is the predominant
source of plastics. </p>
<p>The interior of a
subway or in this case, and Amtrak train on the upper right, also is
predominantly plastic, as is the interior of an airline cabin. And this is all
for an interesting and really important purpose. And that is to lighten the
weight of the vehicle. So thirty years ago, vehicles were much heavier than
they are today. So an average vehicle today might be 2,500 pounds, but an
average vehicle perhaps forty years ago was perhaps 300 or 400 pounds more than
that. Indeed, there are about 300 pounds of plastic in every new vehicle. And
it's pretty much guaranteed that that material would not be recycled. </p>
<p>Also, I'd like you to
think about coatings, the whole idea of coating things. I realized that fairly
late in my career that I hadn't paid any attention to coatings. But if you
think about the number of buildings that exist in the world, the number of
buildings in the United States, think like say Sherwin Williams, the paint
industry. You know what their phrase is? You know what their corporate motto
is? Their corporate motto is &quot;Cover the Earth.&quot; And you see this red
paint, their symbol is red paint that is flowing down across the top of a
globe. Well, think about the surface area simply of this room. Think about the
surface area in your house. The flooring, think about the walls, think about
the ceiling. And if you're an executive for a paint company, you're thinking
&quot;Oh my gosh, we have such a huge market. Everybody is going to want to
paint something a different color, and should we make the paints to be more
stable or not quite as stable so that they would want to repaint after a
certain number of years?&quot; </p>
<p>So just as another
example, I've done this myself, I've refinished floors, which is a pretty nasty
business. You don't want to spend much of your life refinishing a floor,
especially if you are dressed such as this gentleman is, with no respirator on.
Because he's breathing in a pretty nasty mixture of dusts that include of
course the wood flooring, but it also includes the plastic, the polyurethanes
that are put down on the floor. You can see them right here up on the podium.
You can see the shiny coating on top of the desk, and you can see it also on
the desks on the side of your chairs. So that the number of surface coatings in
the world is enormous in area, and we don't really think about the long-term
consequences of that. </p>
<p>What would happen if
we didn't coat these surfaces? What would happen to the floor? I mean, could
you wash it? Could you not put a coating like polyurethane or varnish on walls
like this? Would they decay or break down more quickly? And the answer is, no.
And I've been wondering about that and I've been wondering about the origin or
aesthetic of smoothness. We love smooth things, whether or not it's skin,
whether or not it's a surface. If something is rough and harsh then it has a
negative attitude toward it. So if you're in the business of making these
coatings, you play on that. Also, if you're in the business of selling
cosmetics, you also play on that. </p>
<p>What about other
sources? I've mentioned fragrances in the past. These two contain plasticizers,
diethyl phthalate has been found in a number of common perfumes as well as in
some air fresheners. And also, think about other kinds of products in your
life. Now why is a diaper absorbent? Why is a personal hygiene product
absorbent? Well this diaper has probably two or three different kinds of
plastic within it. And what's going to happen to this? Well certainly, it's not
going to be recycled. It's likely to be burned or buried. </p>
<p>Think about where you
sleep. What is your mattress made out of? Anybody here know exactly what your
mattress is made out of? Well, it's a very difficult thing to discover. Again,
there's no requirement to label the content of your mattress or your pillow.
You get a broad description of it, like polyester filled, polyurethane foam,
but you really don&#39;t know what the environmental fate of these compounds might
be. </p>
<p>So what I'm doing is
I'm painting a picture for you here that we're all as innocent, you're all as
innocent as I am in thinking that, well, somebody must have been paying
attention to this. Nobody would really want us to be lying with our noses
within a half an inch of a surface where we had no understanding of what the
chemical content is. </p>
<p>Think about toys.
Ninety percent of the toys produced in the world now, between eighty percent
and ninety percent are produced in China. And increasingly, they are made out
of plastic. You know, consider yourself to be the executive of McDonald's and
you're thinking about the introduction of a new meal, a new supersized meal or
maybe an environmentally responsible downsized meal. What are you going to do?
Well, one of the first things you're going to do is you're going to try to
contract out with a toy manufacturer to try to figure out what the next toy is
going to be that you're going to give for free so all the children, when they
come to McDonald's, will sit and play with the toy while they eat their hamburger.
Well, what happens to those toys? The overwhelming majority of them get
discarded within a week of when they're issued. And these also are not
recycled. </p>
<p>Think about your own
entertainment, what you purchase. And by the way, all of these toys are wrapped
in plastic of different forms. And think about the polycarbonate CD disc, the
number of CD discs that you have lying around your house or your apartment or
your dorm room. And think about how you bought it? Well, it came in a cover
that looked something like this. And it probably was also wrapped in some other
additional kind of a vinyl coating, plastic coating on the outside that makes
it actually difficult to get the disc out, at least in the store in an
unobtrusive manner. So think about your iPhones, think about your iPods, think
about your computers, think about your electronic world. </p>
<p>I want to talk a
little bit more about food. Because food, as it turns out, is now believed to
be the predominant source of chemical components in plastic that are now
measurable in human tissues. And I'd like you to think also about the way that
we store food, the way that we buy food, the way that it's processed and how
it's packaged and sold. And it's done in very specific ways to promote its
freshness and to avoid food-borne illnesses, and this is very important. But we
haven't been thinking ecologically about how to manage this problem, because
really no one has designed these products so that the end of the life fate is
being considered. Indeed, no producer really has responsibility for disposal or
the ultimate fate of the product. </p>
<p>Think also about your
electronic world with respect to computers. I became fascinated when I read
that a printer I was using had ink in it. And the ink, I mean obviously, the
printer is formed predominately out of plastic or different kinds of plastics,
including the electronics board. But I didn't know that the ink itself could
have plastic in it. Why would ink have plastic in it? Well, it turns out that
the plastic in bisphenol-A has an effect on paper that it prevents the ink from
spreading into the fibers of the paper once it's applied. This is apparently
more common with the inkjet printers or the heat-driven printers that you get
as a credit card receipt. </p>
<p>Think also about
bisphenol-A and polycarbonates and the next generation of water bottles and
containers. So that many people have recognized now that when infants are fed
formula, it's very common for a mom or a dad or whoever to fill up a bottle, a
plastic bottle, either with hot water or to put it in the microwave. So that
the idea that heating of these products could energize the molecules and cause
some of them to migrate into the food or the liquid itself, this was not
tested. It was not required to be tested in a sufficient way by the Food and
Drug Administration. Although the Food and Drug Administration has the legal
authority to do so. </p>
<p>So what I'm doing is
painting a picture here that the Environmental Protection Agency has the
responsibility to implement the Toxic Substance Control Act. They have not
required prior testing. They have not demanded that hazardous components, those
chemicals that are found to adversely affect the health of other species, that
they be eliminated from the product. And there's no labeling involved, either
in the country of origin or in the chemical composition of the product. So
there's absolutely no way that the consumer has to discriminate between a safe
or unsafe or environmentally responsible products. </p>
<p>Also, I want you to
think a little bit more about what we drink from. And many of these containers
have some fibers, plant material in them. But they are often coated with
plastic as well. This is a typical grocery store. And the next time you walk
into a supermarket, I hope you walk down the aisles. And I want you to pay
special attention and look particularly for products that are not wrapped in
plastic or they're not stored in plastic environments. </p>
<p>The same thing goes
with respect to Coke. I gave a lecture similar to this several months ago. And
I was struck. A gentleman came up after the lecture, he was a very heavyset
guy. And he said, &quot;I drink three to four liters of soda every day.&quot;
And he said, &quot;From what you said, I'm worried about the plastic chemicals
migrating into the liquids and whether or not it's building up in my
body.&quot; I'm thinking, oh, three to four liters of soda per day. That's not
good with respect to the sugar alone. And he said, &quot;Well, from what you've
said, the internal lining of the cans is lined with an epoxy resin that often
contains bisphenol-A. Now, should I choose to drink Coke in cans or should I
drink the Coke out of these liter bottles that are made out of
polyethylene.&quot; Well I said to him, I thought for a couple of minutes and I
said, &quot;Well, you know, I think I would avoid the cans because at least the
polyethylene does not have a hormonally active compound in it such as
bisphenol-A. </p>
<p>Well he was not
pleased about the story. But it gives you some insight into the way that the
epoxy resins are being used in order to prevent oxidization on the inside of
all sorts of cans. Canned tomatoes, think about your dining hall, any of you
work in the dining hall, think about the large cans that they have their food
delivered within. And all these are potential sources of exposure. </p>
<p>Think of the way that
meats are packaged, that are wrapped in vinyl that are sitting on polystyrene,
none of which is recycled. What happens when you get your food home? Well, you
bring it into a refrigerator. And where do you store it? You store it inside
plastic bins. And my refrigerator looks quite a bit like this. </p>
<p>And what I am not
showing you here is the water supply. So that some refrigerators have a little
interior cut out in the front door where you push a glass into it to get fresh
water or it's an ice dispenser. So that tracing the origin of the water to that
will lead you to plastic tubing, which is made out of a phthalate, could be
bisphenol-A. What happens to all these products once we get rid of them? Well,
it's kind of ironic that we take them out and we put them in a plastic trash
bin. I just walked in past Vanderbilt Hall and you all know the walkway. And
there are about fifteen or twenty different plastic garbage cans all lined up.
What happens to those when they crack? Where do they end up? Similarly, most
will end up either underground or they will end up in incinerators. </p>
<p>Think about sports. I
was thinking about Lindsey Vonn. And as I was skiing over Christmas break, I
thought about my own gear that I have on. I had plastic skis on, I had plastic
boots on, I had a plastic polycarbonate helmet on, I had plastic goggles on, on
top of my polycarbonate plastic lenses. I had a Gortex jacket on, I had
waterproof pants on that not only were synthetic and formed at least in part
out of plastic, but they also had been applied with a waterproofing agent that
we talked about earlier, a compound that basically is designed to prevent
molecules from resting on them. So that they shed water, they shed stains,
stain-resistant chemicals. And also, I had underwear that was long underwear
that was made out of fleece. Fleece is polyethylene often. And fleece actually
can be recycled, so that some people claim, such as Patagonia, that they use a
certain percentage of recycled polyethylene when they make some of their
products. The poles themselves are made often out of plastic, as are the
handles and the baskets. So that just about any sport you can imagine is now
dependent quite heavily on plastic. The sleds that they use, the sled that won
the Games the other night for the U.S. has an outer shell that would be
polycarbonate, so it would have reduced weight but great strength. </p>
<p>By the way, I really
appreciated plastic in my car about two years ago. I was driving down
ninety-five [Interstate 95] and I was rear ended by a maniac who was going
about ninety-five miles an hour, the police estimated. And I was doing about
seventy or seventy-five. But my car survived quite well. It's a Toyota. And the
Toyota absorbed the shock in the back and I fishtailed back and forth in the
passing lane and eventually brought my car over. I got out and looked at the
back and the back end was all banged up and smashed up. And that's when I
realized, boy, they really have a system down here with these collapsible
bumpers where they have different kinds of plastic that are lined up that have
different degrees of hardness in them to basically distribute the energy from a
crash. So the use of plastic compounds for their lightness, for their energy
conservation, for their safety, it is clearly growing in public acceptance. </p>
<p>Think also about
other recreational equipment. Many of you may have a Camelbak. What's in a Camelbak
anyway? Well, it's a plastic bladder made from polyurethane, but it contains no
bisphenol-A or no phthalates. There is an antimicrobial silver lining. So when
people started realizing that they didn't want to buy the sport bottles, such
as Nalgene because of bisphenol-A, Camelbak was quite fortunate that they had
chosen a different material. And think about stainless steel bottles, such as
these Klean Kanteens. These are not lined with an epoxy resin that contains
bisphenol-A. </p>
<p>And I told you the
story about my own well water. But this is a good example here of a tank that
also has a-- this is my water supply. A tank that has an epoxy resin coating on
the inside, and then over here on the right-hand side, you can see that
canister, that water filter that I was describing to you earlier. </p>
<p>Think about the Brita
filter system. Brita also is made out of a plastic polycarbonate and also a
styrene. And if you pay attention to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the
Safe Drinking Water Act, you know that bottled water curiously is under the
jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration, whereas EPA is responsible
for tap water. That really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. There's a
separate set of compounds that one might expect in bottled water, based upon
the potential for the compounds to leach from the plastic into the water. </p>
<p>So overall, the
plastic problem is that it surrounds us, we live in it, we eat from it, we
drink it, we play with it, we work with it, we listen to it, we watch it, we
cook in it. So where is this material going in the environment? For one of the
phthalates, the DEHP I mentioned earlier, here's an example of mean
concentrations detectable now in the environmental. It's detectable in surface
water. It's detected in ground water. It's detected in drinking water. It's in
sediments in the bottoms of lakes as well as streams and rivers. It's found commonly
in soils. It's found especially in soils that are beneath landfills. So when we
buried the plastic material, nobody thought about how bad the soil
contamination might get, how concentrated, and where it might migrate and could
it get down into the underlying aquifer. It's found in indoor air, 109
nanograms per cubic meter. </p>
<p>It's found in outdoor
air, which to me is really quite surprising. Again, this is a function of the
sensitivity of the detection technology. But this is really quite a comment on
our neglect of chemicals and misunderstanding their movement through the
environment and their ultimate fate. It's detectable inside in house dust. It's
detectable in waste water. That should be no surprise. And why would that be?
Well, my gosh, I mean, we're feeding ourselves with water that's coming in
pipes that are made out of plastics, and then we're disposing of waste, the
drainpipes themselves are polyvinylchloride. So why wouldn&#39;t you find residues
in the waste water? </p>
<p>And for me in one way
this is maybe the most disturbing, it's in the rainwater, so that it's
detectable in rainwater just the same way that strontium-90 was detectable in
rainwater. So here's a case where we've got an industry that basically has a
legal framework that most of the other chemical companies, like tobacco,
pesticides, pharmaceutical companies, I mean, they would kill to have a legal
license such as is being enjoyed by the plastics industry. This is an example
of serious failure, and it would be a really interesting kind of a longer-term
research project if anybody's looking for a senior essay down the road to ask
the question, especially if you're interested in political science, why
wouldn&#39;t this industry be more heavily regulated than it is? How did they
escape control? How do they fly underneath the radar screen? </p>
<p>Again, I'm reminded
of Dustin Hoffman's film, <i>The Graduate</i>, where a middle-aged guy walks up
to Dustin Hoffman and pulls him aside at a party where Mrs. Robinson is
hovering around in the background next to the pool. And he walks up and he
says, &quot;I have one word for you, son. And it's plastics.&quot; Now this was
back in the mid-1960s. So that we've had this explosion of an industry that's
gotten into hundreds of thousands of different products. The chemicals, plastic
chemicals have gotten into the products, they've made their way into our life.
And most of us have recognized what's plastic and generally what's not. But we
really haven't thought about what it might mean for either our health or
environmental quality. </p>
<p>So I want to spend
just a couple of minutes having you think about the hormonal question that's
being raised by plastics. And this was first recognized by Rachel Carson when
she wrote <i>Silent Spring</i> back in 1962. And I've mentioned this on
occasions before, but not with respect to hormonally active compounds, where
she discovered along with colleagues that exposure to a variety of pesticides
that where hormonally active prevented calcium metabolism in eggshells. So that
it caused reproductive failure in certain species, especially large raptors.
Well that concept--that we need to worry about reproductive effects of some of
these chemicals--it really escaped much attention on the part of government
through the majority of the '60s and 1970s and then 1980s. </p>
<p>And then in 1996,
Theo Colburn, who also is a wildlife ecologist like Rachel Carson, wrote <i>Our
Stolen Future.</i> So if you're interested in this history, I would encourage
you to read <i>Our Stolen Future.</i> It's written as kind of a mystery story,
a scientific detective story they say in their subtitle. But she wrote this
with Diane Dumanowski, a longtime reporter with the <i>Boston Globe</i>, and
John Meyers, who also is a wildlife ecologist. If you want to follow this in
more detail, I recommend Ted Shettler's and Gina Solomon's book called <i>Generations
at Risk</i>. So thinking about how our fertility might be affected by these
chemicals, that we're experiencing mixtures without our knowledge, without our
consent. This is really the subject of most of these books. </p>
<p>So I want to look
more carefully at one of these compounds, bisphenol-A, because it's one that I
think almost everybody now has detectable levels of BPA in their tissues. And
it's now recognized to leach from containers. It's in soils and surface water
and fish. And it's highest in kids aged one to six. Now that's really pretty
curious. Why would it be highest in kids ages one to six? Experts inside EPA
and FDA now believe that food and beverages are the dominant sources of
exposure. By the way, there is yet no good answer to the question why the kids
are more heavily exposed. </p>
<p>The effects in
animals include female reproductive tract abnormalities, including
abnormalities in the ovary and abnormalities of the reproductive tract in older
female mice and changed vaginal morphology among post-pubertal offspring. And
it also influences the male reproductive system in different species, including
reduced sperm production, reduced mice testes weight and enhanced anogenital
distance. It also has been shown to induce mammary gland development in mice. </p>
<p>So thinking about
this chemical and thinking about the different decision making standards that
exist in different environmental laws that we've got, I'm curious about this in
that in bisphenol-A were being sold as a biocide, as a pesticide, the EPA could
not possibly license this chemical for use. The persistence of the chemical,
its environmental fate, its threat to health as evidenced by these studies
would be significant enough to prevent that from happening. It's also been
associated more recently with insulin resistance, raising questions about
diabetes. And also, there is some evidence of impaired immune function. Now
think about the fact that we're all being exposed to hormonally active
chemicals and mixtures without really understanding it. We don't really know
what the intensity of our exposure is. </p>
<p>So what are we seeing
out there in terms of fertility or diseases of reproduction in humans? Well,
we're seeing a rise in the prevalence of infertility, a serious rise over the
past several decades. And we're also seeing a rise in some negative effects in
humans, in males, particularly in young males, increase in hypospadias, which
means that the opening of the penis does not occur at the end of the penis, it
occurs further up the shaft. And also cryptorchidism, which means that little
kids don't have fully descended testicles when they're born. So that there are
a variety of different reproductive problems occurring in the population at
higher incidence than formerly. </p>
<p>Well, it's curious
when a debate like this occurs, when a product is out there on the marketplace,
it's treated globally, what do we do about it? Well, the government, the
regulatory agencies tend to call in experts and get expert opinions. So the
National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, convened a panel,
it turned out the panel was put together and some of the reading materials were
put together by some representatives of the industry itself so that many had a
view that this was not really an independent analysis of what the effects of
bisphenol-A might be. And they concluded with a phrase &quot;That there is some
concern that exposure to bisphenol-A causes some of these reproductive
problems.&quot; A second panel was convened of independent scientists that had
no connections to the plastics industry or the bisphenol-A industry at all. And
they concluded something quite different. &quot;The wide range of adverse
effects of low doses of BPA in laboratory animals exposed both during
development and adulthood is a source for concern with regard to the potential
for similar adverse effects in humans.&quot; </p>
<p>So that this idea
that you take a question of science and you raise it in front of a group of
experts really forces one to think carefully about what the conflicts of interest
might be for those experts. How could you put together a committee that clearly
was independent? Well, full disclosure is one way of doing that. So that
demanding the people disclose their income tax records or disclose their
affiliations or their consulting relationships with different industries could
clarify in the public's mind whether or not there is a high probability of a
bias. </p>
<p>Well, remember what I
said about bisphenol-A being the hardener, the phthalate, DEHP is a softener,
it's produced in a much lower volume, 260 million pounds per year. It's also
found in our bodies. It's added to PVC plastic. And its recycling percentage is
close to zero. And it also is widely found in the environment. And it's been
found with similar kinds of adverse effects in males, in test animals,
including reduced sperm production and early onset of puberty. </p>
<p>And all of this
exposure is coming predominately because of the failure of the Toxic Substance
Control Act. So Congress really recognized that we needed to test these
chemicals before they made their way into the market back in the early 1970s.
So they passed TSCA and gave the authority to EPA to demand pre-market testing.
But they didn't do anything about it. So again, the universe of chemicals is
big, 82,000 chemicals traded in commerce, they have some commercial value.
About 20,000 of those were added since 1986. And what that means is that this
statute, the way it's worded, it granted exemptions as chemicals that were
grandfathered or protected in the marketplace that couldn't be removed by EPA
to 62,000 different compounds. </p>
<p>The statute is
unusual also because it places a high burden on EPA to demonstrate that there
is a significant danger before it can demand from the industry that they
produce the evidence. Now, just pharmaceuticals and like pesticides and other
products that we've talked about, how much sense does it make to have the
industry producing the data themselves and then presenting their case to the
Environmental Protection Agency for licensing? Where should this occur? Should
there be some sort of an independent organization set up that would be more
protected from potential bias? Well clearly, there's an economic stake
involved, and industry is anxious to spend that money. But this high burden on
EPA to demonstrate danger is the primary reason for the failure of the Toxic
Substance Control Act. So that over this period of time, they have demanded
testing for only 200 different chemicals. And out of those 200, only five have
been prohibited. </p>
<p>So what are states
and other governmental agencies doing about this? Well, a variety of state
initiatives, including here in Connecticut, have been launched. And a number of
us have been involved in drafting legislation in different states. But here in
Connecticut, we now have a statute on the books as of last year that requires
that bisphenol-A be taken out of products that are intended to be used by young
children. And similar statutes have been passed in these other states. </p>
<p>You can think about
regulatory policy being of testing a chemical, figuring how dangerous it is and
then figuring out how you might regulate it. Or you might just say, here's a
clear threshold. If a chemical behaves in this way, say it's persistent, it's
bioaccumulative, it's found in human tissues, and it's demonstrated to be
hormonally active, that that's it. It's out of the marketplace. That's a
prohibitive policy. So once you decide not to employ a prohibitive policy, once
you decide not to ban, you basically require the regulatory agency to figure
out exactly which uses would be allowed and which would not. And it creates a
very expensive and difficult, time consuming monitoring and enforcement problem
for an agency. So the regulation--chemical by chemical, use by use--is not
likely to have much effect in solving a problem such as this. </p>
<p>California is
requiring a listing of DEHP under its Proposition 65. And this was required in
2008. And what it's done is, it's limited the concentration of DEHP in products
to less than 0.01 percent. Now what would that do? You're going to limit the
concentration of a chemical in a product to 0.012 percent. It's going to force
the government into becoming a monitoring organization. So it's got to go out
and it's got to test in order to find products that do not comply. Again, very
expensive, and a strategy that's not likely to work. </p>
<p>Now, the European
Union is taking a very different approach. They have adopted a law in 2006 known
as REACH. And REACH requires toxicity and environmental fate testing for 1,500
of the highest volume chemicals, the highest amount produced among the 80,000
chemicals that are out there that are poorly tested. It's also a program that's
been delayed. The endocrine screening program will not begin until 2012. The
mixture problem remains. They still are not going to tackle the issue that
we're exposed in mixtures that might act via the same mechanism. And also, they
will be grandfathering many of the chemicals that are produced in the smaller
quantities. </p>
<p>But why would it not
make sense to focus exclusively on the high-production volume chemicals? Well,
you've got to think about the fact that there could be some chemicals that are
extremely potent and extremely dangerous at very low doses. So plutonium again
is a good example of that. </p>
<p>Also, corporations
are acting on their own, so that PVC corporate phase-out policies have been
adopted by a variety of firms, including these. And this is having a very
significant effect. Number one, it's educating a lot of people. When they see a
label that says PVC free or BPA free, they start to pay attention and ask
questions, why that might be. </p>
<p>And I want you to
back up and I want you to think about really what the core of this problem is.
It really is consumerism, the fact that we buy much more than we need. We don't
pay attention in a way to the ingredients of different products that we bring
into our environment. It also has to do with the ignorance of our effects of
our own behavior. When I was preparing this lecture over the past couple of
days, I have to admit that I got really angry with myself. I got angry and I
got surprised, because I think of myself as somebody that should have known
better. I should have adjusted my lifestyle to what I recognize as a potential
threat, not just to the environment, not just to the population, but to my own
kids. So there are many reasons for that that don't have to do with me. But I
should have known better than that. And hopefully after taking this course, you
will not make this kind of problem yourself. </p>
<p>You can think about
national regulation as a partial solution because the markets are global.
People are trading these products and chemicals across national borders all the
time. So what does it mean if the United States passes a law, but say Germany
does not pass the law? Or Germany's got a more restrictive statute than the
United States? That's a recipe for trade barriers that are likely to be
eventually litigated. </p>
<p>So think also about
the concentration and dispersion of products and the effect of one corporation
like McDonald's or say Toyota to make a choice that they are going to not use
certain products. That they're not going to distribute a billion new toys over
the next two years with their new market line. Or that they're going to demand
ultimate accountability for the eventual fate or end of life of their product,
the way that some of the printer companies have that have demanded the
recycling, or not demanded, but offered to take back the ink cartridges once
they are empty. So basically, the government has been neglecting externalities
and there has been an absence of accountability. </p>
<p>So here is a list of
potential solutions. And I know we're out of time. Go through these. These will
be up on the website later this afternoon. So I'm going to conclude there and
just remind you that the electronic exam will be emailed out to you today at
five o'clock, that you have forty-eight hours to return it, and return it both
to the Classes*v2 server drop box, but also please return it to your teaching
assistants. </p>
<p>Thanks very much, and
good luck. And I probably won't see many of you before break, so I hope you
have a really great break.</p>
