<p><b>Professor Langdon Hammer</b>: On Monday I left off talking about
this--what shall we call it--exciting and dramatic ambivalence that one
finds in the early Eliot that expresses itself in his relationship to
literary tradition; where on the one hand, he presents himself as a
truly subversive and aggressive entrant into literary tradition,
someone who's really going to shake it up and transform it; and on the
other hand, as someone who is a traditionalist, who is going to speak
with deference and seek – the word he uses is "conformity"--with the
past. Somehow, both these things are going on at the same time and in
relationship to each other. And "Prufrock" itself is a poem, I think,
preoccupied with this kind of ambivalence that I'm describing. On the
one hand, it is a poem that introduces us to a speaker who lacks will
and who seems timorous and timid and who hesitates before action. On
the other hand, he is a speaker who says to us, "There will be time to
murder and create," as if creating and murdering were, in fact, in some
relation and might go on at the same time. And in fact, if one does
have some sense of creativity as involving a kind of aggression, or
even murderousness, one might hesitate before it, right?</p>

<p>These psychological dimensions that I'm describing have, well,
Freudian and Oedipal dimensions that I think are readily apparent. How
is it possible for Eliot to claim the authority of past literature
without, at the same time, either destroying it or utterly submitting
himself to it? This problem expresses, I think, Eliot's double relation
to the past and is expressed, as I was suggesting last time, in the
ambiguous use of quotation that seems to hover between some kind of
deferential honoring of the literature of the past and something much
more provocative and often parodic.</p>

<p>And you can think of the many different texts that "Prufrock"
alludes to and borrows, only some of which are traced in your
footnotes. In fact, there's a great many more than you find in your
footnotes. There are quotations from Marvell, from the Bible, from
Dante, from <i>Twelfth Night</i>. Well, there's that opening quotation
from Dante, from the Gospels, too. Prufrock's world-weariness, you
know, "For I have known them all already, known them all," as
understood in the poetic context, this seems to, well, express his
sense of belatedness and of the--everything having in some sense been
done already. In, again, Freudian or Oedipal terms, terms that Harold
Bloom would develop as a reader of Eliot in his own criticism very
influentially, you can put the problem this way: how can Eliot come to
write in the father's place without killing him or being overwhelmed by
him? In his confrontation with the past, neither he, Eliot, nor the
past must be destroyed, or the game's over. Eliot thereby swerves, you
could say, alternatively from each of these unacceptable alternatives.
And that kind of back-and-forth-ness you feel in Prufrock's divagations
and wanderings. You see it throughout Eliot's early career in his funny
mixture of avant-gardism and traditionalism because he's both those
things.</p>

<p>I've been describing this in psychological terms. We could also
think about it in social terms, and I think it's important to do so.
This Oedipal drama that I'm describing is also a social drama in
important ways. Here is a question: how does a young American – because
that's what he was – go and win a place in English literary culture,
insert himself in a tradition that includes Shakespeare, Milton,
Tennyson, and Wordsworth; insert himself not only as a member of that
tradition but as a central explainer of it and tastemaker, which is in
fact what Eliot would become?</p>

<p>Last time I pointed out that Eliot's expatriation, his going from
the U.S. to London, was a rejection not only of America and
American-ness, but in particular a rejection of his father, who died
while he was abroad; and there was a certain amount of question about
whether Eliot would return in time to see his father before he died. In
a very short time in London, Eliot becomes more English than the
English. It's a strange and marvelous, fascinating development. He
learns or creates a certain style of English-ness that he then goes on
to teach to the English themselves. This is what Williams – William
Carlos Williams – and, in fact, other American writers despised about
Eliot, that he was the--not just the Anglophile that he was, but the
true English authority that he became. He made himself, without any
previous standing, any connections really in London or in English
culture--he made himself a central cultural authority, which became in
a very short time almost synonymous with tradition itself. This is an
amazing and remarkable achievement and an important cultural event.</p>

<p>The thing is that the tradition that Eliot expounded was something
to a large degree he invented. Eliot is not, as he is often seen, I
think, the defender of a social order that was passing away. And
sometimes Yeats represents himself that way. Rather, Eliot is the
representative of a new class, a new class opposing itself to the
traditional social authority of money and of blood, aristocracy, that
makes its claim for social authority on the basis of knowledge,
technical knowledge and expertise above all: a kind of professional
class into which you, too, are being educated largely through the
modern university. Eliot's tradition, that I'm saying he invented or
created, described, defined--he made it out of the education he had
received at Harvard. And he also, importantly, made it outside of the
classroom, in part in the school of Ezra Pound who, you might remember
from last week, specifically also when he expatriates, leaves behind
the <i>vulgo</i>, the people, and sees himself as entering into some
kind of timeless tradition that he identifies – Pound does – with the
"spirits of irony and destiny." That's his phrase to describe the great
writers of the past.</p>

<p>Eliot also enters this kind of semi-imaginary community of
tradition. Eliot's sense of tradition is established in part through
his quotations and allusions in his poetry, in part and importantly,
and I'll talk more about it today, through his criticism. This kind of
tradition with which Eliot allies himself, you could say bankrolls
everything he does, legitimizes and authorizes, gives sanction and
precedent to what was Eliot's strange new poetry. Frost, you remember,
as he says, "goes to market" so he could stand on his own two feet.
Well, Eliot went to tradition to establish his autonomy. And tradition
allows him to, well, to stand apart both from the genteel audiences
that Pound resisted, that Frost in certain ways courted, and also
allows Eliot to stand apart from the avant-garde, which he has a kind
of ambiguous relationship to; allows him to stand apart, you could say,
from the audiences of both a magazine like <i>The Atlantic</i> or
<i>Harper's</i> on the one hand, and on the other hand a magazine like
the <i>Little Review</i> or <i>Blast</i> even, where he did appear, or
<i>Broom</i> --some of those magazines I showed you in the first week.
Eliot's own magazine, which becomes an important vehicle for his work
and his ideas and his authority and his presence in literary
culture--and you can go back and look at its cover in the images for
the first week. His magazine was <i>The Criterion</i>, a magazine that
had a kind of semi-official look and represents the fantasy of, I
think, a kind of institutional and universal authority.</p>

<p>Well, how do you go about inventing tradition? In order to do so,
Eliot had to demonstrate that the received existing tradition was a
false one. "The Metaphysical Poets" is the great and peculiar, in many
ways, essay, in which Eliot undertakes this work in a very influential
form. And I'd like to look at it with you for a few minutes. It starts
on page 950 at the back of your book and goes to page 953. This was a
book review. This was one of the great book reviews in the history of
English criticism. Eliot was reviewing an anthology of the metaphysical
poets. That is, poets of wit, in particular of the--largely of the
seventeenth century, including poets like Donne, whose reputation Eliot
did a great deal to establish in this century. In the process of
reviewing this anthology, Eliot comes up with a whole alternative
theory or alternative history of English literature and certain key
poetic propositions and statements. Let me just emphasize a few of them
for you. You'll see how the account of literary history and Eliot's own
ideas of poetics are all kind of mixed up. And so you have to consider
them together.</p>

<p>On page 951, he has just quoted Donne, and then he's quoted
Tennyson. And the idea is that Donne is good, Tennyson is bad. Now, he
will continue and say:</p>

<blockquote>The difference is not a simple difference of degree between
poets. It is something which had happened to the mind of England
between the time of Dunn or Lord Herbert of Cherbury and the time of
Tennyson and Browning; it is the difference between the intellectual
poet [that's a good kind of poet] and the reflective poet [bad].
Tennyson and Browning are poets, and they think; but they do not feel
their thought as immediately as the odour of a rose. A thought to Donne
was an experience; it modified his sensibility. [Evidently, he felt his
thought as immediately, as sensually, as the odor of a rose.] When a
poet's mind is perfectly equipped for its work, it is constantly
amalgamating disparate experience; the ordinary man's experience is
chaotic, irregular, fragmentary. [Maybe quite a bit like Prufrock's,
you would think.] The latter falls in love, or reads Spinoza, and these
two experiences have nothing to do with each other, or with the noise
of the typewriter or the smell of cooking; in the mind of the poet,
however, these experiences are constantly forming new
wholes.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Well, you can see there a little recipe for an Auden poem, excuse me
– well, maybe for an Auden poem too – for an Eliot poem. It's a poem
about falling in love, reading Spinoza and listening to the typewriter
while somebody cooks something.</p>

<blockquote>We may express the differences by the following theory [And
note that "we": you know, Eliot has this "we" that you just have to bow
before when he uses it, or join him, I guess]: The poets of the
seventeenth century, the successors of the dramatists of the sixteenth,
possessed a mechanism of sensibility, which could devour [and that's an
interesting word] any kind of experience. They are simple, artificial,
difficult, or fantastic, as their predecessors were; no less nor more
than Dante…. In the seventeenth century [however] a dissociation of
sensibility set in, from which we have never recovered [And this--what
does he mean? He means thought and feeling have somehow come apart];
and this dissociation, as is natural, was aggravated by the influence
of the two most powerful poets of the century, Milton and
Dryden.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And then he goes on to complain about Milton and Dryden and then
follow the Romantic inheritance of Milton and Dryden in the next
paragraph. He says:</p>

<blockquote>The sentimental age began early in the eighteenth century,
and continued. [Wouldn't you like, in your own essays, to be able to
give this kind of rapid-fire summary of literary history?] The poets
revolted against the ratiocinative, the descriptive; they thought and
felt by fits, unbalanced; they reflected. In one or two passages of
Shelley's <i>Triumph of Life</i>, in the second <i>Hyperion</i> [of
Keats] there are traces of a struggle toward unification of
sensibility. But Keats and Shelley died, and Tennyson and Browning
ruminated.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It's amazing literary criticism. Well, here is quite an
extraordinary account of English literary history. Eliot is proposing
this. It's quite a strange and interesting claim, which for a long
time, I might add, really was persuasive and became a kind of orthodoxy
among readers of English poetry. And that is: that the metaphysical
poets, for centuries viewed as an anomaly in the history of English
poetry because of their extreme intellectuality, their poetry of wit,
that this anomaly in English literary tradition actually represents
central values in literature that were lost through what Eliot views as
an eccentric and aberrant tradition, which is, in fact, that which
descends from Milton and runs through the Romantics and Victorians.</p>

<p>Samuel Johnson in the eighteenth century influentially complained of
the metaphysical poets that they "yoked the most heterogeneous ideas
together by violence" – this is Johnson's phrase. In other words, they
were forced and willful and they put things together in a kind of
violent and artificial way. Eliot is flipping that around. And he says,
only the metaphysical poets united thought and feeling. And it's these
other poets that have been deficient and marginal to the main mission
of English poetry, and that they are symptomatic of some derangement in
the mind of England that he calls a "dissociation of sensibility,"
which somehow set in in the seventeenth century or so.</p>

<p>All of this, this whole sort of account of how English history,
English literary history, developed – all of this in this essay
suddenly, without any preparation, turns into a defense of modern
poetry, or you might say a defense of Eliot's poetry. He says, without,
as I say, really any preparation on the bottom of page 952:</p>

<blockquote>It is not a permanent necessity that poets should be
interested in philosophy [as I was, or as I am], or in any other
subject. We [and there's that "we" again] can only say that it appears
likely that poets in our civilization, as it exists at present, must be
<i>difficult</i>. Our civilization [he continues] comprehends great
variety and complexity, and this variety and complexity, playing upon a
refined sensibility [such as mine], must produce various and complex
results. The poet [and now he's telling us what poets must do] must
become more and more comprehensive, more allusive, more indirect, in
order to force, to dislocate if necessary, language into his
meaning.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And then he will go on to quote French poetry, modern French poetry,
to demonstrate, as he feels it, the continuity between modern verse and
the metaphysicals.</p>

<p>Well, here, Eliot is saying, first of all, that the character of
modern poetry--and again, for which we must read, his poetry--is simply
a reflection of the forces playing upon it, the variety and complexity
of our civilization. In that formulation, the poet seems almost
passive, doesn't he? Passive and like a kind of receptor that is
naturally and necessarily producing the kind of strange poetry that
Eliot writes. Then, before that idea has really sunk in, Eliot gives us
another view of what the poet is doing. The poet is not in fact
passive, but rather, he is forcing, he is dislocating language into his
meaning. And it's such an odd phrase, to "dislocate language" into your
meaning. It suggests that the poet is not merely producing language,
but moving it from one place to another.</p>

<p>The question that we might ask, though, standing back, of the
metaphysicals is a question that we could ask of Eliot's poetry. That
is, does this poetry that Eliot's talking about put things together or
take them apart? Does it represent some kind of synthesis, or rather,
some kind of violent derangement? Is it a mirror of a various and
complex civilization? Is it in that sense mimetic, realist? Or is it
rather expressionistic, willful, a kind of subjective and highly
personal expression in which the poet is purposefully, actively
dislocating and deforming language? Is it in this sense a poetry that
is a kind of necessary and inevitable expression of the age? Or is it
perverse and eccentric: an arbitrary assertion of authorial will? These
are questions that Eliot's own work, as I say, raises and that are part
of the history of his reception. Eliot, in his account of the
metaphysicals and then in his defense of his own kind of poetry, seems,
I think, to equivocate to a degree between these alternatives.
Equivocation is, again, the key rhetoric of "Prufrock" and of Eliot's
early poetry, of Prufrock's temporizing and his delays and his going
back and forth.</p>

<p>Let me say just a couple more things about "Prufrock" in the light
of what I've just been quoting for you from "The Metaphysical Poets."
"Prufrock" has a kind of ambiguous relation to the past, and
specifically to the past of English Romanticism. The poem is
simultaneously a deconstruction and critique of the Romantic ideals and
values of originality, of expressiveness, and it is also a highly
original and expressive reworking of those ideals. It's a kind of
anti-Romantic poem that is an extension of Romanticism. Unlike the
conventional love song, this one comes from the head rather than the
heart or, you could say, really from that opening quotation from Dante
on, it comes from, comes out of many other texts.</p>

<p>I think that there's a kind of suggestion or implication in the poem
that what people claim is original and primary is always in some sense
already scripted. That consciousness, the way our minds work, is
linguistic: that we think and feel through language, with language, and
through a kind of collage network of verbal associations made out of
texts and phrases from not only literary tradition, of course, but the
whole spectrum of everyday life. Original speech, heroic action, the
will, unmediated desire: these ideals are all rejected in "Prufrock";
parodied; subjected to irony, discontinuity. They're seen as Romantic
illusions, clichés.</p>

<p>The poem is not merely a parody of them; or, maybe through parody it
does something else. It is, of course, in its own way, quite as daring
and disturbing a poem, disturbing to the universe of poetry at least,
as any modern poem. And I think you can see it as, in effect, a new
kind of love song, one in which the withdrawing of desire from an
object – our consciousness of our own desires – subjects them to
reflection but at the same time sustains them and re-voices them
through reflection. You could say that what the poem does is to
intellectualize longing. And, behind that, it makes of the modern
skeptic and intellectual a new kind of Romantic hero. What does
Prufrock want, ultimately? What does he mean when he says, "No, that's
not what I meant at all?" Well, it's hard to say exactly. But the poem
does conclude, and as it does it gives us a kind of answer, I think.
Why don't we look at the end of it? That's on page 466.</p>

<blockquote>I grow old. . . I grow old. . .<br />
 I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.<br />
<br />
Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?<br />
 I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.<br />
 I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
You see, here, Prufrock has moved into these rhyming tercets. He says
quite simply and definitively:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>I do not think that they will sing to me.<br />
<br />
I have seen them riding seaward on the waves<br />
 Combing the white hair of the waves blown back<br />
 When the wind blows the water white and black.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And as he describes this, there is kind of heightening of
conventional lyric language with that alliteration and with those
images:</p>

<blockquote>We have lingered in the chambers of the sea<br />
 By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown<br />
 Till human voices wake us, and we drown.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It's hard to interpret, I think, the end of this poem precisely. I
think that Prufrock has really no clarified, no specified desire,
except maybe to hear the mermaids. "I do not think that they will sing
to me": "I want them to," he seems to be saying. In a sense, I think,
you could say he wants Romantic singing. He wants to hear it. Perhaps
he wants to be able to join in it himself, which is a wish for lyric
inspiration, isn't it? He doesn't want to make love to these mermaids.
He wants to hear them. He wants to linger with them, to have access to
their element, and to that extent to be among them and even like them.
It is a wish for, specifically, freedom from human voices, which I take
to be the endless, overheard inner voices in which the quoted,
repetitive speech that makes up his consciousness consists. In this
sense, it's a wish for a renewal of Romantic enchantment, which he
knows is impossible, and which he also knows, I think, is a wish as old
as Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale." And this is a poem, ultimately, very
much in that Keatsian tradition.</p>

<p><i>The Waste Land</i>: let's begin at the end. Let's begin at the
end, on page 486. <i>The Waste Land</i> is a poem that comes in five
parts. The fifth section, I think, it's the longest, is called "What
the Thunder Said." It reaches a kind of climax when the poem renders
the voice of the thunder. In the landscape of <i>The Waste Land</i>, we
are waiting for water. We're waiting for everything that water would
represent. And thunder promises that water, and it also, importantly,
represents a kind of speech: a speech that comes out of nature,
something that the thunder says, has all kinds of mythological
resonance. You might even view it as the voice of myth itself, here
able to be given a voice and a hearing in the poem. What the thunder
says, is "Da." Da: a primary syllable. There is a note explaining this,
coming to us from your editor and from Eliot. It is the first phoneme
that becomes part of the instruction, the series of instructions
"<i>Datta</i>," "<i>Dayadhvam</i>," "<i>Damyata</i>," translated as
"Give," "Sympathize," "Control." When the thunder speaks, this is what
it has to say. It gives us these instructions. On page 486, I'll just
focus on one of these imperatives:</p>

<blockquote>Da<br />
 <i>Dayadhvam</i>: I have heard the key<br />
 Turn in the door once and turn once only<br />
 We think of the key, each in his prison<br />
 Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison<br />
 Only at nightfall, aethereal rumours<br />
 Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus<br />
 Da<br />
 <i>Damyata</i>: The boat responded<br />
 Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar<br />
 The sea was calm, your heart [and there's this interesting switch
of<br />
 tense] would have responded<br />
 Gaily, when invited, beating obedient<br />
 To controlling hands</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Well, "<i>Dayadhvam</i>" is translated here as "sympathize." The
poem is, in many ways, concerned with sympathy as a central value, a
central action in human life, and the lines that they introduce
describe the condition that sympathy would redress or enter into in
some kind of healing way. "I have heard the key / turn in the door once
and turn once only." Well, Eliot, when he produced this poem – not the
first version of this poem in <i>The Criterion</i>, his own magazine
where it first was published, but rather when it appeared in the United
States – added footnotes, or rather endnotes, to the poem. And the
endnotes we have here are worth contemplating. In a sense, Eliot's
notes are a kind of extension of the poem, part of the poem. These
lines bear the note "four":</p>

<blockquote>"And below I heard them nailing shut the door / of the
horrible tower." [The speaker of those lines that Eliot is alluding to,
half-quoting, is Dante's Count Ugolino in the thirty-third canto of
<i>The Inferno</i>.] The traitor Ugolino tells Dante that his enemies
imprisoned him and his children in a tower to die of
starvation.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And of course, Ugolino would eat his children. Eliot continues. He
gives us that little fragment from Dante, and then he says:</p>

<blockquote>"Also, F.H. Bradley, <i>Appearance and Reality</i>, p. 346.
[When he writes like that, it's like wearing that waistcoat. It's a
kind of pose, in this case the pose of a scholar-pedant. Bradley says:]
'My external sensations are no less private to myself than are my
thoughts or my feelings. In either case my experience falls within my
own circle, a circle closed on the outside; and, with all its elements
alike, every sphere is opaque to the others which surround it.... In
brief, regarded as an existence which appears in a soul, the whole
world for each is peculiar and private to that soul.'"</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Eliot worked on Bradley for his thesis. "The whole world for each is
peculiar and private to that soul." Well, I don't know that there is
any key to <i>The Waste Land</i>, but if there is a key to <i>The Waste
Land</i>, it's this key in these lines, which lead us to Bradley and
Bradley's view of what consciousness is like. Consciousness is a
condition in which we are locked into our own, I think, linguistic
representations of reality without a common language to share them. How
can a common world be created out of radically private experience?
Well, this is, I think, the central question that <i>The Waste Land</i>
is meditating on, responding to. It's one of the central questions in
modern poetry.</p>

<p>We won't get too far in the poem today. We'll have to conclude our
discussion on Monday, but let's look at the beginning together simply
to recall how this poetry operates and make some preliminary
observations. This section, the first section, is called "The Burial of
the Dead" and refers to the ritual in the Anglican Church as described
in the <i>Book of Common Prayer.</i></p>

<blockquote>April is the cruelest month, breeding<br />
 Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing<br />
 Memory and desire, stirring<br />
 Dull roots with spring rain.<br />
 Winter kept us warm, covering<br />
 Earth in forgetful snow, feeding<br />
 A little life with dried tubers.<br />
 Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee<br />
 With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,<br />
 And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,<br />
 And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.<br />
 Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.<br />
 And when we were children, staying at the arch-duke's,<br />
 My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,<br />
 And I was frightened. He said, Marie,<br />
 Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.<br />
 In the mountains, there you feel free.<br />
 I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It's extraordinary poetry. And one of the ways in which it is
extraordinary is the modulations, and where do we pinpoint the turning
points between the initial, vatic, general voice of the poem and then
that extremely personalized first person, who will be Marie, named that
way through that memory. How do we get from "April is the cruelest
month" to "I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter"?
Somehow there is a variety, I think, a range of voices here. And how
Eliot moves from the one to the other is a question for us as readers.
I think it also raises, again, this central problem that the poem is
concerned with. And that is, what is the relationship, how do we
articulate the relationship between the general and the particular,
between experience that is generalizable and that which is almost
irreducibly private?</p>

<p>"April is the cruelest month": those wonderful lines we all know.
Well, the poem begins with allusion, which it hardly even needs to
press to "Whan that Aprill, with his shoures soote," the first line of
<i>The Canterbury Tales</i>. It evokes too, probably, Whitman's "When
Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed," another April elegy. The poem
begins by talking about the pain of awakened desire, begins talking
about the risk that comes with beginning and desiring –
<i>Prufrock</i>'s themes. Here they are, writ large. Desire, it seems,
is painful because it breaks things open that are closed and shut. It's
also, it seems, unsatisfiable. All of these are, to a degree,
conventional Romantic <i>topoi</i>, motifs.</p>

<p>Where exactly does the poem modulate into personal memory? Well,
maybe somewhere in that eighth line, "Summer surprised us. . ." It
started out looking and feeling a lot like "Winter kept us warm," but
now the memory will become highly particularized through quotation,
incidentally as your note will explain. The poem really moves into a
kind of opaque set of personal associations: "…when we were children,
staying at the arch-duke's," and so on; "…he took me out on a sled."
These associations are meaningful and resonant and representative, I
think, to the extent that they have a generic quality. That is, it's
not so much that they are our memories, but they're like memories.
They're like personal memories, and they're like personal memories in
the difficulty of translating and sharing them. Marie has a kind of
exemplary privacy about her and her memories and her sense of
frustrated desire and longing.</p>

<p>There is more that's important about this first of <i>The Waste
Land</i>'s speakers. Well, "Bin gar keine Russin" is translated for us
down below as, "I'm not a Russian woman at all; I come from Lithuania,
[therefore] a true German." Whoever is saying that exactly, whether
it's Marie or someone else, seems to be speaking of a kind of hybrid
identity, a kind of mongrel or deracinated identity. The condition of
locked-in sensibility and difficult private emotion is, from the very
beginning of the poem, associated with metropolitan culture, a culture
where there are many languages, speakers from many places. And, well, a
culture where there are, as it were, a kind of cacophony of languages
untranslated, existing and competing side-by-side. This is a kind of
linguistic environment that <i>The Waste Land</i> is made out of and is
also in many ways about and is the real medium of experience in the
poem.</p>

<p>Well, let me stop here. And we'll go on trying to make sense of this
great modern poem on Monday.</p>
