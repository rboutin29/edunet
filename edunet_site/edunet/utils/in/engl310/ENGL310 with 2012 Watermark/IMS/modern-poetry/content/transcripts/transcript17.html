<p><b>Professor Langdon Hammer</b>: I was wanting to carry over more
Williams today. Poor Williams, he only got a day, like Langston Hughes,
but it's hard to give everybody their day. And I think on reflection
I'd rather give two full lectures to Marianne Moore because first of
all, she's a difficult poet. "Oh good," you're saying, "as opposed to
all these other people." She's difficult in a different way, and in
some ways she doesn't seem difficult, as you get started, but she's
idiosyncratic and I'd like to give her a chance to get your attention
and give you a chance to learn how to read her.</p>

<p>It also strikes me that we haven't read a lot of women poets in this
course, have we? We've read H.D., but that's really about it so far.
The giants of modern poetry, they're men: Yeats, Eliot and company.
Moore has a claim to stature like theirs. I think she is a remarkable
poet, and one who interestingly, I think, has had as much or perhaps
even more practical influence and effect over the development of poetry
since modernism, as much or more than any of the poets we've been
reading. The general question of the position of women and of women
poets in modern poetry is interesting and important, and an important
context for thinking about Moore. Women in the modernist literary
culture that we've been studying are identified very frequently with
popular and gentile forms of writing and taste; think about Hart Crane
complaining to Harriet Monroe, the editor of <i>Poetry</i> magazine, as
if she's just too square to get it. This is not an unusual attitude.
Women are associated to a degree with political writing of the period,
certain kinds of experimental writing, and also above all with the
legacy of the nineteenth-century poetess. James Joyce said <i>The Waste
Land</i> "ended the idea of poetry for ladies"; this is its
achievement. Poor ladies!</p>

<p>Well, you maybe get the idea in Joyce's comment that here was a poem
that broke with a nineteenth-century culture of poetry that was in
certain ways feminized, at least as imagined here by Joyce and
certainly by other modern poets. At the same time you can think about
the very rich and complicated role of women in <i>The Waste Land</i> in
order to get some sense of the complexity of the position of women in
modern poetry in general. Think of the ways in which Eliot as a poet
draws on female speakers and female voices and, you might say, even
aspires to sound like Isolde or Philomel or, well, one of his own
inventions in "The Fire Sermon." In general, you could say that the
modern poets we've been reading aggressively and self-consciously
masculinize poetry, in particular by trying to disassociate poetry from
what is commercial, polite, soft, dreamy, ideal, leisured – all
qualities and attitudes gendered in their imagination – and instead
connect poetry to what is technically rigorous, advanced, learned,
unsentimental, hard, and often hard work: terms that are, again,
clearly gendered. H.D. in her own distinctive way is also doing this,
taking part in this.</p>

<p>Modern poetry wanted to make poetry culturally central and powerful,
to reposition it, to achieve for it the power to define and describe
culture. And this was very often, as I'm suggesting, played out in very
gendered terms, trying to claim for poetry a set of capacities that
were strongly gendered in these poets' imaginations. At the same time
this desire, as I'm saying, is conflicted and complicated, and we need
only think of Eliot's case, but you could look back to Yeats's
relationship to women speakers, his own complicated set of
identifications with them, and so on.</p>

<p>How does Marianne Moore fit in this? What did it mean for her to be
a modern poet and a woman? These are questions that I'll take up today,
first of all addressing this question specifically of, well, what did
it mean to write from the position of a woman, for Moore? And then I
want to go on and talk about Moore as an American poet, which she was
self-consciously, and then to begin to talk about Moore as a nature
poet, which she also was.</p>

<p>Let's get started by looking at one of her earliest publications, a
poem that like many of the other important early poems by these poets
appeared in <i>Poetry</i> magazine, this time I think in 1919; I'm not
sure, I'll check the date. I'm talking about the poem called "A Grave"
on page 440.</p>

<blockquote>Man looking into the sea,<br />
 taking the view from those who have as much right to it as you have
to<br />
 yourself,<br />
 it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing,<br />
 but you cannot stand in the middle of this;<br />
 the sea has nothing to give but a well excavated grave.<br />
 The firs stand in a procession, each with an emerald turkey-foot at
the<br />
 top,<br />
 reserved as their contours, saying nothing;<br />
 repression, however, is not the most obvious characteristic of the
sea;<br />
 the sea is a collector, quick to return a rapacious look.<br />
 There are others besides you have worn that look--<br />
 whose expression is no longer a protest; the fish no longer
investigate<br />
 them<br />
 for their bones have not lasted:<br />
 men lower nets, unconscious of the fact that they are desecrating
a<br />
 grave,<br />
 and row quickly away--the blades of the oars<br />
 moving together like the feet of water-spiders as if there were no
such<br />
 thing as death.<br />
 The wrinkles progress among themselves in a phalanx--beautiful
under<br />
 networks of foam,<br />
 and fade breathlessly while the sea rustles in and out of the
seaweed;<br />
 the birds swim through the air at top speed, emitting cat-calls
as<br />
 heretofore--<br />
 the tortoise-shell scourges about the feet of the cliffs, in motion
beneath<br />
 them;<br />
 and the ocean, under the pulsation of lighthouses and noise of
bell-<br />
 buoys,<br />
 advances as usual, looking as if it were not that ocean in which
dropped<br />
 things are bound to sink--<br />
 in which if they turn and twist, it is neither with volition nor<br />
 consciousness.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It's a great poem and it's a poem that announces a speaker that
sounds like no one else, and sounds like certainly no one we have been
reading. Think about "The Seafarer," another poem about the sea. How
did that sound? "Bitter breast-cares have I abided, nigh on the
night-watch." You remember Pound's sonorous and even perhaps ponderous,
heroic Anglo-Saxon alliterative meter, which I talked about as, in
Pound's case, a deliberate and interesting evasion of iambic pentameter
norms – blank verse as a kind of model for heroic speech. Well, so is
this, but it sounds nothing like that. It's on the other end of the
spectrum, right? It sounds like what? Prose, in certain ways; a
remarkable, elevated prose, but prose, prose that uses words like
"consciousness" or "volition," "however." When was the last time you
saw a poem that said "however"? It really announces a speaker who is
using a kind of expository language. There are Latinate words. There's
obviously no meter and rhyme.</p>

<p>At the same time there is a developed and, as almost always in
Moore, intricate formal design, an idiosyncratic formal design that is
operating in the poem, but almost secretly. What's it look like on the
page? A lot of long lines, right? A lot of long lines, some of which
run over. Well, this, like other Moore poems, is a poem structured
around counting syllables per line and counting, in fact, numbers of
lines. This is not a kind of formal organization that you hear, and
it's even difficult to see, but it's an operative one for her and it's
one of the ways in which she organizes her verse. It's as if Moore has
in some sense set up her own rules, clung to them, and kept them
secret. She doesn't always keep them secret; sometimes they're quite
conspicuous and even flashy in certain poems in their designs. But here
it's quite inconspicuous.</p>

<p>What you have is a poem that is made up of two eleven-line groups,
two eleven-line stanzas or paragraphs, each beginning with a short
seven-syllable line: "Man looking into the sea," "for their bones have
not lasted." This is the pattern that structures the poem. In all these
ways that I'm describing – the syllable count, the expository writing,
the Latinate diction, the self-conscious, prose-like nature of the
language, all those semi-colons – this is poetry that has distanced
itself from traditions of song, and certainly from nineteenth-century
traditions of versification. The form of the poem is, again, not
something you see or even hear necessarily. It's there almost as a kind
of absence.</p>

<p>Now, there's also, wonderfully, a certain combativeness. Moore is a
combative and pugnacious poet. You, again, may not see this immediately
because of the poem's impersonality, the way in which it seems to
present itself and the often intricate forms of syntax or oblique
approach. But she is a fighter, and this poem is really a kind of
fighting that we're seeing. The poem begins in irritation. It begins as
a complaint – a complaint that's addressed to whom? To man; "Man
looking into the sea." "Man" suggests, well, maybe humankind. You think
about the people on the shore in Frost's poem, "Neither Out Far Nor In
Deep," who are standing there looking out at the water.</p>

<p>Well, Moore might be addressing them. But I think there's a more
specific and particular "man" that is the irritant that sets the poem
going: a man, the figure of a man who, like a romantic poet, has
arrogated to himself the position to take in the view, to stand like
the figure in a Caspar David Friedrich painting and gaze into the
sublime. Meanwhile, Moore is somewhere else. Where is she? She's
somewhere behind him, because he's blocked her view: "Man looking into
the sea, / taking the view from those who have as much right to it as
you have to yourself." Well, "it is human nature to stand in the middle
of a thing," she says, trying to make sense of this. Moore has a couple
of comments here that describe the origins of this poem. It's the first
quotation on your handout. She says:</p>

<blockquote>As for "A Grave," it has a significance apart from the
literal origin [but here is the literal origin], which was a man who
placed himself between my mother and me, and the surf we were watching
from the middle ledge of rocks on Monhegan Island after the storm.
("Don't be annoyed," my mother said. "It is human nature to stand in
the middle of a thing.")</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It is important that, however, Moore was annoyed. She was annoyed
into poetry, you could say, and she took her mother with her. The poem
is really written from the perspective of a daughter and mother, and a
daughter with an intimate relationship to her mother who absorbs, here
and very often elsewhere in her poetry, actual quotations from but even
more importantly a style of speech and attitude associated with her
mother, who talks a lot like Dr. Samuel Johnson or some other
eighteenth-century figure and moralist like that. Mrs. Moore is someone
whom Marianne always identified with herself. It's significant here
that Moore is using a quotation from her mother and not acknowledging
it in any particular way, as if the two women had one voice and one
perspective.</p>

<p>The man who blocks their point of view, and blocks their point of
view, you could say, in many senses – their literal point of view of
the water – but also the point of view he takes in effect ignores and
suppresses theirs. He is standing in the posture, as I suggest, of a
kind of conventional, romantic visionary staring into the sea, emblem
of infinity. Well, it might be Hart Crane writing "At Melville's Tomb,"
although Crane wouldn't write that poem for a few more years; and when
he did, incidentally, he sent it to Marianne Moore, who was then the
editor of <i>The Dial</i>, who sent it back and rejected it. Moore's
poem is, in fact, as I suggested, an early poem of hers and an early
act of self-definition that's quite important in both the impersonality
of the point of view and yet the insistent individuality of that point
of view. Moore's poems are like this. They seem impersonal and yet
they're at the same time deeply personal and deeply individual.</p>

<p>Here she celebrates the power of the sea to resist the imposition of
the observer's will, or the will of the sailor or seafarer; you can
even think of Odysseus or Pound's seafarer. The sea is "a collector,
quick to return a rapacious look": i.e. if you want to take possession
of the sea in some way, well, don't think you can do that because this
is a grander force than you and it will take you up and drown you,
which is what the poem goes on to describe. The sea has here the force
that it does in other great poems by Moore like "The Fish" or "Sojourn
in the Whale." It seems to stand for death. It is a grave; it is a
grave in which you could say a certain idea of romantic and, I think,
specifically male subjectivity is overcome and buried, shown its
limits. In this poem the human, imagined finally as something that
twists and turns in the depths, is converted by natural forces into a
part of the natural world that it sought through the man's perspective
to dominate.</p>

<p>Moore sent this poem to Pound. These poets are always sending their
poems to Pound. He responded with admiration in that second quotation
there, and he says: "Thank God, [even though you are a woman] I think
you can be trusted not to pour out a flood (in the manner of dear Amy
[Lowell] and [Edgar Lee] Masters)," who though not a woman was a
sentimental regionalist and not an international modernist. Pound is
approving of Moore here. He approves that she does not gush, she does
not emote. She has not written a sentimental poem. In fact, in certain
ways she's written an anti-sentimental poem. I think it's important
that Moore's rhetorical choices have prevented her from doing so, that
the poem has the kind of formal self-discipline it does. Again, these
are aspects of restraint in the poetry. Moore is dry in all respects.
At the same time, these are modernist values, values that Pound would
describe in his Imagist manifesto and elsewhere. At the same time,
Moore gets her dryness not by disavowing femininity or suppressing it
or attacking it, as one of her peers might have. She does it, rather,
specifically in this act of challenging "man."</p>

<p>Let me look with you at the letter that Moore wrote to Pound in
response that acts as a kind of, now, letter of introduction. And it
has a lot of interesting things in it and it's probably a good
introduction to who she is for us, too. She says:</p>

<blockquote>I was born in 1887 and brought up in the home of my
grandfather, a clergyman of the Presbyterian church. [She comes from a
Christian and God-fearing home.] I am Irish by descent [and that's
where some of the combativeness comes from], possibly Scotch also, but
purely Celtic, was graduated from Bryn Mawr [where she knew and
befriended H.D.]… and taught shorthand, typewriting…. [She's worked for
a living.] In 1916 my mother [Mary Warner Moore] and I left home in
Carlisle to be with… [her brother, a] Chaplain of the battleship Rhode
Island…. [There's a lot of Christianity in the family. She says that
she's living with her mother in New York, and indeed she would spend
the rest of her life living with her mother in New York, in Greenwich
Village and in Brooklyn in a small apartment.] [C]ontrary to your
impression, I am altogether blond and have red hair. [Pound had asked
whether she was Ethiopian, after he read the poem "Black Earth": read
"Black Earth" and decide whether Marianne Moore is an Ethiopian.]<br />
<br />
[This is important. She says] …Any verse that I have written, has been
an arrangement of stanzas, each stanza being an exact duplicate of
every other stanza. [This is not always true but she claims it is.] I
have occasionally been at pains to make an arrangement of lines and
rhymes that I like repeat itself, but the form of the original stanza
of anything I have written has been a matter of expediency, hit upon as
being approximately suitable to the subject matter. The resemblance of
my progress to your beginnings is an accident….<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</blockquote>

<p>"I wasn't influenced by you, Pound, when I started writing syllabic
verse" because Pound had experimented with this himself. There're a
couple of ideas here that are important. First of all, that Moore
identifies, as it were, two moments of creativity involved in the
making of her poems. One is a moment of spontaneity and expediency in
which lines, almost like some kind of channeled speech, arrive in a
certain form, and then she makes that form in its contingency and
accidentalness repeat itself. She goes on and what came by chance she
repeats through will, through discipline. This is significant and it's
related to, well, her originality of form, which is something that, as
it were, comes to her naturally and that she builds on self-consciously
and through a kind of rigorous self-discipline.</p>

<p>She says then, "I do not appear." She meant, "I don't appear in
literary periodicals; you can't find my poems anywhere." But the
sentence itself is wonderfully suggestive and simple, "I do not
appear." And in fact, Moore does not appear very much in her poems. She
is interestingly backgrounded or even invisible in her poems, in the
ways that she is in "A Grave." And then she says:</p>

<blockquote>I grow less and less desirous of being published, produce
less and have a strong feeling for letting alone what little I do
produce.<br />
<br />
[And then she continues] …To capitalize the first word of every line is
rather slavish [as they do in nineteenth-century poetry] and I have
substituted small letters for capitals in the enclosed versions of the
two poems that you have. [This is another sort of distinctive, formal
choice Moore makes, not to capitalize her first lines--something
Williams does, too.]<br />
<br />
…In "A Graveyard," [she goes on, now talking about the poem "A Grave"
(a grave is better than a graveyard, don't you think?)] [the change]
that I have made is to end of the line [the very end of the poem] as
you suggest and for the sake of symmetry, have altered the arrangement
of lines in the preceding stanzas. I realize that by writing
consciousness and volition [this is the order of the words that Pound
had proposed at the end of that poem] emphasis is obtained which is
sacrificed by retaining the order which I have [that is, Moore's order,
"volition" and then "consciousness"], and I am willing to make the
change, though I prefer the original order [which, in fact, ultimately
she kept].</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Let's look at the end of the poem again. I'll read from line 20:</p>

<blockquote>…the ocean, under the pulsation of lighthouses and noise of
bell-buoys, advances as usual, looking as if it were not the ocean in
which dropped things are bound to sink-- in which if they turn and
twist, it is neither with volition nor consciousness.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Pound said, "Well, that ending just doesn't quite do it. Why don't
you switch 'consciousness' and 'volition'?" With what implication? That
somehow "volition" is more important than "consciousness," that it's
the last thing to go and the most dramatic thing to lose. Moore,
however, insists: no, that's not the case; it's the other way around.
"Consciousness" is more important than "volition." In fact, that's
really what this whole poem is about, you could say. Pound wanted the
emphasis, to take Moore's word, that comes with stressing "volition" as
most important and, in fact, volition is nothing but a kind of
expression of emphasis. She says no, "consciousness" is more important,
and as she does, she emphasizes it. She introduces another kind of
emphasis, one associated not specifically with volition so much as the
drama and power of consciousness, which she insists on here.</p>

<p>Although Moore's poem could be, in fact, read as a kind of rebuke in
advance to Hart Crane and his poem "At Melville's Tomb," Moore, in
fact, got to know and like Crane in the twenties, sometimes acting as
his editor when he sent poems to <i>The Dial</i> for publication. She
turned back "At Melville's Tomb." She accepted other poems. One poem
she accepted, "The Wine Menagerie," was a poem in quatrains. She
accepted it and then converted the poem into free verse and reduced it
by half its size. Crane accepted it, accepted this publication along
with ten dollars, which he needed. But both Crane and Moore, like
Williams, were, I think, self-consciously American poets, and their
American-ness is important to how they define themselves as modern
poets. And there is really in all of them a certain kind of combative,
cultural nationalism, which has aesthetic and ethical implications.</p>

<p>As an example, let's turn a page back and look at the poem
"England." Okay, the poem begins here as a series of national
caricatures and then eventually it will move from these caricatures,
which suggest ways of life and also aesthetic dispositions, ways of
doing and thinking about art, I think; she'll move from that to talk
about America, and what is American. And this is, you could say, her
real subject here.</p>

<blockquote>England [and you think that's the title, but it's not the
title, it's the first line<br />
 of the poem]<br />
<br />
With its baby [or it's not only the title, it's also the first line of
the poem]<br />
 rivers and little towns, each with its abbey or its cathedral,<br />
 with voices--one voice perhaps, echoing through the
transept--the<br />
 criterion of suitability and convenience [so much for England]: and
Italy<br />
 with its equal<br />
 shores--contriving an epicureanism from which the grossness has
been<br />
<br />
extracted [the Italians are refined]: and Greece with its goats and
its<br />
 gourds, the nest of modified illusions:<br />
 and France, the "chrysalis of the nocturnal butterfly," in<br />
 whose products, mystery of construction diverts one from what
was<br />
 originally one's<br />
 object--substance at the core [the French are--well, they're
French]:<br />
 and the East with its snails, its emotional<br />
<br />
shorthand and jade cockroaches, its rock crystal and its
imperturbability,<br />
 all of museum quality [she continues, same sentence]: and
America…</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And then she will go on and describe America. She will go on and
contrast everything that she has just caricatured in a polite but
essentially negative way, in each of those cases, with the American,
and specifically with American speech and American English. She
says:</p>

<blockquote>…and America where there<br />
 is the little old ramshackle victoria in the south, where cigars are
smoked<br />
 on the<br />
 street in the north; where there are no proof readers, no silkworms,
no<br />
 digressions;<br />
<br />
the wild man's land; grass-less, links-less, language-less country
in<br />
 which letters are written<br />
 not in Spanish, not in Greek, not in Latin, not in short-hand<br />
 but in plain American which cats and dogs can read! The letter "a"
in<br />
 psalm and calm when<br />
<br />
pronounced with the sound of "a" in candle, is very noticeable
[psalm,<br />
 calm] but<br />
 why should continents of misapprehension have to be accounted for
by<br />
 the<br />
 fact?</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>In other words, just because Americans who say "psalm" or "calm"
sound like that instead of "psalm" or "calm," that doesn't mean they're
stupid or that the rest of America is.</p>

<blockquote>…Does it follow that because there are poisonous
toadstools<br />
 which resemble mushrooms, both are dangerous? [No.] In the case
of<br />
 mettlesomeness which may be<br />
 mistaken for appetite, of heat which may appear to be haste,
con-<br />
<br />
clusions may be drawn. To have misapprehended the matter is to
have<br />
 confessed<br />
 that one has not looked far enough….</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>In other words, if you don't think you can get poetry in America,
you haven't looked.</p>

<blockquote>The sublimated wisdom<br />
 of China, Egyptian discernment, the cataclysmic torrent of
emotion<br />
 compressed<br />
 in the verbs of the Hebrew language, the books of the man who is
able<br />
<br />
to say, "I envy nobody but him and him only, who catches more fish
than<br />
 I do,"--the flower and fruit of all that noted superi-<br />
 ority--should one not have stumbled upon it in America, must one<br />
 imagine<br />
 that it is not there? It has never been confined to one
locality.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It's a wonderful poem. It's a defense of America and American
creativity, American language. It is an attack on Eurocentric, cultural
snobs. At the same time, Moore is not only or merely adding America as
one among other nations. Rather, America is the locality where this
principle of hers is honored, a place that incorporates many other
places, many other cultures, many other ways of feeling and thinking
and speaking. This principle, the idea that inspiration has never been
confined to one locality, to one place, affirms a kind of art that is
not only a matter of high culture but that is also vernacular,
regional, heterogeneous, popular, and includes in it all kinds of
materials. And you remember the quotation I pointed to in the first day
of class when I quoted from Moore's poem "Poetry"? And she was talking
about all the things that should go in poetry, even business documents
and school books. Well, America is a place where you can put those
things in poems.</p>

<p>This is a proud, also a comical principle. It's a democratic
principle for Moore. Is it maybe also a feminist one? I think so, in so
far as Moore defines what is American as specifically and distinctively
a non-hierarchical point of view: that is, not so much a woman's point
of view so much as a point of view that accommodates that of the woman
among others, within a multiplicity of human perspectives and, in fact,
non-human perspectives. She's serious about including those cats and
dogs.</p>

<p>Why is the poem called "England"? By incorporating the title into
the first line of the poem, Moore makes it seem accidental. The device
foregrounds Moore's concision and practicality. Why waste any extra
words on the title? Pound wants you to use no word that does not
contribute to the presentation; okay, then we'll make the title part of
the presentation, too. The gesture is also of a piece, I think, with
Moore's distrust of hierarchy itself. She says, in effect, the title is
not more important than the rest of the poem. It doesn't stand outside
it or above it, it's just part of it; just as Moore found it slavish
and probably pretentious to capitalize the first word of every line of
verse. She wants to, in that sense, give dignity to the lowercase, to
non-capital letters.</p>

<p>At the same time Moore is very wily and clever. England really is
important here; that is, it's not merely the first nation in an
arbitrarily arranged list. She's defending America and American English
specifically against the noted superiority of England and English
literature, where of course Pound, Eliot, Frost and others had gone to
establish themselves as poets. And to this extent she's saying that the
title is not so important that it stands above the poem; England is not
so important that it stands over and above America. And in this sense
the title, in fact, turns out to be important and to give us important
information, because she's out here to make England less important and
to deny it its pride of place.</p>

<p>Well, we've got just a few minutes left to start a long, difficult
and truly marvelous poem called "An Octopus" that exemplifies Moore as
a nature poet and exemplifies many of the distinctive features of her
writing. Again, this is on page 441. The title of the poem is the first
line. We might think that this is going to be a poem about an octopus.
Well, not exactly. In effect, the title is a kind of riddle that the
poem will go on and explain and expand on. It's a poem about Mount
Rainier, Mount Rainier where Moore went with her brother John in 1922,
that same year that Joyce published <i>Ulysses</i> and Eliot ended the
idea of poetry for ladies in <i>The Waste Land</i>.</p>

<p>The poem involves a kind of essential contradiction which it works
through in complex ways. On the one hand, the mountain that Moore calls
an octopus, that she's writing about here, is something that is exactly
"other." It's outside the poet; it's out there, like the sea in "A
Grave." It's objectified; it's something Moore has to stand apart from,
perhaps try to conquer in the form of climbing it or conquer in the
form of representing it in her writing. And yet, in the course of the
poem, the mountain and its glacier, which is really the octopus that
she's talking about, is something that Moore identifies herself with,
that comes to look like Moore in certain ways. It comes to be
identified with the force of her art. So, it's both a kind of version
of herself and it's a version of something "other," too.</p>

<p>The poem is filled with an extraordinary and bewildering detail that
evokes the natural world as one of extraordinary and bewildering
detail. At the same time, it combines and creates a fantastic collage
of quotation from a wild variety of sources. It's hard to know where to
start and stop in this poem, what its parts are. It's a question that,
in a sense, Moore is asking about the mountain itself. There's in
general a kind of analogy throughout the poem between the mountain and
the woman who admires it, whose mind itself can seem octopus-like, and
reaches out in these long tentacle-like lines to grasp the world, make
it her own, freeze it in poetic language, even while she's insisting on
the wonderful otherness of the world.</p>

<p>I won't start reading now at the end of class but let me say a
couple of further things about the poem and ask you to re-read it, and
to, knowing that it's hard, re-read it more than once, and maybe not
continuously. It's a very hard poem to read continuously. Be sure to
read the last paragraph of it carefully that begins on page 444.</p>

<p>And let me say something before we stop about quotation. You
remember that the sea in "A Grave" mocked the rapacious collector.
Moore herself was a great collector. She collected, among other things,
quotations. She engrosses them; she gathers them to her; she masters
her reading. She brings them into this poem in, as I say, a kind of
collage. It gives the poem a kind of, well, a very strange
polyvocality. There's many, many voices here. Think of <i>The Waste
Land</i>. Well, Moore rivals it in this poem; many voices that again
democratically allow for, you could say, multiple perspectives,
multiple kinds of material.</p>

<p>Unlike <i>The Waste Land</i>, Moore is not quoting only high art
sources by and large; well, Eliot has his popular culture, too, but we
know that it's pretty much a high culture poem. Well, Moore is making
her poem out of magazines, out of a pamphlet from The National Parks
Portfolio, through her reading in Ruskin and many other sources. And it
treats those various texts, you could say, non-hierarchically, without
a kind of regard to generic valuations. She doesn't play off high and
low as Eliot does in "A Game of Chess," for example.</p>

<p>It makes the sources of poetic language and of poetry continuous
with ordinary life, her activities of reading; and at the same time, it
makes Moore's inspiration deeply personal, because who else but
Marianne Moore would have read all this stuff, or just these things?
Like Pound, a kind of visionary scholar who found his muse in a
translated Homer, Moore, knowing that literary inspiration is not
confined to any locality, finds it all over the place in her reading.
But again, what she's reading is something different from Eliot and
Pound. And I'll say more about that next time.</p>
