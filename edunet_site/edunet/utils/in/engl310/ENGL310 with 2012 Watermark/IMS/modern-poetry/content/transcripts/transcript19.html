<p><b>Professor Langdon Hammer</b>: On Wednesday, I would like you to
come having read one of Stevens's longer poems. It's not too long but
it's a little longer: "The Auroras of Autumn," which is a wonderful
poem. It's not exactly timely at this moment but please come having
thought about it. As you read it, think about images that you find in
the poem of stars, of the theater, of mother and father; the poem is
full of both.</p>

<p>A friend asked me the other day, "Are there any happy poets?" Well,
of course no, there really aren't, or at least not any that are any
good. No, that's not true. In fact, as I think about the syllabus,
Williams is a happy poet. He calls himself the "happy genius" of his
household in that little poem, "Danse Russe," where he's talking about
running around the house naked. Marianne Moore, I think, in many ways
is a happy poet. But no poet is so happy as Wallace Stevens. And
Stevens is happy in the sense that he is a comic poet. And that doesn't
mean that you're going to laugh a lot while you read Wallace Stevens,
though you might sometimes. And he can be silly, though that's perhaps
not his strongest vein.</p>

<p>Stevens is a comic poet in the sense, in the generic sense of a poet
in whom and for whom and with whom the world always comes right. The
world is right and good. It is a regenerative, exhilarating, endlessly
consoling and meaningful place to dwell. And Stevens is, you know,
really as I read him every year, I like him more and more, and he
becomes more and more important. Stevens gives us, really, a
comprehensive view of the world and one in which poetry and imagination
have central roles to play. Imagination: that's an important word in
Stevens. It's a word he takes right out of British romanticism and the
long tradition of romantic poetry. And Stevens is, though in complex
ways, like Hart Crane, a defiantly romantic modern poet.</p>

<p>Stevens's poetry, like Moore's, like Crane's – to some extent like
Frost's – is always, in a sense, meta-poetry. That is, well, he shares
with these poets, as with certain others on our syllabus, the sense
that poetry has to always involve an investigation into its own rules:
how it works, what it does, what it's capable of, what its potential
uses are; and that all these are in a sense open and available to
re-definition at a fundamental level. He says--There's a sort of
wonderful set of adages or epigrams or statements at the back of your
book which come from Stevens's "Adagia." One of those statements is
"all poetry is experimental poetry." And there's a sense in any Stevens
poem that Stevens is experimenting and is going in some new direction,
not just at the beginning of the poem but throughout the poem. That's
how it proceeds. You could compare this idea to Williams's interest in
newness and a sense of life as "always subversive of life preceding."
It's a related idea for Stevens.</p>

<p>In his poem, "Of Modern Poetry," which is a little essay on the
subject of what is modern poetry, Stevens says, "It has / to construct
a new stage." And it not only has to construct that new stage, it has
to "be on it," too. And there's a way in which Stevens's poems are both
creating a new space in which to speak, and they're speaking from
there. These two things are going on at once. Stevens also says in that
set of "Adagia" – and there are wonderful, provocative ones throughout,
"A poem is a pheasant," for one – he also says, "Poetry is a means of
redemption." That's on page 972. "Poetry is a means of redemption." He
meant it, he meant it. For Stevens, poetry stands in the place that
religion once did. Other poets that we've read this semester look to
poetry to serve different functions of religion, I think. Eliot is
concerned with ritual and community and ways in which poetry might
establish these, constitute these. Moore is the most, well, with Eliot,
the most serious Christian; is concerned with poetry as a model for
ethical action, as a kind of guide for conduct in the world. And poetry
models for her what she calls "love" or "hope" or striving or "doing
hard things."</p>

<p>For Stevens, poetry takes over another dimension of religious
experience. Poetry takes over Christianity's traditional concern with
redemption, and with redemption – with questions about the afterlife,
paradise – the transcendental. How can culture imagine the
transcendental in a non-transcendental world? How can it imagine the
metaphysical in a non-metaphysical world? How can we have Heaven if we
don't have God? These are all questions in Stevens's poetry. He answers
them in ways that put him on Hart Crane's side of the debate with
Eliot. In <i>The Waste Land</i>, the decay of sacred authority; this is
a crisis of community, of meaning; language has lost its meaning. For
Crane, this condition, rather than a crisis, is an opportunity, an
opportunity for poetry to "lend a myth to God." Eliot is disturbed to
see God as something constructed, something linguistic, something we
might lend a myth to; only lend it, in the sense that we're going to
have to get it back. For Crane, for Stevens, God always was a myth, a
metaphor, and metaphors can and need to be exchanged and renewed all
the time. In this, Crane and Stevens are very close together.</p>

<p>Let's look at an early poem of Wallace Stevens's, an early grand
poem called "Sunday Morning," the first one in your Stevens's
selection. It's on page 237. "Sunday Morning" was published in
<i>Poetry</i> magazine in 1915, which is to say, it's contemporary with
Prufrock, roughly contemporary with Marianne Moore's "A Grave"; both
poems that appeared in <i>Poetry</i>, too. Let's read this first
stanza.</p>

<blockquote>Complacencies of the peignoir, and late<br />
 Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair,<br />
 And the green freedom of a cockatoo<br />
 Upon a rug [all these things] mingle to dissipate<br />
 The holy hush of ancient sacrifice.<br />
 She dreams a little, and she feels the dark<br />
 Encroachment of that old catastrophe, ["that old catastrophe" being
the<br />
 crucifixion]<br />
 As a calm darkens among water-lights. [Or if it's not the crucifixion,
it's<br />
 the Fall.]<br />
 The pungent oranges and bright, green wings<br />
 Seem things in some procession of the dead,<br />
 Winding across wide water, without sound.<br />
 The day is like wide water, without sound,<br />
 Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet<br />
 Over the seas, to silent Palestine,<br />
 Dominion of the blood and sepulchre.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>This is a poem about not going to church, about doing something else
with Sunday morning. It announces or it takes for granted really a
great change in culture, a change in the cultural order where Sunday
morning is no longer spent, or need not necessarily always be spent, at
church. Stevens is writing about, in some ways, the end of the
Christian Era. Of course, it's gone on but in a different form from
what it had been. You could think about how little this poem is like a
poem on a similar theme in Yeats, such as "The Second Coming," where
the end of Christianity is an apocalyptic event and there's some "rough
beast" "slouching towards Bethlehem." Instead, in Stevens the power of
the past, the Christian Era, simply dissipates – poof! – dissolves in
the circumstances that he's describing.</p>

<p>What is a peignoir? I think Stevens likes the French word. This is a
dressing gown. We have a female figure here presented to us in a space
of domestic bourgeois luxury, with comfort and complacency even, with
coffee and oranges, and a cockatoo. Whether that cockatoo is actually a
bird or a design in the rug, critics have disagreed; you can make that
bird what you like. This female presence that we're introduced to is a
figure for the poet, an unnamed "she" that the poem will be about. She,
embodying poetic sensibility, poetic thinking and poetic impulses,
seems to place poetry in this space of domestic comfort, seems to
identify poetry with the feminine, with a female perspective, and with
consumption, with fine imported goods, as you will find elsewhere in
Stevens. She identifies a life of ease with the imagination. Stevens's
poetry, like Yeats's in certain ways, though on very different terms,
or even like Eliot's, presents us with a number of very powerful female
figures with whom the poet identifies his own creativity. This is an
important one. And there's an aspect of Stevens that's gendered as
feminine, you could say. It's that aspect of Stevens that identifies
with poetry as a space apart from the masculine world of work. Contrast
this with Frost who identifies poetry with subjective freedom, a space
apart from objective necessity, what Frost is always responding to.</p>

<p>Stevens maintains a complex attitude, however, towards this
identification of poetry with aspects of culture that are gendered as
female. There's a macho strain in Stevens too, often a hyperbolic and
somewhat comic one in which Stevens is identifying with giants, big
men. And I'll talk more about that two lectures from now. In this poem,
I think, well, possibly warding off the anxiety of identifying poetry
so clearly and strongly with the female, Stevens includes in stanza
seven, on pages 239 to 240, a kind of parodic celebration of
masculinity:</p>

<blockquote>Supple and turbulent, a ring of men<br />
 Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn<br />
 Their boisterous devotion to the sun,<br />
 Not as a god, but as a god might be,<br />
 Naked among them, like a savage source.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And so on. This is another vein of Stevens's imagination and it's
here in this poem in, again, almost hyperbolic comic form.</p>

<p>If Stevens is anxious about identifying poetry with the feminine, I
think that's because, in a sense, as Stevens sets things up here at
this early point in his career, all poets are women poets on Sunday
morning. Poetry can only be written on Sunday morning or on the weekend
or after hours, at the end of the workday. These are the spaces in
which in his life poetry exists, but more generally these are the sort
of cultural spaces, the times, that Stevens identifies poetry with.
Here in this poem, Stevens is brooding on the bourgeois image of the
earthly paradise; that is, what it's like to have a nice home and some
free time in it. It's a poem that Stevens wrote in his twenties, in the
earliest phase of his career. Like Eliot, like Frost, Stevens went to
Harvard. All these modern poets went to Harvard. He was from early on
divided in his ambitions between poetry and the law, a securely
masculine pursuit. Stevens tried journalism briefly in New York and a
legal practice before eventually he entered the Hartford Accident and
Indemnity Company in our state, where he remained for the rest of his
life, becoming a national authority on surety bonds and leading an
extraordinary divided life: a life in which poetry was identified with
leisure and repose.</p>

<p>There's a kind of sybaritic quality to Stevens's imagination. He
luxuriates. In another one of those "Adagia" he says, "A poem is a
café." And so it is, in Stevens's case. Poetry represents a kind of
release from objective disciplines, including the nineteenth-century
Protestant injunctions to refuse private pleasures, to save for a
future life, perhaps a life beyond life, an afterlife. This is the
"Puritanism" that Crane objects to early in his career and fights
against. And Stevens, too, is here in a more cautious way struggling
against it. On page 238, in the second stanza of this poem, he says,
"Why should she give her bounty to the dead?"</p>

<p>Why should she give her spirit, her imaginative investments, her
hopes to the dead? Here, suggesting both the dead Jesus and also a
future life beyond life that Christianity would look towards. Stevens
is imagining earth itself as where bounty is given and where it should
be bestowed. It's where we are. And he'll go on and describe it in this
stanza:</p>

<blockquote>What is divinity if it can come<br />
 Only in silent shadows and in dreams?<br />
 Shall she not find in comforts of the sun,<br />
 In pungent fruit and bright, green wings, or else<br />
 In any balm or beauty of the earth,<br />
 Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven? [No, divinity can't
be<br />
 off somewhere else. It can't be beyond life.]<br />
 Divinity must live within herself: [And what form does it take
there?]<br />
 Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow;<br />
 Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued<br />
 Elations when the forest blooms; gusty<br />
 Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights;<br />
 All pleasures and all pains, remembering<br />
 The bough of summer and the winter branch.<br />
 These are the measures destined for her soul.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Here, divinity must live within the person in her subjectivity, a
subjectivity that's modeled on and represented as a version of the
sensual encounter with the seasons, which are themselves revolving and
balanced and cyclical: "the bough of summer and the winter branch." To
say that paradise must be here on earth is also to say that it must
include death and dying, a world of change, a world that's always, in a
sense, passing out of existence. And Stevens says in stanza five:</p>

<blockquote>… "But in contentment [she says, he says with her] I still
feel<br />
 The need of some imperishable bliss."<br />
 Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her,<br />
 Alone, shall come fulfillment to our dreams<br />
 And our desires.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Yes. Paradise, if it is to exist on earth, must include death in it.
And as the poem moves towards its close, that's what Stevens imagines
for us. It's also, well, it's a scene that he leaves us with in the
eighth stanza. It's a scene of a world of plenty, a beautiful world but
also a world which, for these reasons, includes death in it. Let's look
at that. It returns to the opening lines of the poem, and then the
camera pans out to give a view of the landscape and the world around
us:</p>

<blockquote>She hears, upon that water without sound,<br />
 A voice that cries, "The tomb in Palestine<br />
 Is not the porch of spirits lingering.<br />
 It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay."</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>The tomb is empty. Jesus is not a presence for us. And now Stevens
moves for the first time in the poem out of that third person, "she,"
to speak in the first person plural.</p>

<blockquote>We live in an old chaos of the sun,<br />
 Or old dependency of day and night,<br />
 Or island solitude, unsponsored, free,<br />
 Of that wide water, inescapable.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>"We live in an old chaos of the sun": we live in a world that is
material. It exists as a set of rocks, blasted across the universe,
that the sun structures and radiates. Even as Stevens makes this
declaration, characteristic of him is the resistance to residing in any
one formulation. So, he'll say one thing and then he'll say another,
"or," and notice this pattern here where he, in fact, gives us two
"or"s. "Old dependency of day and night": That's another way of imaging
our world where day and night, these essential contraries, these
essential natural forms, are dependent on each other, are constituting
each other continuously. We are dependent on them; they are dependent
on each other. We exist "or" – perhaps – in "island solitude." Here the
world, the globe, this natural space, this earthly paradise, is an
island, and a solitary one, one without God out there, in a condition
Stevens will call "unsponsored" and therefore free. "Of that wide
water, inescapable," where that wide water that was first introduced to
us in the first stanza of the poem, becomes a kind of image for a
silence in the world, which is the silence of a lack of, I think,
divine language. From these generalizations, Stevens then moves to
these particulars:</p>

<blockquote>Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail<br />
 Whistle about us their spontaneous cries;<br />
 Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness;<br />
 And, in the isolation of the sky,<br />
 At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make<br />
 Ambiguous undulations as they sink,<br />
 Downward to darkness, on extended wings.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Stevens's approach, finally, is not to generalize about the world
but to describe it; to not tell us how things should be or might be or
were, but rather how they are; how they are now and at this moment.
Stevens evokes the world in a state of fullness, of ripeness. Those
berries are ripening, there're deer walking on the mountains. That
present tense that he's using evokes action that is ongoing, is
present. And yet all these essential satisfactions that he evokes are
colored by evening. Pleasure here is shadowed by death, not unhappily,
but it is the color of the environment, of the evening. The birds, they
make a downward movement, and yet their wings are extended. Their
undulations are ambiguous in that sense, much as the "dependency of day
and night" is itself ambiguous. You could contrast those birds with
Hart Crane's ascending seagull at the beginning of "The Bridge." This
is a different image. Stevens is here trying to image for us a
non-transcendental, secular vision of the world.</p>

<p>Let's look ahead to another poem, "The Poems of Our Climate" on page
252, another poem exploring the idea of paradise. Stevens means here in
that title, "The Poems of Our Climate," America, our culture, our
environment, our situation. It's a poem that you might read alongside a
poem like "England" by Marianne Moore. He also means the poems of our
time or our moment. And our time or our moment for Stevens is defined
as a climate, as a kind of environment rather than some other kind of
overarching way of understanding or defining the present moment. It's
not, as the poem unfolds, a question about nature so much as about
culture. Stevens will here explore one of his recurrent impulses; that
is, to renew poetry by simplifying terms, by getting down to some
essentials, some primary elements. If Stevens is a sensualist, he's
also a kind of ascetic. He can be both and even finds, I suppose, a
kind of sensual asceticism, and this poem exemplifies that.</p>

<blockquote>Clear water in a brilliant bowl,<br />
 Pink and white carnations. The light<br />
 In the room more like a snowy air,<br />
 Reflecting snow. A newly-fallen snow<br />
 At the end of winter when afternoons return. [We still don't have a
main<br />
 verb yet.]<br />
 Pink and white carnations--one desires<br />
 So much more than that. The day itself<br />
 Is simplified: a bowl of white,<br />
 Cold, a cold porcelain, low and round,<br />
 With nothing more than the carnations there.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>This is Stevens exploring another version of secularity, of the
secular, giving us a poetry it seems, as he starts, not of ideas but of
things, as Williams might approve. It is a world of white. You can
understand the impulse here as a version of the reduction to nakedness
or the reduction to primary terms that Imagism seeks to accomplish. And
these are, in a sense, precisely images that Stevens is presenting to
us, almost as a kind of still-life there: that clear water in a
brilliant bowl and the pink and white carnations, where that word
"carnation" – from the Latin, meaning flesh – evokes the colors of the
body and of blood and of flesh, and yet those qualities are here held
in a kind of suspension that contains them and treats them coolly and
arranges them and it's unsatisfying to Stevens. The moment he has
created this still life, he starts to want to get rid of it. He
says:</p>

<blockquote>Say even that this complete simplicity [that I've just
produced here]<br />
 Stripped one [in fact, of the heat, of the flesh] of all one's
torments,<br />
 concealed<br />
 The evilly compounded, vital I<br />
 And made if fresh in a world of white,<br />
 A world of clear water, brilliant-edged,<br />
 Still one would want more, one would need more,<br />
 More than a world of white and snowy scents.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And again, this is characteristic of Stevens and his imagination. If
he said one thing, he will now try something else. He will now turn his
strategy in another direction. He continues here affirming powers of
mind:</p>

<blockquote>There would still remain the never-resting mind,<br />
 So that one would want to escape, come back<br />
 To what had been so long composed.<br />
 The imperfect is our paradise.<br />
 Note that, in this bitterness, delight,<br />
 Since the imperfect is so hot in us,<br />
 Lies in flawed words and stubborn sounds.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>The "never-resting mind" always wants more. Even as it wants to get
down to primary terms, it then wants more again. Paradise is "the
imperfect," "the imperfect" meaning, again, Stevens is always playing
on Latin, I think; the imperfect is the incompleted, the not finished,
the ongoing. And, too, there are tinges in that word "imperfect" of
corruption, of fallenness, of flaws, as Stevens will go on to say. The
imperfect is something that's not cold but "hot," as people are hot,
hot with desire. It's the heat of desire that shows itself, as Stevens
says, in "flawed words and stubborn sounds."</p>

<p>Stevens affirms the "never-resting mind" but above all he affirms a
kind of continuing impulse and demand to speak, to find "flawed words
and stubborn sounds." Over the course of the poem, Stevens moves from a
still world to a world in action, and he moves from a world that's
visual to a world that is verbal, that's linguistic. Here and elsewhere
in Stevens, language is the privileged medium of human desire and
aspiration. It's what gives us "delight," his word here; it gives us
pleasure, and in this sense it remains – language does – on the side of
leisure and of play rather than of discipline and work. And yet, also
note the implications of those adjectives. "Flawed": "flawed" implies
craft, some kind of making, I think. And "stubborn": "stubborn"
suggests perseverance, discipline; perhaps surprisingly, a kind of
continuing will to, well, not to rest and to go on speaking. These
values that emerge in this poem are, well, recurrent in Stevens. You'll
find him exploring them, celebrating them elsewhere.</p>

<p>Let's go forward to the poem called "The Man on the Dump," on page
254, for another poem, again, exploring and affirming certain
capacities of language. This is Stevens at play in the landscape of
<i>The Waste Land</i>, if you like. Stevens in a letter explains that
on his way to work – he walked to work from West Hartford to downtown –
he would observe, during the Depression, a man on the dump and composed
this poem prompted by him.</p>

<blockquote>Day creeps down. The moon is creeping up.<br />
 The sun is a corbeil of flowers the moon<br />
 Blanche [of course she's Blanche, it's the white moon]<br />
 Places there, a bouquet. Ho-ho… The dump is full<br />
 Of images [just like <i>The Waste Land</i>]. Days pass like papers
from a<br />
 press.<br />
 The bouquets come here in the papers. So the sun,<br />
 And so the moon, both come, and the janitor's poems<br />
 Of every day, the wrapper on the can of pears,<br />
 The cat in the paper-bag, the corset, the box<br />
 From Estonia: the tiger chest, for tea.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>If Stevens celebrates desire, celebrates consumption and sensual
pleasure, as he does, well, that makes a certain amount of garbage.
That makes a certain amount of waste. If you are constantly seeking new
ways of phrasing and understanding the world, you're going to have to
be getting rid of the ones you just had, the ones that you were just
using. And the dump is an image of this, which Stevens confronts here
with a certain kind of irritation, playful but not so far, I think,
from despair. The dump is a place of old poetry, and, of course,
Stevens's own poetry doesn't want to end up there. Or maybe it does,
since Stevens is able to find in the dump a certain kind of
regenerative power:</p>

<blockquote>The freshness of night [any poet knows] has been fresh a
long time.<br />
 The freshness of morning, the blowing of day, one says<br />
 That it puffs as Cornelius Nepos reads, it puffs<br />
 More than, less than or it puffs like this or that.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Maybe it's just all air, these poems. Stevens is talking about the
problem of cliché. He's talking about, well, the way in which any
formulation dies, becomes frozen, becomes a bouquet you must throw out.
This is a condition in <i>The Waste Land</i> that Eliot profoundly
mistrusts. Stevens, on the other hand, sees in it a potential for a
vision of the self that is consoling and is powerful. Stevens
generates, as the poem goes on, an image of the poet as a man on the
dump, one who "beats an old tin can" and makes stubborn sounds, which
are, if you like, sounds of his own stubbornness. Stevens is willing,
as Eliot is not, to make belief be a personal thing, to be something
that each of us constructs out of our own will and our own powers of
speech. As the poem develops, Stevens goes through a kind of a gesture
of throwing things out; a kind of reduction to primary terms that is
like "The Poems of Our Climate," as around line 21 or so he says:</p>

<blockquote>Now in the time of spring (azaleas, trilliums,<br />
 Myrtle, viburnums, daffodils, blue phlox) [you know all the
names],<br />
 Between that disgust and this [and I think there is disgust in the
poem],<br />
 between the things<br />
 That are on the dump (azaleas and so on)<br />
 And those that will be (azaleas and so on),<br />
 One feels the purifying change. One rejects<br />
 The trash.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And as one rejects the trash, as one gets down to some kind of
primary whiteness, some kind of fresh seeing of the world, we then
start to see the moon in perhaps different terms, not merely as
"Blanche," some old lady from poems from the past, but perhaps in some
new terms. Stevens says:</p>

<blockquote>That's the moment when the moon creeps up<br />
 To the bubbling of bassoons. That's the time<br />
 One looks at the elephant-colorings of tires [even this ugliness
is<br />
 interesting].<br />
 Everything is shed; the moon comes up then as the moon<br />
 (All its images are in the dump) [you have to see it freshly] and you
see<br />
 [because you're seeing freshly now]<br />
 As a man (not like an image of a man),<br />
 You see the moon rise in the empty sky.<br />
<br />
One sits and beats an old tin can, lard pail.<br />
 One beats and beats for that which one believes.<br />
 That's what one wants to get near. Could it after all<br />
 Be merely oneself…</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>That you want to get near, that you need to get near? Stevens is
willing to say yes, whereas Eliot is, as I say, frightened of this
prospect.</p>

<blockquote>… as superior as the ear<br />
 To a crow's voice? Did the nightingale torture the ear,<br />
 Pack the heart and scratch the mind? And does the ear<br />
 Solace itself in peevish birds? Is it peace,<br />
 Is it a philosopher's honeymoon, one finds<br />
 On the dump? Is it to sit among the mattresses of the dead,<br />
 Bottles, pots, shoes and grass and murmur <i>aptest eve</i>:<br />
 Is it to hear the blatter of grackles and say<br />
 <i>Invisible priest</i>; is it to eject, to pull<br />
 The day to pieces and cry <i>stanza my stone</i>?<br />
 Where was it one first heard of the truth? The the.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It's a wonderful poem that's on the verge of nonsense, that's on the
verge of a kind of personal language that, as I say, is an apocalyptic
thing in <i>The Waste Land</i> but is here a source of energy and power
and play for Stevens. Stevens is not afraid of nonsense, he's not
afraid of idiosyncrasy of expression. He is willing to play with words.
Linguistic play puts Stevens in touch with a kind of primal poetic
resource. Stevens understands truth as something that is linguistic;
it's something constructed in and through language. It is therefore
perishable. It is also for the same reason renewable.</p>

<p>Look at that last line. "Where was it one first heard of the truth?
The the." "The the," if you prefer. That last sentence fragment, "The
the," what is that? Is that an answer or a clarification to the
question, "Where was it one first heard of the truth?" In other words,
where did this idea of truth come from to begin with? Where did you get
that idea? Why do you want it? You want it because it is something that
you have heard about; it is something that has been spoken of. It has
come to us as language has framed it. "The the": the definite article.
It's the definite article that makes the truth the truth. Otherwise, it
would be merely only what? A truth. That is, to indicate and declare
truth in its singularity, to give it this status – that is a linguistic
act. The truth is the function, as Stevens understands it, of a certain
linguistic capacity: in this case a verbal formula which takes priority
ultimately over any specific content or doctrine, any truth. In that
sense, the truth lies in "The the."</p>

<p>"The the" is here representative of the human capacity for
declaration, for statement, a specifically verbal and linguistic power.
The truth that it represents is not in any sense a final term, a last
word, a doctrine, a particular content of any kind. Instead, it points
to a way of thinking, a medium of thought, a medium of thought and
desire, a process which is a process of naming or, as Stevens would
also call it in "Of Modern Poetry", an "act of finding." This is what
language does in Stevens. It creates the world; it finds the world; it
constructs the world through such elementary terms as the definite
article.</p>

<p>Well, we'll hear more about the implications of this perspective on
experience next time and following.</p>
