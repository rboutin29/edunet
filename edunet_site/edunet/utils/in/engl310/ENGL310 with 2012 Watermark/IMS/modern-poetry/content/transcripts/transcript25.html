<p><b>Professor Langdon Hammer</b>: Today I'm going to try to talk a
little bit more about Elizabeth Bishop, and I'm also going to try to
give some big perspectives on the poets we've been reading and also
some ways of thinking about how they fit together.</p>

<p>Let's look at Bishop's poem, "Over 2,000 Illustrations and a
Complete Concordance," the poem placed second in her second book called
<i>A Cold Spring</i>, published in 1955--the latest poems that we'll
discuss in this course. On Wednesday I talked about Bishop's poetics of
geography or travel as a horizontal poetics, as opposed to the
ascendant and sublime impulses in many of the poets that we have been
examining this term. This poetics is ultimately a poetry of shifting
perspectives and local perceptions. The question that it immediately
poses is, well: how do we put these perceptions and these points of
view together? The, I think, exciting but also difficult textures of
Bishop's great landscape poems, "Florida," "Cape Breton," "At the
Fishhouses," "A Cold Spring," and others, all pose this very clearly to
us, this problem. You might see the grains of sand that the sandpiper
searches through in that little poem "Sandpiper" as, again, exemplary
of this problem in Bishop--that is, how do we hold onto, organize, and
find coherence in a world of discrete and shifting phenomena?</p>

<p>This is really the master problem that Bishop addresses very
self-consciously in this poem, "Over 2,000 Illustrations and a Complete
Concordance." Like "The Map," it's a poem that is in part about a
representation. She, by implication, begins the poem by referring to a
book, presumably the one mentioned in the title, "Over 2,000
Illustrations and a Complete Concordance." What kind of book is that?
She doesn't specify, but as the poem unfolds there's reason to believe
it's a Bible, I think--perhaps a family Bible. She says:</p>

<blockquote>Thus should have been our travels:<br />
 serious, engravable.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Our travels, our experience in the world, our experience of
geography, and our experience as geography should have been, ought to
be, serious. It ought to add up to something. I ought to be engravable,
something that might be bound in book form. The image of a book with
illustrations in a complete concordance holds up an idea that word and
image, perhaps word and flesh or representation and experience, might
be bound together in a coherent unity, might be shown to exist in
concordance or in some kind of correspondence.</p>

<p>Against this ideal or this model of things, where illustration and
text are bound together, Bishop poses her own wayward experience--her
travels--which this poem will list, record, and give us fragments of.
What the poem reveals to us is a world of discrete fragments, parts
that gain meaning, if at all, through their mere adjacency or through
the perceiver who holds them together--holds them together through the
quality of her attention and the sensibility behind it, a form of
attention for Bishop that is always pushing towards revelation and
seeking meaning or something beyond surface detail but never quite
arrives there and never, in that sense, arrives at a place of repose or
rest or home.</p>

<p>Let me read the second paragraph which brilliantly represents the
world brought into being by this poetics of geography.</p>

<blockquote>Entering the Narrows at St. Johns<br />
 the touching bleat of goats reached to the ship.<br />
 We glimpsed them, reddish, leaping up the cliffs<br />
 among the fog-soaked weeds and butter-and-eggs.<br />
 And at St. Peter's the wind blew and the sun shone madly.<br />
 Rapidly, purposefully, the Collegians marched in lines,<br />
 crisscrossing the great square with black, like ants.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>The poem is composed almost of the fragments of a travel diary or
bits of a letter, and if you read Bishop's letters you will indeed find
observations like this on every page.</p>

<blockquote>In Mexico the dead man lay<br />
 in a blue arcade; the dead volcanoes<br />
 glistened like Easter lilies.<br />
 The jukebox went on playing "Ay, Jalisco!"<br />
 And at Volubilis there were beautiful poppies<br />
 splitting the mosaics; the fat old guide made eyes.<br />
 In Dingle Harbor…</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And we jerk from one place to another, with each sentence one
country, one spot on the map.</p>

<blockquote>In Dingle Harbor a golden length of evening<br />
 the rotting hulks held up their dripping plush.<br />
 The Englishwoman poured tea, informing us<br />
 that the duchess was going to have a baby. [This is one of
Bishop's<br />
 provocative juxtapositions in the poem.]<br />
 And in the brothels of Marrakesh<br />
 the little pockmarked prostitutes<br />
 balanced their tea-trays on their heads<br />
 and did their belly-dances; flung themselves<br />
 naked and giggling against our knees,<br />
 asking for cigarettes. It was somewhere near there<br />
 I saw what frightened me most of all [implying, of course, that all of
these<br />
 scenes had frightened her]:<br />
 A holy grave, not looking particularly holy,<br />
 one of a group under a keyhole-arched stone baldaquin<br />
 open to every wind from the pink desert.<br />
 An open, gritty, marble trough, carved solid<br />
 with exhortation, yellowed<br />
 as scattered cattle-teeth;<br />
 half-filled with dust, not even the dust<br />
 of the poor prophet paynim who once lay there. [Just dust.]<br />
 In a smart burnoose Khadour [presumably their guide] looked on<br />
 amused.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Looking at this series, this way Bishop's life seems to add up, she
continues reflecting on the poem and on its structure.</p>

<blockquote>Everything only connected by "and" and "and."<br />
Open the book.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And we're back to the book now, that ideal form of representation in
which text and image are bound.</p>

<blockquote>(The gilt rubs off the edges<br />
 of the pages and pollinates the fingertips.)</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Bishop wants us--as in "The Map," too--she wants the book as
something that can be held and touched. She's a marvelously tactile
poet. Along with the unity of experience that it promises to give us is
a sense of intimacy, too, with an object.</p>

<blockquote>Open the heavy book [she says to us]. Why couldn't we have
seen<br />
 this old Nativity while we were at it?<br />
 -- the dark ajar, the rocks breaking with light,<br />
 an undisturbed, unbreathing flame,<br />
 colorless, sparkless, freely fed on straw,<br />
 and, lulled within, a family with pets,<br />
 -- and looked and looked our infant sight away.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>The Nativity is the scene of the Incarnation, that moment when the
Word is made flesh; Christmas morning, that moment when the divine
takes human form and so becomes present in the world. This is
specifically here, as Bishop imagines it, a scene of revelation. That
wonderful phrase, "the dark ajar"--as if the shadow were a door and you
could enter it; "the rocks breaking with light"--that which is solid
opening. What emerges is a flame, a sign of spirit.</p>

<p>But notice how in this light, the sacred is secularized. What Bishop
finds there is not the holy family but "a family with pets." There is
nostalgia here, in this poem, poignant and powerful; that is, a
nostalgia not so much for the holy as for the family once constituted
by their relation to the holy, the family with pets but also the family
that gathered around the book to look at them – a family gathered
through religious practice, who might then have "looked and looked our
infant sight away." In that, looking expresses a kind of primal longing
for community and for human connection--a longing expressed through
looking, importantly for Bishop, which is really what the poet is doing
in "The Map," I think, in the way that she invites us into her act of
looking in that poem. Here Bishop's nostalgia is sad but also resigned.
This Nativity is a scene that can be remembered and looked at from afar
but not entered into, as the belief system that it comes out of and
refers to can be looked at from afar but not entered into.</p>

<p>Bishop, as several people remarked in section this week, calls us
back in lots of different ways to Frost. Frost is perhaps an unusual
place to begin a course on modern poetry because--remember him? – he
really is generally an exception to the metropolitan scene and
inspiration of modern poetry. Modern poetry is a poetry of the city, of
the metropolis, of the world city, and of the place where the world's
peoples, goods, languages, traditions and cultures are all
"accessible," to use Marianne Moore's word from her poem "New York."
Pound, Eliot, Crane, Moore, Hughes, and even Williams and Stevens in
their somewhat different ways, are all poets of the metropolis. The
sense of ambivalence about modernity in these poets is an ambivalence
in many ways about the city and what it promises and also what it in
many ways threatens us with. Their sense of experience, their visions
of modernity and of modern forms of community are all located and
expressed there.</p>

<p>Frost aggressively defines his work against that context. In doing
this, he links his writing to nineteenth-century American writing and
art and links his writing to rural culture, which dominates the
nineteenth century. There is an anti-modern strain in Frost just as
there is in Yeats and, more complexly, in Pound and in Eliot. What's
modern about Frost is what has changed in the rural cultures that he
writes about; that is, the collapse of farming economies and
communities and the decay of nineteenth-century Protestantism, the
white church on the village green. You feel that loss in the terrific
aloneness of Frost's people. The great poem "Directive" is about all of
these things. Frost's poetry struggles to incorporate the secular
truths of modern science and to make poetry, like science, a
disenchanted knowledge. In this way, Frost has a lot in common with
Auden, and Frost, again like Auden, is fundamentally concerned with
poetry as a form of knowledge, a way to know the world.</p>

<p>At the same time, poetry preserves for Frost certain archaic,
primitive powers of enchantment: powers associated with primitive
motives and childhood experience that make it a crucial alternative to
science and scientific knowing. Think of the magic trick at the end of
"Directive" when Frost takes us to the ruined house of
nineteenth-century culture--the ruined farmhouse of "Home Burial"
maybe--and steals from the abandoned children's playhouse "a broken
drinking goblet like the Grail" and uses it to invite us to drink from
a primal source "too lofty and original to rage," that spring, and in
drinking to "be whole again beyond confusion." What are we drinking
there then at the end of Frost's poem, this poem published at the end
of the Second World War? We're drinking a kind of elemental power that
seems to fuse language and longing and imagination. This is, in Frost,
a conscious rewriting, I think, partially even a send-up as well as a
competition with Eliot in <i>The Waste Land</i> and the Grail myths
that are one of the central motifs of that poem: one of the central
motifs that embody for Eliot a sense of the holy, which is present,
however, for Eliot only through literary allusion, something
fascinating but unavailable as actual experience; something available
only, in a sense, as quotation.</p>

<p>Poetry in Frost, as in Eliot, does the work religion no longer does.
But notice how in Frost, in "Directive," the belief that poetry asks
from us is a belief in a fiction, in make-believe. And in this Frost is
strangely and wonderfully and surprisingly perhaps fully the
contemporary of Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane whose work proceeds from
that same assumption. Stevens's wartime poem "Asides on the Oboe"
begins:</p>

<blockquote>The prologues are over. It is a question, now,<br />
 Of final belief. So, say that final belief<br />
 Must be in a fiction. It is time to choose.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>This is the theme of Stevens's wartime masterpiece "Notes Towards a
Supreme Fiction." And notice the contradictory impulses in Stevens's
title. When poetry takes the place of religion for Stevens it presents
itself as a supreme fiction, a total representation of the world and
experience.</p>

<p>But we only have partial, provisional access to that fiction. What
Stevens gives us is merely notes – notes, something that Elizabeth
Bishop might present us with, too. In this sense, in Stevens the shift
from religion to poetry is also a shift from totalization, from system
to contingency and incompletion, to parts rather than a whole. For
Stevens, the disappearance of the Christian God as the center of
emotional, spiritual, cultural life is essentially, however, a cause
for celebration. In Eliot it's a cause for mourning--mourning and
anxiety, distress. In Yeats it's a cause of fascination and horror; in
Crane, for the making of new myths, new metaphors. Hughes's secular
poems are Christ-haunted. Christ and all of the iconography associated
with him is a source of hope and also irony for black culture and a
reproach to the white world.</p>

<p>How do people, how does culture find bearing in a world without
divine sanction? This is played out as an ethical question, a question
about how to live and act rightly in Moore and then later in Bishop. In
general, it is a less urgent question, a less central one in the later
poets than in the earlier ones. "Things fall apart; the centre cannot
hold," Yeats says in "The Second Coming." Bishop is fundamentally at
home in this condition, which is a condition of centerlessness or
homelessness. She liked the phrase "the world's an orphan's home" in
Moore. Bishop is at home then with a certain kind of homelessness.
Travel is her metaphor for the mobility of consciousness in a world
without a stable center. Her poetry is written from the disturbingly
and disorientingly decentered point of view that we find already in
those early poems of hers, a point of view that takes for granted the
absence of central authority that religion once provided. Remember in
"Over 2,000 Illustrations and a Complete Concordance" that holy grave?
It's not even particularly holy, she says. The place of the sacred in
Bishop has been vacated.</p>

<p>Might poetry fill it? This isn't a question Bishop asks or is
concerned with. But it is, as I've been suggesting, an urgent one in
many ways for the poets who preceded her. The poetry of the period 1920
through 1940, say--really the great phase of modern poetry-- this
period is structured, I think, by two big questions: how should poetry
be written and what can it do, what can it accomplish in the world? In
the first lecture I talked about these different impulses which are at
once opposing but also, I think, related and interlocking. I called one
of them formal and inward-turning, an aesthetic; the other rather
outward turning, concerned with the moral, the political, and the
social. The first one tends to limit the definition of poetry to say
what is particular to this art, to isolate what is essential to it. The
other works to extend poetry's scope, to give it an expanded role in
culture, in the world, and in our lives. You see different versions of
both of these impulses in the career trajectories of H.D. and William
Carlos Williams, who begin as masters of a certain kind of short poem
and go on to create epic poems of cultural sweep – H.D.'s being called
<i>Trilogy</i>, Williams's <i>Paterson</i>.</p>

<p>But the poet who more than any embodies these two impulses in the
shape of his career is Pound, of course: as I said, the author of the
shortest and the longest poem in modern poetry, the exponent of
Imagism, and the author of <i>The Cantos</i>. Imagism seems to want to
get outside of history, to explore the "sudden liberation… from space
limits and time limits," Pound says, in a kind of autonomous aesthetic
experience. <i>The Cantos</i>, however, are a poem, as Pound called it,
"including history": a poem of the greatest possible range and scope
and ambition.</p>

<p>In Imagism, there's an attempt to establish the primary poetic unit,
to cut away what is inessential, to find what is true. This is a kind
of formal program that expresses a drive towards truth telling that we
find in somewhat different terms in Frost and Auden and Moore. Think of
Frost's sense of fact versus, in "Mowing," the "easy gold at the hand
of fay or elf." Or think of Yeats's stylistic transformation as
expressed in that short poem "A Coat" or "The Fisherman," poems from
1915. Think about Moore's and Auden's severe revisions of their work,
in each case involving cutting out poems or cutting away many lines in
order to arrive at what Moore called, in "Poetry," that poem subjected
to severe revision, "the genuine." These are all creative acts of, I
think you could say, self-limitation and they're linked to the general
recurrent theme in these poets – in these poets in particular: Auden,
Moore, Frost – to the general theme of restraint or reticence. "The
deepest feeling always shows itself in silence; / not in silence, but
restraint." Remember Auden's stone god "that never was more reticent, /
always afraid to say more than he meant."</p>

<p>This impulse that I'm describing in modern poetry is also related to
formal experiments with restraint. You see this worked into Moore's
syllabics. Modern poetry in many ways seeks to restrain the singing
voice and the lyric voice of romantic poetry as received through
nineteenth-century poetry. Frost's vernacular, his will to get the
"sound of sense" into his poems functions in this way. So does Hughes's
vernacular, his black speech. Think about Eliot's syntactic and logical
discontinuities and disjunctions, the way they interrupt and fragment
lyric utterance, or think about Pound's incorporation of blocks of
prose, as he did in <i>The Cantos</i>. There is in all of these
examples a tendency to define what is modern in modern poetry by the
incorporation of traditionally non-poetic forms of speech and language
use and, moreover and importantly, non-traditional methods of
organizing poetic language. At the same time, this impulse can be seen
as a way not of limiting or curtailing poetry's scope, but rather the
opposite: expanding it, expanding it to include even, as Moore puts it,
"school-books and business documents," making poetry available for
people and cultures and experience that had not previously been
represented in poetry.</p>

<p>Other modern poetry is experimental in a very different way, indeed
in its revival and recovery and incorporation of historical poetic
forms. You could understand Hart Crane's reclaiming of Elizabethan and
nineteenth-century forms of ornamental rhetoric and versification as
exactly this kind of reclaiming of archaic materials. There's something
similar going on in Pound, in Pound's recovery of Provençal and
Anglo-Saxon verse forms, his revival of these forms. Pound and Crane
are both heroic poets. They answer that question – what can poetry do?
what can it effect in culture? – by saying simply "everything." That's
really the extraordinary presumption of their long poems – <i>The</i>
<i>Bridge</i> and <i>The Cantos</i>. They are very different poets,
however, and to some extent exposed – no, opposed figures, although
indeed their claim for poetry made them both exposed figures in
poignant and complicated ways. When I talk about their difference, I'm
thinking of Pound's suspicion of rhetoric, his suspicion of
representation, and his will or drive to get beyond these things versus
Crane's faith in rhetoric, faith in rhetoric and imagination, and their
power to transform the world.</p>

<p>In a sense, you couldn't have two more different poets. But both of
these poets take poetry as a kind of metaphor, as not only a metaphor
but as the salient instance, of the creative impulse in history. What
makes history happen? What makes action in history? And they place
poetry at the center of all that is most important that we do. They
both propose that poetry can fulfill the central mediating functions
that religion once did.</p>

<p>Pound and Crane become cautionary figures for later poets. To some
extent Yeats does, too; that is, figures who seem to show the limits of
poetry precisely in their efforts to expand them. This is one way we
can understand Bishop's poem, "Visits to St. Elizabeth's" on page 133.
This is a poem that describes Bishop's periodic visits to Ezra Pound in
St. Elizabeths Hospital where Pound was institutionalized,
incarcerated, after his return to the United States on charges of
treason. Bishop was living in Washington as the Poetry Consultant to
the Librarian of Congress and it befell her almost as an official duty
to visit Pound, hear him talk, and bring people to Pound, and it became
the occasion for this poem built on the form of "This is the House that
Jack Built." This is the poetry that Jack made.</p>

<blockquote>This is the house of Bedlam.<br />
<br />
This is the man<br />
 that lies in the house of Bedlam.<br />
<br />
This is the time<br />
 of the tragic man<br />
 that lies in the house of Bedlam.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And she continues adding, each time adding and, of course, in
Bishop's distinctive manner not only repeating but revising the terms
that she's given us; again, a poetics of constant readjustment. As the
poem builds, characters are included, not only Pound but Pound
represented as the man but also a soldier, a boy, and a Jew, figures
that are versions of Pound perhaps, reaching a climax in the final
stanza:</p>

<blockquote>This is the soldier home from the war. [Perhaps that's
Pound in some<br />
 sense.]<br />
 These are the years and the walls and the door<br />
 that shut on a boy that pats the floor<br />
 to see if the world is round or flat. [Again, Bishop touching a
map.]<br />
 This is a Jew in a newspaper hat<br />
 that dances carefully down the ward,<br />
 walking the plank of a coffin board<br />
 with the crazy sailor<br />
 that shows his watch<br />
 that tells the time<br />
 of the wretched man<br />
 who lies in the house of Bedlam.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It's a great poem. I spoke of Auden's and Bishop's perspectivism.
Here, Bishop gives us multiple perspectives on Pound and by extension
on the social and political ambitions of modernist poetry. Pound is
"tragic," "talkative," "honored," "old," "brave," "cranky," "cruel,"
and finally simply "wretched" – a word that comes from "The
Seafarer."</p>

<p>Arguably, one strain of modern poetry ends here in 1950 in the
madhouse, in Bedlam. Importantly though, it is not that Bishop stands
apart form, in a position to judge, Pound. Instead, she is
interestingly, I think, implicated in the scene. She must have enjoyed,
and by her choice of title calls attention to, the irony that Pound is
in a madhouse that has the same name as Bishop. In Bishop's great war
poem "Roosters," there is a sense that to oppose conflict out in the
world one must encounter conflict in oneself. Here, too, I think in
multiple ways Bishop implicates herself in the objects of her critique
and satire.</p>

<p>The child's verse form, it's important. Bishop identifies with, I
think it's fair to say – she's certainly interested in – children,
throughout her poetry. This interest points, I think, to Bishop's sense
of herself as a minor poet; that is, a mapmaker, not a historian; a
poet who refuses to write the major, culturally central, aggressively
ambitious poetry to which modernism and, above all, the poetry of Pound
aspired. Auden's perspectivism in "Musée des Beaux Arts" seems to
position the poet and poetry similarly. So does that famous statement
in the Yeats elegy, "For poetry makes nothing happen." These poems,
"Musée des Beaux Arts" and "In Memory of W.B. Yeats," read like rebukes
to modern poetry's promethean ambitions – its verticality, if you like
– and rebukes, too, to Auden's own political poetry of the 1930s,
exemplified by a poem like "Spain 1937."</p>

<p>But, as I stressed, Auden doesn't put a full stop on that sentence,
"For poetry makes nothing happen." Rather, he punctuates it with a
colon and continues, "it survives." There is perhaps a double
implication here. Either poetry does not have an effect on the world
but still survives, despite its lack of making something happen, or it
survives because it makes nothing happen. It is not a cause and it
doesn't take up causes effectively. What it does rather, as Auden
represents it here, is create a space: a space of happening, a
landscape, and a model of the world, seen in the same time as a valley
and a river, the river that flows through it.</p>

<p>There's terrific power of affirmation in this claim about poetry's
survival at the moment of Yeats's death, at the moment of the onset of
the Second World War when "all the dogs of Europe bark." Ultimately, in
Auden, poetry survives as "a way of happening," as he calls it, that
is, a "way" in a sense of both a method and a path; and implicitly, as
I suggested talking about this poem earlier; it survives as a kind of
open space, a place to come into to collect and gather in for us. And
it is figured, I think, finally and implicitly as a mouth, the human
mouth – open to speak old words and new words, too. Poetry survives in
my mouth and also in yours, which seems like a good last sentence to
end this course with. So, thank you very much.</p>
