<p><b>Professor Langdon Hammer</b>: Now, this is not only a course for
English majors, but for other majors too. The poets we'll be
reading--well, they knew about science, music, politics, economics, and
they presumed to talk about those things, in their poetry and out of
their poetry too. My lectures are going to presume no special knowledge
on your part. I see this as a course that's an introduction to the
literature of a period, to modern poetry. We'll be studying several
poets in some detail. The presumption is that they all reward and
demand a certain amount of close reading. At the same time, I do mean
to give you some sense of the period in which they're writing, some
sense of modernism as a field, as one of the richest fields in English
language writing. Finally, though, this really is a course in poetry,
plain and simple. I mean to introduce you to particular poems, to give
you ways to possess them, enjoy them, be puzzled or frustrated by them
too; to learn something from them and to care about them and to carry
them with you as you go forward after this class. So, that's a sense of
what I want to accomplish in these lectures. It will mean reading a lot
of poems and writing about them some.</p>

<p>The syllabus you'll see notes the general topic of each lecture and
the reading that I want you to have done for that day. There's a
Midterm. That will be a short answer test that's intended to give you a
chance to show how diligently you've been reading and coming to class.
The Final will include both a short answer component and then some
essay questions. There are two papers, a shorter and a slightly longer
one. The first paper is going to ask you to write about one short poem;
the second will ask you to write about two or more poems, or poems
perhaps by two authors, or perhaps a poem and some other kind of text
or image.</p>

<p>The teaching fellows in this course, I'm lucky to work with and you
are too. They are trained and have an interest in modern poetry, and
this is a happy collaboration for me with them. As I say, we'll start
to get our discussion sections organized on Monday and they should be
set, I hope, by the Wednesday lecture next week. I want you to come to
lecture on time. I did today, I started on time. I don't always do that
but I'd like to, and I can if you come at 11:30. Bring your books; I'm
going to be talking about the texts and I hope you'll have them open.
And of course you will come to your discussion sections in the same
state of joyful preparedness. As I say, the syllabuses should be
accessible on the Classsv2 server; however, I've had problems with that
in the past and you should please let me know if it's not.</p>

<p>There are just two books for the course; they're both at Labyrinth.
One is the first volume of <i>The Norton Anthology of Modern and
Contemporary Poetry, Third Edition</i>. It's edited by Jahan Ramazani,
formerly a Teaching Fellow in this course. There's also Elizabeth
Bishop's <i>Collected Poems</i>. There will be a packet that you can
order from RIS [copy center] that gathers a few supplementary readings.
There will be the visual images that I'm going to talk about in
lecture, and that I will make accessible to you on the class's server.
There are also audio recordings of the poets that we will be reading
that come from Sterling and you can get to on the Center for Language
Study website. All those things we can talk about more as the semester
develops, and I hope you will talk to me. You can do that on email, you
can do that in my office, which is downstairs on the first floor of
this building, in LC-109. You can catch me after lecture or before. We
can have lunch--all sorts of opportunities for talking, and I hope
you'll take advantage of it.</p>

<p>For Monday, we're going to start talking about Robert Frost, and I'd
like you to pay special attention to his poem "Mowing," in the RIS
packet, and to his poem "Birches" in <i>The Norton</i>. And as you
read, pay special attention to images of tools, work, play. Read
Frost's short poetic statement, prose poetic statement in <i>The
Norton</i> called "The Figure a Poem Makes." So, <i>The</i> <i>Norton
Anthology</i>, this book, this heavy book, I order it as a way to,
well, reduce your expenses. Here's just one big book to buy. It also
provides needed annotation. Modern poetry is in need of annotation.
This new edition of this old book is an excellent one. You should read
Jahan Ramazani's introduction, read his prose notes that preface his
various selections.</p>

<p>Having said that, there's really nothing so dead as <i>The Norton
Anthology</i>, or ponderous, and I do order it with a little--well,
some misgivings for that. The poems come to you abstracted from the
contexts in which they were originally produced and read, from their
place in a body of work, in a book, in a magazine, in a life that
produced it. In order to counteract the packaged and monumental form of
<i>The Norton</i>, I will be using Beinecke's [Yale library for rare
books and manuscripts] and Sterling's [Yale's main library] resources,
using Power Point digitized files. This will allow me to project images
in class and for you to look at them later at home. There'll be files
for not all but most of the poets that we discuss, and the aim is to
give you some sense through those images of modern poetry in its
historical, material dimensions, to represent it as something that was
lived, and in many ways is living now.</p>

<p>Now, the poems that you'll be reading, we'll be talking about, did
not, of course, always exist in the form that you find them. Their
first form was very often a manuscript. If you go to Beinecke, you can
find – and we will go to Beinecke, those of you who want to come with
me – and look at manuscripts that were early versions of texts that you
now find in <i>The Norton</i> and other books. When poems that had gone
through their processes of revision and so forth and came to
publication, they very often were published first, not in book form
certainly, but rather in Little Magazines that are now more or less
lost to us today but were in fact the essential vehicle for the
creation of modern poetry.</p>

<p>What is a Little Magazine? Well, very often they were big – big in
format and size. They were little because their circulation was small.
These were the funded-on-a-shoestring magazines that rose up and very
frequently faded away just as quickly in the 1910s and 1920s, and that
were in many cases the first avenue of publication for Stevens, Eliot,
Moore, the poets that you will be reading in this class. These
magazines were acutely aware of their differences from the popular
literary magazines of the nineteenth century, general interest popular
magazines of the twentieth century, magazines with wide circulation,
polite audiences. The Little Magazine was written by, addressed to, new
young writers and artists, and they were determined to make
trouble.</p>

<p>Nothing, I think, captures the nerve of these magazines like the
cover of <i>Blast</i>, which meant "kaboom," a magazine as a kind of
bomb, or maybe a curse-damn you, blast. Pound was one of the
contributors. Eliot's <i>Rhapsody on a Windy Night</i> appeared here in
this number of the magazine from July, 1915 in the midst of the First
World War; <i>Rogue</i> – another, also from 1915. Notice the price –
five cents. Stevens appeared here, in this magazine. You could contrast
the roguish and fanciful, clearly done by hand, title of the magazine,
with that machine-type <i>Blast</i>. Both of these are mischievous,
oppositional magazines but with very different styles and attitudes.
Here's another, <i>Broom</i>. This is a magazine just slightly later.
This is an issue of 1922. It's a cover by Ferdinand Léger; Hart Crane
would appear here. <i>Broom</i> meant to make a clean sweep of things,
a clean sweep of what had come before. It also clearly meant to have
fun doing it. Oops, I have gone too far. This is the back of the
magazine. I don't know how well you can make it out but there's a
little broom guy there with glasses, playing air guitar with his broom,
and I guess this is meant to capture the spirit of the
contributors.</p>

<p>Contrast that with the magazine that flashed there a moment ago,
<i>The Criterion</i>. This is a long way from <i>Broom</i>. This is
October 1922, comes out just before <i>Broom</i> is created. Here
you've got a magazine that doesn't present itself as attacking anything
at all, but rather as what? As setting the standard, <i>The
Criterion</i>. It looks official, doesn't it? The editor is T.S. Eliot.
This is the first number of the magazine. The magazine, in many ways,
announced and facilitated Eliot's rise to a kind of cultural authority
as a taste maker, and with it certain ideas of modernism. This issue
here, October 1922, includes <i>The Waste Land</i> by T.S. Eliot. It
also includes a little bit further down the page of review and essay by
Valerie Larbeau on a new novel by James Joyce called <i>Ulysses</i>.
That's some sense of the spectrum of magazines that are coming out, and
all with different roles to play in this culture and that position
their writers and poets and artists associated with them in different
ways.</p>

<p>Book publication can be just as interesting and it can tell us just
as much about modern poetry as magazines. This is <i>The Wind Among the
Reeds</i>, author William Butler Yeats, the year 1899, on the verge of
the new century. It's a beautiful book. It's a book that wants to be
beautiful, that's happy to be beautiful. It's rich in color and
texture. It's designed, embossed, gilt. It's self-consciously Irish,
Celtic. There's a sense that you're supposed to leave the bookstore
with a kind of talisman that you have bought, with a Celtic charm.
Contrast this book, <i>Prufrock and Other Observations</i>, the
subtitle left off here of the cover of T.S. Eliot's great book,
published in 1917. This is a different object, isn't it? Severe,
unsentimental, dry, so much so as to be maybe even a little bit funny.
And you laughed, right, and I think you're supposed to. It's not
entirely serious, even as it declares its seriousness. If Yeats's book
was so explicitly Irish, look at this book. It has no observable
nationality at all, does it? A certain kind of, well, you might say
impersonality. Its rhetoric is so flat and unemotional, so overtly
unrhetorical. It is, in fact, a very deliberate and self-conscious
repudiation of that late romantic aesthetic that Yeats's early book,
and even the cover of that early book, represents. <i>Prufrock</i>
isn't beautiful and its author is not a bard.</p>

<p>Another book, another book cover, <i>The Weary Blues,</i> by
Langston Hughes, 1926. Unlike <i>Prufrock</i>, this one is full of
color and of course it is the work of a poet of color. The image
presents the book not as a work of poetry at all but rather as a kind
of music, as a book of Blues, and it associates its poet singer with
honky-tonk piano players; not <i>Broom</i>'s bohemian egghead air
guitarist, but another kind of vernacular, another kind of celebration
and another kind of music. It makes us think about black artists
playing for a living in Prohibition Era back rooms.</p>

<p>Now, poems, like books, project an image of the poet who produces
them. While the poet is creating her or his poems, the poet is also
creating a poet, a certain figure of the poet, a public image of the
poet. And this is an evolving project, a work in progress. That's part
of the work and part of the subject and part of what I will be talking
about here. Let's look, for example, at a series of photos of Ezra
Pound. Together, they tell a kind of encapsulated history of this
central, fascinating, problematic poet's career. He begins as an
aesthete. This is 1913, Pound in London, styling himself, isn't he,
after those Renaissance artists and poets whom he would write about,
translate in this period. It could be a miniature worn by a Provencal
damsel, no? Well, here he is a little later, Pound after the war in
1923, sort of full flower of modernism, still a young man but he's got
that cane, and he's in Paris where he would meet Eliot and work on
<i>The Waste Land</i> with him.</p>

<p>Well, fast forward twenty years. This is Pound, Pound accused of
treason; Pound accused of treason by his country, accused of treason as
he tries to bend the world to his vision of it, and he escapes trial
only by reason of insanity when he is brought from Italy under charges
of having made broadcasts on fascist radio, back to the United States,
after an ordeal in a cage in Pisa. And he poses for this photo as an
intake photo as he enters St. Elizabeth's Hospital for the Insane in
Washington. In this final photo from 1971, back in Italy in Rapallo,
well, here's Pound presenting us with an image of something that would
have seemed impossible when he began, which is an image of modernism
grown old, old and blasted, in many senses. Contrast this career,
encapsulated in those images, with this one.</p>

<p>Who's this? This is the author of <i>Prufrock</i>. In fact, this is
the Harvard student who wrote <i>Prufrock</i>; Eliot wrote
<i>Prufrock</i> largely when still at Harvard and in the years
immediately following. Sexy? A little, maybe; those full, slightly
parted lips, that windswept hair, the general J. Crew look. Notice the
handkerchief. Here's the editor, great editor of the publisher Faber
&amp; Faber, thirty years later, or more, surrounded by books, the
cultural arbiter of the English speaking world; T.S. Eliot at sixty.
That hair is now slicked down, there are glasses between him and us.
This is the young man who's become a monument. But really, the
costume's the same one, right? There's the handkerchief. Pound's
descent into infamy and insanity and indignity and Eliot's rise to the
extraordinary cultural power and prestige that he occupied and that is
represented by this and many other photos, well, these are key stories
in modern poetry and they're interestingly interlocking, just as their
two lives were.</p>

<p>Another modern poet. This is an old woman called Marianne Moore who
became a kind of civic icon, who became a celebrity even, as an
eccentric New Yorker who wore tri-cornered hats and went to baseball
games and the zoo, and here appears in, well, her hair braided and
wrapped around her head; fanciful, virginal, kindly, safely out of
fashion, full of a kind of civic virtue, the embodiment of a certain
kind of popular idea of poetry. And you can't read it but there's a
kind of stamp of approval here from the governor Nelson Rockefeller.
Think of how far away this is from Ezra Pound in St. Elizabeth's
Hospital. This is another image of modern poetry. But Moore's hair was
not always done up. This is the image of a child, also named Marianne
Moore, with delicious, prodigious locks. It reveals maybe a little bit
of the power and extravagance and glory that you feel in her poems but
that she preferred always to restrain and bind and control in
extraordinary ways, and not always to hide.</p>

<p>One of the enduring works written in 1922, the amazing year that
<i>The Waste Land</i> and <i>Ulysses</i> appeared and <i>The
Criterion</i> started its publication--one of those amazing works is
Marianne Moore's poem called <i>Poetry</i>. You've got a sample of it
on your handout. Moore, who revised her poems, just the same way she
ended up binding her hair, republished this poem eventually in short
form, very short, where three pages were reduced to two sentences. The
first two sentences you see:</p>

<blockquote>I, too, dislike it: there are things important<br />
 beyond all this fiddle.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers
in it after all, a place for the genuine. Some of what she cut out of
the poem, cut out of its later version, is a list of what she had in
mind as the genuine, as examples of it, which is the first quotation
there; again, on your handout:</p>

<blockquote>The bat, holding on upside down [and so on]<br />
 A flea, the base-<br />
 ball fan, the statistician--<br />
 nor is it valid<br />
 to discriminate against "business documents and<br />
 school-books"; all of these phenomena are important.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>The drive to include the world--Moore's omnivorous poems claim for
poetry all the subjects that she mentions here and indeed many, many
more. All these are new, modern subjects. Because they represent
dimensions of experience formerly excluded from the elevated, idealized
discourse that is poetry, dimensions of experience excluded as prosaic.
Moore is quoting here in that phrase "business documents and
school-books," as she tells us, from Tolstoy, a prose writer. But she
goes further than Tolstoy in her commitment to the seemingly
non-poetic. She will not only include Tolstoy's prose, she will not
even discriminate against business documents and school books. Moore
exemplifies in this way a key aspect of modern poetry--its radical
heterogeneity, its will to mix many kinds of materials and discourses,
to make poetry reach out from the rarified and limited domain of the
poetic to keep including more and more of the world.</p>

<p>The next quotation on your handout--this is another example of this.
I won't sing for you or give you my Italian, but these famous lines,
"London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down" and so on,
these come from the conclusion to <i>The Waste Land</i>. They thrust
together different texts, different languages, writing from different
historical periods, all there, compressed in that remarkable mad song
that concludes the poem. In the next quotation, Eliot tells us that a
various and complex civilization, such as ours, produces, he says,
various and complex results, as if inevitably, lest we think that
there's anything particularly forced or outlandish or willful about his
own remarkable poetry in lines such as those I just quoted for you.
Eliot was there, in that essay on the metaphysical poets that I'm
quoting from, defending as necessary what is the primary
characteristic, not only of his own poetry, but really of modern poetry
generally, what is often called its difficulty.</p>

<p>Whatever else it may be, everyone's always agreed that modern poetry
is difficult. You will probably too. By "difficult," it is meant, I
think, well, first of all that it is in some sense set apart from
common speech, as a specialized and highly self-conscious use of
language. Eliot would go further and say that there is no common form
of modern speech, and that's the problem. According to Eliot, the
modern world lacks a center, a kind of set of collective beliefs and
commitments that would enable communication between us. Modernity for
Eliot, as for Moore, as for Pound, is marked by a profusion of
languages, both national languages such as French or Russian, which
turn up in <i>The Waste Land</i>; also, a bewildering array of
specialized types of discourse, technical genres, varieties of speech,
business documents and school books. There's an extraordinary sense of
verbal chaos, a kind of word hoard that modern poetry and
modernism--generally, a kind of linguistic environment of great
complexity from which modern poetry and modernism emerge.</p>

<p>This is an image called "Rotterdam" by the artist Edward Wadsworth.
It's a woodcut image from <i>Blast</i>. I like it because it's a kind
of image of the modern city that makes the modern city look like
language, look like letters, look like a kind of scattered alphabet, a
kind of babble. It's a kind of picture for me of the linguistic
environment, if you will, of modern poetry. Behind this environment are
the great social processes of migration and modernization that produced
that new urban form, the metropolis. All of the poets we read, even
that New England hayseed, Robert Frost, begin their careers in
metropolitan centers, primarily in London and New York. "All that is
solid melts into air," Karl Marx said, evoking the accelerating
transformation of modern economic and social life. The metropolis is
the center of this unsettled world that Marx describes. Coming to the
metropolis a hundred or ninety years ago now entailed, for the writers
that we'll be reading, as much as for anyone else, a kind of break with
a world that they had known, a break either with a native language –
this is what the emigrant or the expatriate experiences – or perhaps
with native ways of speaking and knowing, familiar spheres of
reference.</p>

<p>Life in the modern metropolis was de-familiarizing. It
de-naturalized language. Where there are many languages in use,
language comes to seem arbitrary rather than natural, as the product of
convention; not as something you're simply born into but something that
you learn, something that is made and that can be remade. This is a
presumption of all the poets we'll be reading. Modern American writers
and artists immigrated famously to London, to Paris. Another key event
in the making of modernism is the great migration of African-Americans
from the rural south to the urban north. Langston Hughes's poetry comes
out of this experience in a community of black intellectuals and
artists it created specifically in Harlem. And you'll see on your
handout two quotations from poems by Hughes, the first,
"125<sup>th</sup> Street," giving us well, here, images of black life
in the rural south transposed to Harlem. There's in those images, I
think, a kind of utopian promise that the familiar, ordinary pleasures
of rural life can be recaptured in a new society of plenty. But there's
also something hallucinatory and troubling about those images and
vaguely disturbing that's brought out, I think, in the related, famous
poem, "Harlem," on the next side of the page where if we've had faces
as food in the first text, something possibly reassuring, those faces
begin to look like dangerous objectifications in the second one where
that raisin in the sun threatens to explode.</p>

<p>Metropolis is, in modern poetry, set against a backdrop of war and
violence and conflict, and modern poetry, as it absorbs the world of
the metropolis, absorbs that violence and energy as well. The
metropolis, well, it's a place of ambivalence, a place of promise and
of threat, of exultation and also of dread. This ambivalence that I'm
describing is at the center of modern literature generally. And the
metropolis is crowded with language, crowded with faces, but there's
also a pervasive sense of absence and of loneliness and of loss
captured also again paradigmatically in <i>The Waste Land</i>, and I've
included there more lines from that poem. "The nymphs are departed,"
Eliot says. Eliot's speaking of a spiritual and imaginative state.
Modern poetry arises, in Eliot's case, with the death of God, with the
loss of a theological justification for life, with a sense of
disenchantment, a sense of depletion, depletion of meaning and value.
The metropolis which uproots people, takes them away, takes them out of
traditional cultures, also uproots traditional religious belief and
practices.</p>

<p>Eliot's poetry, the poetry he created out of this experience, is a
poetry of spiritual agony. Modernity is, in his work, a condition of
social and psychological fragmentation which is both a private,
personal dilemma and a public one, as he understands it. Compare to
Eliot's city, Eliot's sense of the city, this one. This is a photograph
by Alfred Stieglitz, <i>City of Ambition</i>. This is the modern city,
not as a scene of fragmentation or despair, but rather a place of
ascent and aspiration. It's also a scene of crossings, bridging past
and future. This is a photo by another American photographer, Walker
Evans, a photo of Brooklyn Bridge. You recognize it. And here is
another, another image by Evans of the bridge. This one comes from a
page of Hart Crane's epic poem <i>The</i> <i>Bridge</i>, and a book
that you can go find at the Beinecke, a remarkable edition of Crane's
poem where Evans's photos, grand photos, appear as almost miniature
images surrounded by white space, as you get some sense in this
image.</p>

<p>In Crane, in his great poem <i>The Bridge</i>- and here's another
photo by Evans, this time of Crane on the rooftop of the apartment
building in Brooklyn, 110 Columbia Heights where he lived and where he
began the poem, with the bridge in the background. In Crane, the
emphasis is not on what is lost in modernity but what is found or what
might be. Here's another quotation from your handout, number 7:</p>

<blockquote>New thresholds, new anatomies, wine talons<br />
 Build freedom up about me and distill<br />
 This competence to travel in a tier<br />
 Sparkling alone within another's will.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Modern poetry is difficult and these are difficult lines. "New
thresholds, new anatomies", well, that's not such a hard concept;
that's an image of what the modern promises for Crane, and indeed those
Gothic arches of the bridge seem to emblematize for him. Yet, Crane's
poetry in those lines I just read really are difficult, just as Eliot
and Pound are difficult, but not because as in those poets Crane
presents us with obscure references or languages unknown to us, or
learned allusion. Instead, what's difficult in Crane is a kind of
compression in his writing. They show us a poet taking language apart
and putting it back together in new ways, new configurations, new
anatomies.</p>

<p>Crane is full of mixed metaphors; you're not supposed to mix your
metaphors and he does, all the time. "Wine talons," there's one. "Wine
talons," what are they? Well, think about it. Perhaps you too have felt
wine talons grip you unexpectedly sometime and carry you aloft. The
metaphor suggests ecstasy, the exaltation of modern life, that
aspiration imaged in Stieglitz too. It suggests that ecstasy is like
wine, and wine is like an eagle clasping you; it's prey in its claws.
And keep in mind when Crane wrote those lines too, it was illegal to
buy and sell wine in this country. modernity, in Crane's strange,
gorgeous poetry, is all about getting high, about elevation,
exultation. Crane was an alcoholic. And if you study this photo, you
can see the qualities of a man struggling with alcoholism. This
friendly and even dignified face has prematurely white hair. His cheeks
are veined. Being drunk became for Crane a kind of grim literalization
of the freedom that came with being modern; and that vision of freedom
is something that his poetry preserves for us and carries forward for
us and continues to give us as a gift.</p>

<p>Contrast his images of joyous or demonic assent with the images of
catastrophe, of descent, of collapse in Eliot, "London Bridge is
falling down." The decay of Christian belief and practice is not a loss
but rather an opportunity for poetry, in Crane. He says in <i>The
Bridge</i>, he asks the bridge to lend a myth to God, and he suggests
that this is something that every age must do because our names for God
are always metaphors, poems, something imagined, acts of speech. Crane
shares these general ideas with Wallace Stevens. This is Wallace
Stevens, Wallace Stevens who said, "Poetry is a means of redemption",
and meant it. Stevens began life as a choirboy and as a Christian, but
his work is all about replacing Christian theology with poetry. For
Stevens, when modernity takes away God what it does is unveil the
poet's Godlike powers, a power to create the world through imagination,
imagination which created God in the first place. In Stevens, modernity
shows us that the truth of religion was always a fiction, a
fundamentally poetic construction.</p>

<p>Stevens's world is secular and non-transcendental, and he is fully
at home in it, so much so that he lives the life of a bourgeois
businessman, as an executive of the Hartford Accident and Indemnity
Company, a great Connecticut burger and poet. Stevens celebrates the
bourgeois world over and over again in a poetry that is about and
itself enacts our perpetual recreation of reality through the mind and
its special medium – language. Stevens understands tragedy, but he is a
comic poet, a humanist who is concerned to preserve and exalt the
human. The relativity of truth, the profusion of languages, these
things that afflict Eliot are a source of faith for Stevens.</p>

<p>Modern poetry seeks absolutes, what Moore calls the genuine, what
Crane calls the myth of America, the voice of the thunder in Eliot;
Stevens's supreme fiction; Pound's <i>Cantos</i>, a poem that would, as
he intended, include history. Modern poetry is, in all these ways,
Promethean, astounding, arrogant, enormous, imprudent, visionary. But
it also contains other positions, alternatives that open those
over-sized cultural ambitions to critique, to imaginative alternatives
of many kinds. And these are suggested, I'll suggest briefly, by the
last two poets we'll read – W.H. Auden, to begin with here, pictured as
an Oxford undergraduate, ever cheeky, who has written on the side of
his photo, "The cerebral life would pay," dry, cool, pragmatic; and
Elizabeth Bishop, young in this glamorous George Platt Lynes photo.</p>

<p>While modern poetry in many of its forms strives to master reality,
Auden reminds us, there on your handout, cautiously, that poetry makes
nothing happen. While Stevens represents the poet as a kind of God,
Bishop sees the poet rather as a sandpiper, that little bird skittering
along the shore, not in control of the world but subject to it, subject
to its continual fluctuation and awesome powers. Bishop's sandpiper
poet, there in your handout, is obsessed with the mere details of
experience, those sand grains, quartz grains. Her aim is to get along
in a world that is dominated by shifting forces that can be registered
and reacted to by poetry, but not explained. This is, I think, really
also a version of poetic activity that has some sources in and has a
lot in common with Robert Frost's, as we will see on Monday. Thank
you.</p>
