<p><b>Professor Langdon Hammer</b>: Langston Hughes is our subject
today. Let's start with a poem you probably know. It's on page 687.
It's really the poem for which Hughes is perhaps most known and was
first known. He composed it when he was eighteen years old. It is "The
Negro Speaks of Rivers." You can see that it's dedicated to W.E.B.
Dubois. Dubois was the important leader and speaker who was the editor
of the magazine <i>The Crisis</i>, which published this poem. And
<i>The Crisis</i> had a circulation of 100,000 readers at least, if not
more, and is in that way quite a debut to have. And it put Hughes
immediately in a political magazine, in a race magazine, and in some
ways in a popular magazine, not one of the little magazines of
modernism.</p>

<blockquote>I've known rivers:<br />
 I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of
human<br />
 blood in human veins.<br />
<br />
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.<br />
<br />
I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.<br />
 I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.<br />
 I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.<br />
 I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down
to<br />
 New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy bosom turned all golden in the
sunset.<br />
<br />
I've known rivers:<br />
 Ancient, dusky rivers.<br />
<br />
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Hughes's speaker is a particularized voice, an "I," at the same time
that he is a general one, "The Negro." The Negro speaks of and for a
people, as a representative figure. Like Hart Crane, Hughes returns to
Walt Whitman, Walt Whitman in his ambition to speak of and for America.
At the same time, unlike Crane, Hughes takes on Whitman's versification
– Whitman's ways of making a line, his free verse, his paratactic style
in which things are listed – as opposed to Crane's crumpled and
condensed quatrains, stanzas. Here, the relation between the particular
and the general, between the individual and a type, is one of the
poem's subjects. It is a poem about knowledge, about identity, and
about history, too.</p>

<p>What the "I" knows is rivers. We learn just a few things about those
rivers. They are ancient as the world. They are primordial. They are
even, it seems, prior to the human in this sense, prior to human blood
which conventionally is a way of representing race, of speaking about
race. So, the rivers are older it seems than any race, and yet they're
also an image of racial blood and flowing.</p>

<p>Hughes is writing about a universal from a particular point of view.
The flowing of rivers is like the flowing of blood in the poem. And to
know them is to know what is under or inside particular racial
experience at the deepest level. In this sense, we might paraphrase
that title, "The Negro Speaks of Human Life and History, as The Negro
Has Known It." It's a poem concerned with human life and history, the
very most general terms of experience from the particular perspective
of the black speaker and from the perspective of black experience. As
the poem goes on, the rivers are named and localized in history: the
Euphrates, origin of civilization and the site of the Jewish captivity
in Babylon; the Congo evoking Africa and its people; the Nile, site of
the pyramids, those archetypal human monuments, fixed in place and
pointed to the sky and in that sense counter-posed to the flowing
river. Being The Negro here means knowing all of these places.</p>

<p>The poem begins interestingly in the perfect present tense: "I've
known," "I've known"; "My soul has grown." This is an interesting tense
that evokes simultaneously the past and the present, suggests a past
carried over and into the present. Then in that third stanza, the poem
shifts into the simple past: "I bathed," "I built," "I looked," "I
heard." The Mississippi, the line about the Mississippi, continues this
pattern but then in the middle of the line breaks out of it: "I heard
the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New
Orleans, and I've seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset."
There's a way in which the story of Lincoln and the freeing of the
slaves that Hughes gets to at that point seems to break out of the
particular and then reach into this perfect present tense to evoke some
kind of ongoing experience, moving from the past to the present again.
And then the poem goes back into that perfect present. There's a sense
of past action that is ongoing, and active, present in the poem.</p>

<p>The rivers, they're "deep," dark, "dusky." They also, at this
pivotal moment in the poem, turn "golden." The poem projects a view of
black history in which to be black means simultaneously to be the
product of black experience across history, at particular moments –
particular moments, particular times – and also involved in the deepest
trans-historical meanings of the human. The journey that the poem
describes links different times and places and ultimately white and
black when Lincoln, America's white President, goes down to New Orleans
and resolves to end slavery.</p>

<p>This is a remarkable poem for a young man to write. Let me hold up
this interesting photo for a second. This is a picture of Hughes still
in the mid-twenties when his work was just being read for the first
time. It's a remarkable poem, I think, for a young poet to begin with.
You could compare it to other early, sort of inaugurating or initiating
poems that we've talked about, such as Crane's "Legend" or "The Love
Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" and other sorts of entries into poetry. We
could compare its vision of the past, too, to that which we find in
perhaps Pound or Eliot, which leads me to this general question of how
do we place Langston Hughes in this course and more generally how do we
position the black language and experience in his work in the general
context of modern poetry?</p>

<p>Where else in this course does The Negro speak? Have you seen black
people or heard black voices in other poems? Blackness figures in
Frost, interestingly, as a kind of charged symbolic color but in a very
generalized way that isn't linked immediately to race, although it
certainly could be seen to in certain contexts. You could say the same
thing, I think, about Stevens; although, you do, in Stevens, encounter
certain black figures, including the word "nigger" in one poem. There's
no question, though, that in Stevens and in Frost, the poetry doesn't
aspire to, doesn't pretend to, represent the experience of African
Americans. Marianne Moore, whom we'll read soon, has a poem called
"Black Earth." When Ezra Pound read it, he wrote to her and asked,
since he didn't know – he had never met her – was she Ethiopian? This
is a truly crazy question but an interesting one. In this poem Moore
speaks about an elephant and from the point of view of an elephant in
ways that might seem to possibly speak for black people, but only on
the level of fable or allegory.</p>

<p>Crane comes closer. If you turn back a few pages in your anthology
to the Crane section, the first poem in that selection is called "Black
Tambourine." That's on page 607. That poem describes, again, a kind of
symbolic, generalized type of the black man as a figure trapped in what
Crane called a "mid-kingdom" in popular imagination – the mid-kingdom
between man and beast. Crane sees the black entertainer as a kind of
figure of the artist, something like his tramps, his wanderers, Charlie
Chaplin. Crane had initially intended to include in "The Bridge" a
section that was to be a dramatic monologue spoken by a Negro porter on
a train. That plan fell away, but there are still traces of that
intention in his section of the poem called "The River," which tries to
evoke aspects of black experience, to integrate jazz, blues, and
spirituals into Crane's poetry and make them part of the history that
"The Bridge" tells.</p>

<p>Crane might have had as one model for the inclusion of
African-American expressive forms, surprisingly, perhaps, Eliot. When
"O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag"--when that breaks into <i>The Waste
Land</i>, jazz and a distinctively African-American form also enter
Eliot's poem. Eliot was writing, however, from the point of view of
white Europe, and blacks tend not to figure in his poetry except
perhaps as figures of otherness, those perhaps hooded hoards that swarm
across the plains in <i>The Waste Land</i>. The Beinecke includes in
its Ezra Pound Papers an interesting selection of poems published with
Eliot's juvenilia not so long ago; a selection of poems that circulated
between Pound and Eliot and certain other friends, which are obscene
racist limericks that Eliot wrote about King Bolo and his big, black,
bastard queen. This, too, is part of Eliot's oeuvre, though not part of
the public form of it, and it's important information about at least
one way in which black life figured in the high modernist imagination
of Eliot and others.</p>

<p>Here's that photo I started to show a moment ago. I suppose Hughes
is the only modernist poet who begins as a busboy. This is a photo from
1925, taken at the Wardman Park Hotel for a newspaper story about
Hughes. Hughes had been, it seems, discovered by the poet Vachel
Lindsay, at lunch when Hughes, or so the anecdote goes, presented his
poems to Lindsay, and Lindsay, taken with them, went on to read them
that night at a reading Lindsay was giving. Of course, this was all
carefully orchestrated by Hughes. If he's a busboy, he is also a poet
and wants--he's really, in a sense, almost in costume there and posing
for the newspaper photos. But it's an interesting and important image
of the man Hughes was as he began to write poems like "The Negro Speaks
of Rivers."</p>

<p>If white poetry turns away from African-American people and their
experience in modernism, Hughes also himself intended to turn away from
white poetry. "The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain," that prose
piece I've asked you to read at the end of your anthology on page 964,
makes this argument very forcefully. It begins by Hughes contrasting
his own intention as an artist with that of one of the most promising
of the young Negro poets who, as Hughes interprets his ambition, wants
to be like a white poet and in that sense would like to be white.
Hughes is writing here about Countee Cullen, a rival artist whose work
you can sample on page 727 and following in your anthology. Hughes
wants to get out of the curious condition of wanting to "write white,"
so to speak, by redefining what it would mean to sing in poetry. On
page 965 he juxtaposes two black audiences: one what he calls
"self-styled 'high-class' Negroes," that represent bourgeois norms or
the aspiration to them and that seek what Hughes calls "Nordic"
culture; and he contrasts them rather to another expression of black
life with which he identifies himself.</p>

<blockquote>…[These] are the low-down folks, the so-called common
element, and they are the majority [he writes]--may the Lord be
praised! The people who have their nip of gin on Saturday nights and
are not too important to themselves or the community, or too well fed,
or too learned to watch the lazy world go round. They live on Seventh
Street in Washington or State Street in Chicago and they do not
particularly care whether they are like white folks or anybody else.
Their joy runs, bang! into ecstasy. Their religion soars to a shout.
Work maybe a little today, rest a little tomorrow. Play awhile. Sing
awhile. O, let's dance! These common people are not afraid of
spirituals as for a long time their more intellectual brethren were,
and jazz is their child.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And he continues. He juxtaposes ecstasy, shouting, and jazz against
what he calls here "American standardizations." They furnish a wealth
of colorful distinctive material for any artist because they still hold
their individuality, their individuality in the face of American
standardizations.</p>

<blockquote>And perhaps these common people will give to the world its
truly great Negro artist, the one who is not afraid to be himself [and
which I, Langston Hughes, aspire to be].</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>These are important statements. They show Hughes's ambitions; they
show him positioning himself in relation to another African-American
writer, other African-American audiences for culture. In making the
move that he is doing here – a move that's really deeply influential in
African-American literature and poetry, which as a whole descends from
Hughes rather than from Countee Cullen – Hughes is still, however,
doing something similar, after all, to the other modern poets we've
been reading in this course.</p>

<p>And I want to suggest some of the continuities between Hughes and
these other writers. Like Yeats, for example, Hughes wanted to be a
representative figure, to speak for a people; and we speak of the Irish
Renaissance just as we speak of the Harlem Renaissance, of which Hughes
was a central figure. Like Williams, like Moore, like Crane, and like
Frost also, Hughes was very conscious of being an American poet,
eschewing European examples, for the most part, and seeking to bring
into poetry lives and language that had not been seen previously as
poetic material. At the same time, like Pound and like Eliot, Hughes
was interested in a long historical view, and he makes links between
people of different times and places in what was a global vision, for
Hughes, of history. Like Crane, Hughes published his first book in
1926, <i>The Weary Blues</i>. Like Crane, Hughes is--you could call him
a second-generation modernist. He's consciously coming after figures
like Eliot and Pound, and Yeats and Frost for that matter. This book,
too, is published by Knopf, Alfred Knopf: publisher of Wallace
Stevens's first book, <i>Harmonium</i>. So, Hughes is, in that way,
very much part of the same New York poetry world in which Stevens and
Crane and others are appearing.</p>

<p>Like Frost, Hughes wanted to get vernacular speech into poetry, and
like Frost, Hughes for the most part did not write for Little
Magazines, but rather popular ones, as I was suggesting. In fact, both
Frost and Hughes went on to make a living in poetry, and they have a
kind of national fame, a general readership that really none of our
other poets did. Like Pound, like Yeats in the teens, Hughes is
interested in what he calls "a naked style," a kind of ascetic
aesthetic. Like the other poets we've been reading, Hughes is a city
poet. He's a metropolitan poet, and he styles himself, as we've just
seen, against middle-class tastes and norms and expectations. And
importantly, like the other moderns, he finds no consolation in
traditional religion, even while he sometimes works with spirituals and
often evokes Christian motifs in his poetry.</p>

<p>In all these ways, Hughes is, I think, helpful to read at this point
in the semester, partly because his affinities with the other moderns,
once you start to recognize them, help us to see a kind of whole
picture. But then, just having said that, we have to start talking
about Hughes's difference. If he is an American poet, he is just as
importantly an African-American poet. If he is an internationalist,
like Pound and Eliot, he's interested in the international struggle of
the worker and the oppressed races. This is Hughes writing about a
journey to Cuba that he made. He traveled, particularly in the
thirties, frequently as a kind of representative of black Americans
sponsored by left groups and traveled to, well, Soviet Russia, among
other places. If Hughes's style is stripped down and naked, it is used
to describe a people who have been stripped of dignity and identity. If
he's a city poet, he's not a poet of the village or of London, but
rather of Harlem. And if God has withdrawn from the world of Hughes's
poems, God has left people not to Eliotic despair and epistemological
anxiety, but rather to rape and murder.</p>

<p>You might remember the last presidential election. Do you remember
that? John Kerry, always in search of a theme, which he never quite
found, seized for a little while on the phrase, "Let America be America
again." Sounds good. It's the title of a poem by Langston Hughes which
Kerry also made note of when he referred to that, when he quoted
Hughes, which was resonant, which sounded good in all sorts of ways,
and which had the added advantage of letting Kerry quote a black
writer. But then, if you remember this, you will also remember that
pundits quickly pointed out that this was not a poem nostalgic for a
golden era of democracy but rather a protest poem about the inequities
of American history, and it was written by a leftist who had ties to
the Communist Party. Whoops.</p>

<p>This is Langston Hughes, and it's a Russian script on the left, and
there's Hughes in the middle, surrounded by a variety of comrades in
Russia in the '30s. And alas, this is not what John Kerry wanted to
project. Or here is Hughes with two Soviet soldiers, also from the
'30s. Hughes is much photographed in many different roles and public
scenes, and there's a vast archive of those papers at the Beinecke,
from which these images come. Although Hughes's reputation is a little
bit like Frost's in having this general readership – he's poet you
probably read even in elementary school – he poses all sorts of
political problems that Frost does not.</p>

<p>Well, here is Hughes with somebody else, someone more acceptable to
be photographed with: W.C. Handy, in some ways the father of the blues,
as he's called, and a close friend of Hughes's. Let me talk about
Hughes and the blues. Here's an image, an illustration of Hughes's poem
"Too Blue" by the African-American artist Jacob Lawrence. Hughes, from
<i>The Weary Blues</i> forward, frequently presents his poems as forms
of music as allied to, as identified with, as perhaps metaphorical
versions of African-American forms, particularly, but not only, the
blues. Later in his career, his readings would sometimes be accompanied
by music. In his best blues poems, Hughes is not trying to write words
for music, I don't think, but rather is trying to write poems that
allude to and let us hear in metaphorical ways the musical traditions
which they are drawn on, and the culture and experience from which they
come. Hughes at his most powerful uses musical forms, popular musical
forms, for effects of compression and to develop really complex
ironies, often through repetition, usually built out of the three-part
structures of the blues.</p>

<p>Let's look at the poem "Song for a Dark Girl" on page 691. Like many
of Hughes's poems, it's a simple poem in its structure, and yet that
simplicity conveys real verbal complexity. And the poem in its popular
mode nevertheless invites a kind of close reading that's demanded by
modernist poetry, which presents itself as compressed, imagistic,
difficult, and so on. Let's look at it.</p>

<blockquote>Way Down South in Dixie<br />
 (Break the heart of me)<br />
 They hung my black young lover<br />
 To a cross roads tree.<br />
<br />
Way Down South in Dixie<br />
 (Bruised body high in air)<br />
 I asked the white Lord Jesus<br />
 What was the use of prayer.<br />
<br />
Way Down South in Dixie<br />
 (Break the heart of me)<br />
 Love is a naked shadow<br />
 On a gnarled and naked tree.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>This is a song for a dark girl, suggesting at once words for her to
sing – a dramatic monologue – and also "for" in the sense of a kind of
homage or tribute to her. She is "dark." As in other Hughes poems, the
word here seems to mean "black," also "darkened": abused, grieving,
shadowed. It's all held there in that simple word. "Way Down South in
Dixie" is a line from the minstrel refrain. It's borrowed here and
adapted. "Dixie" is a kind of shorthand name for a system and history
of oppression in this poem, and the very jauntiness and pride of a
colloquial name like Dixie is played off of, here, the melancholy and
grief of the context.</p>

<p>That phrase "way down," that seems innocuous too, but isn't it
resonant as it is repeated and as we feel our way into the poem? It's
formulaic, but it suggests that we're going, that this poem happens,
somewhere deep and dark; somewhere away, down; somewhere in the heart,
in the heart of this system of oppression; but also, as it will turn
out, in "the heart of me," as the poem develops it. Here, the mere
phrase, "Way Down South in Dixie" and the mention of that name, calling
up the tune, summons a kind of a history of oppression that would
occlude the kind of story that Hughes wants to bring forward and tell
here. The minstrel phrase is taken up by here a speaker who suffers,
who is oppressed by this system of oppression, and she uses it to make
her own music.</p>

<p>As in other Hughes poems, repetition – the use of the refrain--makes
everything that happens seem inevitable. It evokes here repeated
actions, a kind of history of repeated acts. In general, in the case of
refrains, they function in a variety of ways. A refrain that comes last
in a verse unit would seem to convey the idea that, well, somehow
things always end this way. Here, what we have is an instance of what
we would call anaphora; that is, a refrain used to initiate a unit of
verse. And the refrain is the first line of these stanzas, and it seems
to suggest that this kind of story always begins the same way, "Way
Down in Dixie." This is the way into everything that's experienced
through the poem, everything that's said.</p>

<p>The parenthesis that comes then, repeated in the second line of each
of these stanzas, functions in an interesting way. It suggests, I
think, that what is being said in them is a kind of aside or some kind
of interior reflection or soliloquy, perhaps a voice that must be kept
inside. Does that first phrase, "Break the heart of me," refer to the
girl, to her lynched lover, or to the poet, reflecting on both?
Probably the answer is all three, held together in a system of
identification. That phrase, "the heart of me," is resonant. It is what
holds these three together, a kind of shared heart. It refers to the
"heart," meaning emotion, feeling, probably pride. But the phrase also
suggests simply the center: the heart of <i>me</i>, myself, my
identity.</p>

<p>"They," "They hung my black young lover / to a cross roads tree";
"they" is superbly vague, impersonal, plural, formulaic, dehumanized;
evoking a mob, a generalized body. Then there's that phrase, "a cross
roads tree." There are a lot of suggestions in it. First of all, it
evokes the tree of the cross, Christ's cross. Then the cross is also a
figure for, I think, the intersection of white and black, as it is in
the little poem called "Cross," on the page before; you could consult
that. And then, the crossroads is one of the central recurrent scenes
of the blues. It's where Robert Johnson, the bluesman, was said to have
made his pact with the devil. It is the place where choices are made,
where crisis occurs in a wandering and displaced life.</p>

<p>That second verse, "Way Down South in Dixie / bruised body high in
air / I asked the white Lord Jesus / what was the use of prayer"; now
the parenthesis holds in it a kind of brutal image, something
horrifying that must be set off slightly. The body is bruised, it shows
the marks of beating, of suffering, in advance of murder. It's lifted
high in air, not in honor or tribute. Rather, to be lifted in this way
is to lose all agency, to be made lifeless; all of this presented as a
kind of syntactic fragment in the poem, not yet integrated into the
poem, so to speak, or it may not yet be integrated into consciousness.
The final verse--we'll go back to it and interpret that image. Here
Jesus is white: in a sense a pure, untouched, redeemed; but also
because he is, it seems, a representative of white culture, a kind of
mediator the girl would seek to address. The girl doesn't pray to him
but rather asks a question, a question about the use of prayer, and
Jesus notably doesn't answer. In addition to repetition, song-form
poems like this are made out of omission and jumps from one stanza to
another, from one line to another. And one thing omitted here is any
sense of Jesus' reply.</p>

<p>Or perhaps the answer comes in the form of that final verse, which
repeats the first lines of the poem – this is the truth that it arises
from and returns to – and it gives us a memorable image. The lover has
become depersonalized and abstract, merely a shadow. He has now,
though, with his abstraction become love itself: the girl's love,
perhaps Christ's love. And "Love is a naked shadow / on a gnarled and
naked tree." Here the repetition of "naked" is suggestive. It evokes
the man's nakedness, his helplessness and exposure. There's also a
sense of revelation, of coming to the naked truth. And this is
something very different from the nakedness that Yeats boasts of in his
poems.</p>

<p>The blues is also about laughter, and it is laughter that, I guess,
I would like to end with while we have a few moments left, laughter
that comes out of the endurance of hardship and suffering. This is a
young Hughes laughing and here's a later one. And why don't we end with
a later poem, and that's called "Life is Fine," on page 699, twenty
years after the poems I've been discussing. It, too, has a song form
and a blues singer speaking to us:</p>

<blockquote>I went down to the river [and think of how many rivers
appear in these<br />
 poems]<br />
 I set down on the bank.<br />
 I tried to think but couldn't,<br />
 So I jumped in and sank.<br />
<br />
I came up once and hollered!<br />
 I came up twice and cried!<br />
 If that water hadn't a-been so cold<br />
 I might've sunk and died.<br />
<br />
<i>But it was<br />
</i><i>Cold in that water!<br />
</i><i>It was cold!</i></blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Suicide is contemplated and tried, not quite, because when the
singer gets on top of the building he decides, "<i>But it was / high up
there! / It was high!</i>" and he's not about to jump.</p>

<blockquote>Since I'm still here living,<br />
 I guess I will live on.<br />
 I could've died for love--<br />
 But for livin' I was born. [Not for love, because that would mean
dying.]<br />
<br />
You may hear me holler,<br />
 You may see me cry--<br />
 But I'll be dogged, sweet baby,<br />
<br />
If you gonna see me die.<br />
 <i>Life is fine!<br />
</i> <i>Fine as wine!</i><br />
<br />
Life is fine!</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Well, I think rather than say anything else, I'll stop right on time
and promise to return on Wednesday. We'll talk about William Carlos
Williams.</p>
