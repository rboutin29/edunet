<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: On Monday we--I presented an
introduction to evolutionary psychology, the looking at psychology from
an evolutionary perspective, and trying to make a case and give some
examples of how it can help illuminate and illustrate certain aspects
of how the mind works. One of the advantages of an evolutionary
perspective on the mind is that it forces us to look scientifically at
what we would otherwise take for granted. There are a lot of aspects of
how we are and what we are and what we do that seem so natural to us.
They come so instinctively and easily it's difficult, and sort of
unnatural, to step back and explore them scientifically but if we're
going to be scientists and look at the mind from a scientific
perspective we have to get a sort of distance from ourselves and ask
questions that other people would not normally think to ask. And the
clearest case of this arises with the emotions. And as a starting point
there's a lovely quote from the psychologist and philosopher William
James that I want to begin with. So, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>To the psychologist alone can such questions occur as: Why
do we smile when pleased and not scowl? Why are we unable to talk to a
crowd as we talk to a single friend? Why does a particular maiden turn
our wits upside down? The common man--[None of you are the common man.]
The common man can only say, "Of course we smile. Of course our heart
palpitates at the sight of the crowd. Of course we love the maiden. And
so probably does each animal feel about the particular things it tends
to do in the presence of certain objects. To the lion it is the lioness
which is made to be loved; to the bear the she-bear. To the broody hen,
the notion would probably seem monstrous that there should be a
creature in the world to whom a nestful of eggs was not utterly
fascinating and precious and never to be too-much-sat-upon object which
it is to her.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Now, there's a few things to note about this passage. First, it's
incredibly sexist. It assumes not just merely in reflexive use of
phrases. It assumes that--William James assumes he's talking to males,
male humans who sometimes take the perspective of male bears. And so,
it assumes a male audience. You wouldn't normally--You wouldn't
actually ever write this way. A second point is it's beautifully
written and you're not--;also, not allowed to write that way anymore
either. It's poetic and lyrical and if--William James
characteristically writes that way. I think he writes so much better
than his brother, Henry James, an obscure novelist. [laughter] Finally
though, the point that he makes is a terrific one, which is yes, all of
these things seem natural to us but the reason why they seem natural is
not because they are in some sense necessary or logical truths. Rather,
they emerge from contingent aspects of our biological nature.</p>

<p>And so we need to step back. We actually--We need to step back and
ask questions like--and these are questions we're going to ask--Why
does poop smell bad? Avoid the temptation to say, "Well, poop smells
bad because it's so stinky." The stinkiness of poop is not an
irreducible fact about the universe. Rather, the stinkiness of poop is
a fact about human psychology. To a dung beetle poop smells just fine.
Why does chocolate taste good? Well, chocolate--The good tastiness of
chocolate isn't some necessary fact about the world. It's a fact about
our minds that doesn't hold true for many other creatures. And so, we
have to step back and ask why to us do we find chocolate appealing?</p>

<p>Why do we love our children? Don't say they're lovable. Many of them
are not [laughter] and, as William James points out, every animal, most
animals, many animals love their children. They think their children
are precious and wonderful. Why? Why do we get angry when people hit
us? Suppose somebody walked up to you and slapped you in the face?
You'd be afraid. You'd be angry. Would you get sleepy, feel nostalgic,
suddenly desire some cold soup? [laughter] No. Those are stupid
alternatives. Of course if somebody slapped us you would--we would get
angry or afraid. Why? Why do we feel good when someone does us a favor?
Why don't we feel angry? Why don't we feel fearful? What we're going to
do throughout this course is step back and ask these questions. We're
going to ask questions nobody would have otherwise thought to ask,
where the common man wouldn't address, and this is, of course, standard
in all sciences.</p>

<p>The first step to insight is to ask questions like why do things
fall down and not up? And I imagine the first person who articulated
the question aloud probably met with the response saying, "What a
stupid question. Of course things fall down." Well, yes, of course
things fall down, but why? Why is our flesh warm? Why does water turn
solid when it gets cold? These are natural facts about the universe,
but the naturalness needs to be explained and not merely assumed. In
this class we're going to explore, throughout the course, what seems
natural to us and try to make sense of it. And to that end we have to
ask questions that you wouldn't normally ask. We've already done this
to some extent with domains such as visual perception, memory, language
and rationality, but now we're going to move to the case where it's
maybe even somewhat more difficult to do this. Now, we're going to
start dealing with the emotions. We're going to talk about the
emotions, why they exist, what they're there for, and how they
work.</p>

<p>I want to start off with the wrong theory of the emotions. And the
wrong theory of the emotions is beautifully illustrated in the
television and movie series <i>Star Trek</i>. In this alternative
fantasy world, there are characters, Mr. Spock in the original <i>Star
Trek</i>, Data in one of the spin-offs, who are described as competent,
capable, in fact in many ways, super competent and super capable
people. But they're described as not having emotions. Spock is
described as not having emotions because he's half Vulcan, from a
planet where they lack emotions. Data is an android who is said to lack
an emotion chip.</p>

<p>This lack of emotions on this--on a TV series does not hurt them
much. They're able to fully function. And in fact, in a TV series
emotions are often seen as a detriment. You do better off without them.
And there are many people in sort of common sense who might think "Gee,
if only I could just use my rationality, think reasonably and
rationally and not let my emotions guide my behavior I'd be much better
off." It turns out that this is a notion of how to think about the
emotions that is deeply wrong. And in fact, makes no sense at all.</p>

<p>Using the example of <i>Star Trek</i>, Steven Pinker, in his book
<i>How the Mind Works,</i> nicely illustrates the problem here. He
writes, "Spock must have been driven by some motives or goals.
Something must have led him to explore strange new worlds, to seek out
new civilizations and to boldly go where no man had gone before."
Presumably, it was intellectual curiosity that set him to drive and
solve problems. It was solidarity with his allies that led him to be
such a competent and brave officer. What would he have done if attacked
by a predator or an invading Klingon? Did he do a handstand, solve the
four-color map theorem? Presumably, a part of his brain quickly
mobilized his faculties to scope out how to flee and how to take steps
to avoid a vulnerable predicament in the future. That is, he had fear.
Spock did not walk around naked around the ship. Presumably, he felt
modesty. He got out of bed. Presumably, he had some ambitions and
drive. He engaged in conversations. Presumably, he had some sociable
interests.</p>

<p>Without emotions to drive us we would do nothing at all. And you
could illustrate this scientifically. Creatures like Spock and Data
don't exist in the real world but there are unusual and unfortunate
cases where people lose, to some extent or another, their emotions. And
you could look at these people and see what happens to them. The
classic case, the most famous case, is that of a man called Phineas
Gage. Phineas Gage is the classic Intro Psych example â€“ an extremely
poor guy, poor schmuck.</p>

<p>In 1848--He was a construction foreman. In 1848 he was working at a
site with explosives and iron rods. And due to an explosion, an iron
rod passed through his head like so. Imagine that rod shooting upwards.
It went under his eye and popped out the top of his head. It landed
about one hundred feet away covered with blood and brains. The rod
itself weighed thirteen pounds. Amazingly, Gage was not killed. In
fact, he was knocked unconscious only for a short period and then he
got up and his friends surrounded him and asked, "Are you okay?" And
they--And then they took him to the hospital. On the way to the
hospital, they stopped by a tavern and he had a little pint of cider to
drink, sat down and talked to people. And then he had an infection, had
to have surgery. But when it was all said and done he wasn't blind, he
wasn't deaf, didn't lose language, didn't become aphasic, no paralysis,
no retardation. In some sense, what happened was much worse. He lost
his character.</p>

<p>Here's a description at the time of what Gage was like. And this is
from Damasio's excellent book <i>Descartes' Error:</i></p>

<blockquote>He used to be a really responsible guy, a family man, very
reliable, very trustworthy. But after the accident he was fitful,
irreverent, indulging at times in the grossest profanity, manifesting
but little deference for his fellows, impatient of restraint or advice,
a child in his intellectual capacities and manifestations. He had the
animal pleasures of a strong man. His foul language is so debased that
women are advised not to stay long in his presence.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And he couldn't hold a job. He lost his family, couldn't hold a job.
He ended up in the circus. He was in the circus going around the
country with his big iron rod telling everybody the story as they
surrounded him and clapped. There are other cases like Phineas Gage,
cases where people have had damage to that same part of the brain,
parts of the frontal cortex. And what they've lost is they basically
lost a good part of their emotions. And what this means is they don't
really care that much about things. They can't prioritize.</p>

<p>Damasio tells a case of one of his patients who was under the
pseudonym here of Elliot. And Elliot had a tumor in his frontal lobe.
And the tumor had to be removed and with it came a lot of Elliot's
frontal lobe. And again, as a result of this, Elliot was not struck
blind or deaf or retarded, and he didn't become the sort of profane
character that Phineas Gage became, but he lost the ability to
prioritize. He lost the ability to set goals. Damasio describes him
here:</p>

<blockquote>At his job at an activity he would read and fully
understand the significance of the material [He works in an office.]
but the problem was he was likely, all of a sudden, to turn from the
task he had initiated to doing something else and spending an entire
day doing that. He might spend an entire afternoon deliberating on
which principle of categorization he should apply to files. Should it
be the date or the size of the document, pertinence to the case or
another?</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>He couldn't set his goals. He couldn't--He ended up not being able
to keep a job, not being able to deal with people. And these are not
men who have lost their emotions. There is no case around where you
could have your emotions entirely blotted out. But they lost a large
part of their emotional capacity and as a result, their rationality
failed.</p>

<p>Emotions set goals and establish priorities. And without them you
wouldn't do anything, you couldn't do anything. Your desire to come to
class to study, to go out with friends, to read a book, to raise a
family, to be--to do anything are priorities set by your emotions. Life
would be impossible without those emotions. And so, there's certain
themes we're going to explore here. The first is this, that emotions
are basically mechanisms that set goals and priorities and we're going
to talk a lot about--in this class and the next class about universals.
We're also going to talk about culture. It turns out that cultures,
different cultures, including differences between America and Japan and
the American South and the American North, have somewhat different
emotional triggers and emotional baselines to respond to. But at the
same time, as Darwin well knew, emotions have universal roots that are
shared across all humans and across many animals.</p>

<p>So, the agenda for this class and the next class is going to go like
this. First, I want to talk a little bit about facial expressions,
which are ways in which we communicate our emotions â€“ not the only way,
but an important way â€“ and look, in particular, at the case of smiling
because it's kind of interesting. Then I want to look at one case study
of a nonsocial emotion, that of fear. I want to then deal with feelings
towards our kin, people we're genetically related to, and then--and
this will take us to the next class, feelings towards non kin.</p>

<p>So first, faces. And as an introduction to faces I have a brief film
clip from Paul Ekman, who is one of the world's great scholars in the
study of facial expressions. [clip playing]</p>

<p>In Ekman's work, he presents us with instructions on how to make
different faces and identify faces. Ekman actually has a sort of more
practical career along with his scientific career. He trains police and
secret service members to try to figure out cues to honesty and
dishonesty. There's a very interesting <i>New Yorker</i> profile on him
by Malcolm Gladwell a few years ago, something you might be interested
in. But let's do one of his faces.</p>

<p>Please lower your brows and draw them together. That means even
those who aren't making eye contact with me now. Tense your lower and
upper eyelids. Don't pop out contact lenses but just tense them. Stare.
Your eyes can bulge somewhat. [laughter] Okay. Now, the last part is
important. Press your lips together with the corners straight or down.
That's good. You got it. [laughter] Okay. Just because you are not
making eye contact with me doesn't mean I can't see you. Okay.
[laughter] Well, what you're looking like presumably is this [referring
to a slide]. And what face is that? What emotion does that correspond
to? Anger.</p>

<p>There's all sorts of databases of different faces from around. This
guy--I don't know who he is but he seems to be on a lot of these things
[laughter] but the thing is you don't need to rely on him. You don't
need to rely on Western faces. Even if you go on line there's, by now,
a lot of databases from faces from all sorts of genders and national
origins. This is from a Japanese women facial expressions. And there
are some subtle and very interesting differences across countries and
across people, but there's also deep universals. You don't have to work
very hard to figure out what these different facial expressions
mean.</p>

<p>I want to give one more face example because I want to focus on this
a little bit. This one's a little bit easier. Raise the corners of your
lips back and up, please. [laughter] Raise your cheeks. Raise your
lower eyelids if you can. [laughter] They're smiling. You're smiling.
You can stop [laughter] smiling. Yale is actually really big on
smiling. We have two of the world's experts on smiling. This is Angus
Trumble, the curator at the British Art Gallery who wrote this
wonderful book, <i>A Brief History of the Smile</i> looking at the
smile in art. And this is my colleague, Marianne LaFrance, who is
actually not smiling in that picture but she studies smiling and
smiling in adults, smiling in children, smiling across cultures, and
the different social uses of smiling. And there are some interesting
discoveries people have made about smiles and about smiles and the
emotions.</p>

<p>One--Oh. Well, one is that smiles are universal. We know, for
instance, that young children smile. This is my son, Zachary, when he
was younger, not that weird-looking kid [laughs] next to him.
[laughter] Thank God. [laughter] And even blind children, children
blind from birth, will smile. They'll smile appropriately, making an
important point that smiling is not learned by looking at other
people's faces.</p>

<p>Smiling is also not uniquely human. Nonhuman primates smile as well.
Smiles are social signals. You might imagine that people smile when
they're happy. This is actually not the case. It's not as simple as
that. Rather, people smile when they wish to communicate happiness and
we know that from several studies. There are some studies of bowlers
and the studies are very nice. What they do is they film bowlers. So,
the bowlers do their bowling and sometimes they knock down all the
pins, which is called a what? A strike. So a strike--and that's good in
the bowling world. So, they knock down all the pins but what they don't
do, is they don't smile after they knock down the pins. They are being
filmed. They don't smile. Then they turn around to their friends and
give a big grin.</p>

<p>Other studies have looked at films of people who have just won
Olympic gold medals. Now, not surprisingly, people who have won Olympic
gold medals are very happy. This is good news to win an Olympic gold
medal. But they don't actually stand on the podium grinning. Rather,
they stand there with their faces in a normal expression. Then when
they stand up and face the crowds, there's a big smile. You can ask
yourself whether during sex, an activity where many people enjoy,
whether or not people smile during sex. And you can discover this
yourself with [laughter] a partner or a mirror. [laughter]</p>

<p>So, there are other things we know about smiles. There are different
types of smiles. There are actually quite a few different types of
smiles that are different in interesting ways. This is Paul Ekman
again. Which one's a better smile? Who votes for the one on the right?
Who votes for the one on the left? There are two different sorts of
smiles. The one on the right is a smile of greeting. It's sometimes
known as a "Pan Am" smile. Pan Am is a now defunct airline which had at
that time--They were--They don't call them stewardesses anymore but
they're--the stewardesses would come in and they would smile. That was
part of their job. But it was a big, fake smile, the Pan Am smile, a
smile to communicate "hello" and--but it's as opposed to a smile where
the communication is that of genuine happiness. The difference is
around the eyes. It's not the mouth. It's the eyes.</p>

<p>A real happiness smile, what's known as a Duchenne smile, after a
neurophysiologist who studied it, involves moving the eyes. What's
interesting is about only one out of every ten people can fake a
Duchenne smile. So, if you smile at somebody, and you just hate their
guts but you want to smile at them, it's--unless you're quite gifted
it's difficult to fake a really good, really happy smile.</p>

<p>You could--It's not difficult to study smiles in the real world. You
could look at politicians, for instance. Politicians are often in
contexts where they have to smile a lot. And what they do is they
simply give the Pan Am smile. The mouth moves up, particularly if
somebody is attacking their record or ridiculing them, and they'll
smile and--but it's not a sincere smile. The eyes don't move.</p>

<p>My favorite example of this was a few years ago when there was a
huge battle for the House majority leader. And a guy named--a
Republican named John Boehner won this position in quite a heated
battle. And they took a picture of the guy--This is not very nice. They
took a picture of the guy, Roy Blunt, as he stepped out. And he had
lost and this was his expression. [laughter] And he's not really very
happy [laughter] as opposed to a smile like this, which is a real
smile.</p>

<p>So, you have two sorts of smiles: A real happiness smile [or] a
Duchenne smile--called--also known as the Duchenne smile, and then a
Pan Am smile, or greeting smile. And you'll use each of those smiles at
different points in your day and in your life. It turns out that these
different smiles have real psychological validity. They seem to sort of
reflect deep differences in your mood and emotions and thoughts.
Ten-month-olds, for instance, give different sorts of smiles. When
their mother approaches there they give a real happiness smile. Then
when a stranger approaches or someone else approaches there they'll
tend to give more of a greeting smile.</p>

<p>John Gottman studied married couples. And John Gottman does a lot of
work--Well, what he does is he looks at film clips of couples. And by
analyzing the film clips he tries to predict will their marriages
survive. And one of his cues--There's different cues. Incidentally,
sort of side topic: The death knell for a marriage for Gottman--This is
his big finding. It's not if they fight a lot. It's not they scream at
each other. It's not even if they hate each other. The death knell of a
marriage is contempt. And so, if he shows these clips: I walk in,
"Honey, I'm home," and my spouse has the look of contempt, it's a bad
sign. [laughter] But another clue is the sort of smiles they give when
they see each other when they walk into the lab. If it's a true
happiness smile, that's actually bodes better for the relationship than
a Pan Am, or greeting smile.</p>

<p>Finally, studies have been done of college yearbook photos looking
at people thirty years later. And it turns out that there's a
correlation, a reliable relationship between how happy somebody is now
and back thirty years ago in their yearbook photo--what sort of smile
they're giving.</p>

<p>There is some evidence for a third sort of smile. This is known as a
coy smile or an appeasement smile. This is sort of a very specialized
sort of smile. This is a smile of embarrassment or stress. You give it
when you want people to like you, you want to join in; you want to make
people feel positive about you. But you're in, sort of, a high-stress
situation often with some sort of risk. And what you do is you sort of
you turn away. There's no eye contact. You turn away and kind of give
this-- [demonstrating by tilting his head to the side]</p>

<p>And this actually shows up in other primates. Here's a nice picture.
[laughter] So, the rhesus monkey bites her own infant, and the infant
gives a scream and then the submissive, coy smile. And it also shows up
in human infants. Here's a nice clip of a coy baby smile. I'll walk you
through it. The baby is being approached, [laughter] goes like this
[with locked-gaze the brows raise and a smile starts], smiles like this
[smile widens and head turns up a left], and then the aversion [smile
widens and head is further averted]. Yeah. Babies are cute. [laughter]
Any questions at this point about smiling? What are your smiling
questions? [laughter] Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Do nonhuman primates' smiles [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> That's a good question. I don't know.
There's evidence that the coy smile shows up in non--The question was,
"Do nonhuman primates give the same smiles that humans do?" such as a
distinction between the Pan Am smile, a greeting smile, versus a
genuine smile of happiness? I don't know. I'll find out for you for
next class though. That's a good question. Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> How come some people's smiles are better than other
people's smiles?</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> How come some people's smiles are
better than other people's smiles? The non-interesting psychological
answer, some people are better looking and there's more thing--
[laughter] but the deeper answer is some people are better able to
smile. Some people are better able to use the cues to express true
happiness.</p>

<p>There's something else about smiles which is going to come up, which
your question raises, I think, which is going to come up in--when we
talk about emotional contagion and actually, some issues of morality.
Smiles are extremely contagious. So, what I'd like people to do--If
you're sitting next to somebody, please turn around and find someone
next to you and look at them. Don't do anything. Just look at them.
Whoever is being looked at, look back. [laughter] This is not--
[laughter] Please arbitrarily decide. Okay. Please arbitrarily decide
on the smiler. That will be--No, not at me, at each other, [laughter]
and that will be the person--If you are unable to resolve this
dispute--yes, you two, please--if you are unable to resolve this
dispute, the person to the right of me will be the smiler. So, look at
each other expressionless. [laughter] Now, the person who is the
mandated smiler, [laughter] on three, please smile. One, two, three.
[laughter] Okay. [laughter]</p>

<p>Worst class demo ever [laughter] but if one could imagine more
restrained circumstances, it is actually extremely difficult to be
facing somebody who's really smiling at you and not smile. This is
true, by the way, for virtually every other emotion. The phenomena is
known as "emotional contagion," where if you're facing somebody, for
instance, and they're--they look at you in a face of absolute rage, it
is very difficult to just sit there without your own face molding in
accord to their own. And the reasons why this happens and how that
works is something we'll talk about later on. So that's--One more
question. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> I don't know if that's--The question
is, "Is there a difference between smiling with your teeth versus just
your lips closed?" There probably is. That's not a main smile
difference but my bet is that there probably is a difference. And my
bet also is that that sort of distinction, how much teeth you show when
you smile, is the sort of thing that would show regional and country by
country differences. For instance, there's been research finding that
people in England smile different from people in the United States. And
I think that those are the sort of contrasts that you would expect to
find in cross-cultural differences. Every culture is going to have Pan
Am smiles, happiness smiles, coy smiles, but the variation of that sort
is something which will vary as a result of how you're raised and the
people around you.</p>

<p>I want to deal with a few emotions in this class and next and the
first case study of an emotion I want to deal with is the emotion of
fear. And I want to deal with fear for different reasons. One reason is
it's a basic emotion, it's universal. All humans have it. Many
nonhumans, probably most nonhuman, species have it too. And it also
brings us back to the lecture on behaviorism where we talked about
classical conditioning and different theories of what people are afraid
of. It's a nonsocial emotion. What I mean by this is it's possible, of
course, to be afraid of a person, but unlike an emotion like gratitude,
it's not intrinsically social. You could be afraid of falling off a
cliff or something. It has a distinctive facial expression again.</p>

<p>This is a famous picture of Lee Harvey Oswald who was being
assassinated by Jack Ruby. And this is the detective's face standing
there, a mixture of fear and anger â€“ the face being drawn back in a
universal expression that every human everywhere would be able to
recognize.</p>

<p>So, the basic question to ask is "What are we afraid of?" And the
answer's a little bit interesting. We're afraid of spiders, snakes,
heights, storms, large animals, darkness, blood, strangers,
humiliation, deep water, and leaving home alone. We are afraid of other
things too but those are big things to be afraid of. I'm not even going
to ask. If there's somebody who--in this room, who's not afraid of any
of those things? You're a tougher person than I am. These are universal
fear elicitors. Why? What do they have in common? Why would you be
afraid of those things? And the answer is--And why would--why are there
so few people afraid of guns, cars, and electrical outlets?</p>

<p>The answer is not particularly surprising. These are things
that--something's ticking over there. [referring offstage] These are
things that are scary in our ancestral environment. More particularly,
these are things that through the course of human evolution have been
dangerous to us. And so, we are afraid of these things [pointing to a
slide containing spider, snakes, heights etc.] and not so afraid of
these things [pointing to guns, cars, electrical outlets, etc.];
similarly for nonhuman primates. So, chimpanzees are afraid of certain
things and they can often develop phobias for certain things, but the
phobias they develop, the fears they develop, are things like spiders
and snakes.</p>

<p>There was a nice study done in urban Chicago, in the inner city of
Chicago. And they asked children raised in the inner city, "What are
you most afraid of?" And you might think they would say, "I'm afraid of
being shot. I'm afraid of guns. I'm afraid of being killed by somebody
or being harmed by somebody. I'm afraid of being run over by a car."
The two biggest fears of children in urban Chicago are that [pointing
to the slide], snakes and spiders, even though many of these children
have probably never seen a snake outside of a zoo in their lives. These
are natural fears.</p>

<p>There is some research done by the psychologist Judy DeLoache at
University of Virginia where she's studying babies' fears of spiders
and snakes, babies obviously who, since their parents are normal, have
not yet seen spiders and snakes. There are various ethical reasons why
you can't show babies--you can't try to construct phobias in babies of
spiders and snakes but the research she's finding using more indirect
methods finds, as one would expect, these are what psychologists would
call "pre-potent stimuli"; that is, these are things that naturally
elicit fear and concern. And that's all I have to say about fear.</p>

<p>I want to turn for the rest of this lecture and for next lecture
next week to the social emotions. And the social emotions can be broken
down into two categories. [a student sneezes] Bless you, bless you.
Those emotions you feel towards your kin, towards your genetic
relatives, and those emotions that you feel towards the people you're
not related to but interact with. And I want to focus particularly on
emotions that generate kind or altruistic behavior.</p>

<p>"Altruism" is the biologists' term meaning kindness, generosity, and
evolutionary biologists have worked really hard to explain why animals
might evolve to be kind. A very old, very wrong view of evolution is
that evolution has shaped animals such that they're merely survival
machines. If so, then from an evolutionary standpoint any kindness
towards an animal--that an animal shows towards another animal--is a
mystery. If evolution wired us up simply to survive, then it's a puzzle
why animals would relate positively to other animals. But of course,
that's not true.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example showing it's not true. Imagine two genes,
two sorts of animals each containing their own gene. Gene "A" makes an
animal care for its offspring. Gene "B" makes an animal care only for
itself. Imagine what will happen in the next generation. Plainly, Gene
"A" will win out. It's a very simple case. An animal who has evolved a
brain that says, "Take care of your offspring" will do much better from
a natural selection point of view from an animal who has evolved a
brain that says, "Eat your offspring." The animal that eats its
offspring, those genes are a biological dead end. What matters then is
not survival, per se. What matters is reproduction. And so, that simple
fact is why we would expect animals to care for their children, because
children are the means through which genes replicate.</p>

<p>But it gets a little bit richer than that. And this is one of the
major revolutions in evolutionary biology over the last half century.
Forget about the animal a bit and take another perspective. Take a
perspective of the cold virus. People have been sneezing in the front
row. Now, you're coughing. Thank you. Why do you sneeze when you get a
cold? Here's not a-- [more coughing, laughter] Point made. Here
is--Here's not a bad answer. You sneeze because you've got all these
germs inside you and your body wants to get the germs out, so you
sneeze. It's not that it's totally wrong, but it's not bad.</p>

<p>The real answer is a little bit more interesting. Don't look at it
from the person's perspective. If you have a cold, try to get away from
your own selfish perspective, "I have a cold." Look at it from the
perspective of the cold virus. The cold virus has evolved just as much
as you evolved. And it's evolved due to survival and reproduction. What
the cold virus does is evolve different strategies to cause it to
reproduce. And what it does is--one way to reproduce is to occupy other
animals and manipulate their bodies so as to expel it. From this point
of view then, the reason why you sneeze when you have a cold is that
your cold--the cold virus is using your body as a tool to replicate
itself. From this person--this perspective, a person is just a germ's
way of making other germs. And there's tons of other examples of
this.</p>

<p>There's a parasite known as toxoplasmosis that lives in the bodies
of rats. But it gets passed on when the rats get eaten by cats. And
then it ends up in the cats' feces and then it ends up back in rats. If
you are a rat and you have toxoplasmosis, you are perfectly healthy
except for one thing. The toxoplasmosis rewires your brain and it makes
you less afraid of cats. Now, again, this is not some sort of bizarre
quirk of a humorous god. Rather, it's because this is a perfectly--this
is the adaptive strategy of the toxoplasmosis virus.</p>

<p>In fact, a real powerful virus would skip the respiratory system
altogether, even better than a cold virus. What it would do is it would
take over the brain and it will make people want to run around and have
sex with other people and kiss them on the mouth. And in fact, there is
some evidence that this happens. There's some evidence, for instance,
that one of the effects of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis
is it arouses the libido, makes people more sexually engaged, because
this is part of the strategy through which these viruses replicate
themselves. Imagine a virus, for instance, that captured an animal's
brain and then modified the animal's brain such that the animal would
run out and bite other animals so as to pass on the virus. And then, of
course, you would call that virus "rabies." Along these lines, the
evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins took the general step of
suggesting that animals are the vehicles through which genes exploit to
reproduce. From this perspective, an animal is just the person's--is
just the gene's way of creating another animal.</p>

<p>Well, as psychologists, what benefit does that--does this way of
analysis give us? It actually can help us explain altruism. So, which
genes are going to survive? Well, the genes that survive are going to
be the ones that make the most copies of themselves. Animals are
vehicles through which genes reproduce. An animal's merely the gene's
way of making another gene. Hence, selfish genes will lead to
altruistic animals because, to the extent that evolution operates at
the level of the genes, there's no hard and fast distinction between
your own body and someone else's body.</p>

<p>And here's an illustration by the biologist Haldane. So, Haldane was
once asked, "Would you lay down your life for your brother?" And he
responded, "No, but I would gladly give my life for three brothers or
five nephews or nine first cousins." Now, he's joking. You don't
actually do the math if you're normal. But what he's capturing is the
logic, the ultimate causation of our feelings towards our kin. Our
genes have wired us up--our brains up to love our children and love our
kin because, in this way, our genes manage to replicate themselves. And
in fact, you get his calculations by looking at genetic
relatedness.</p>

<p>The genetic relatedness, from an evolutionary standpoint, affects
how much you care for other people. From the standpoint of your genes,
you dying for the life of three brothers is an excellent compromise
because the genes replicate by fifty percent more. If you
imagined--;So, here is his calculations. If you imagined a choice
between this one gene that makes the animal choose to die and the other
gene that makes an animal choose for its brothers to die, the gene that
sacrifices the body it belongs to will make more copies in the future.
And there's an interesting irony to this. The selfish gene theory is
often seen as sort of a cold-blooded evolutionary analysis, but it
provides a scientific basis for real, genuine altruism, for really
arguing that, from the standpoint of the genes, there really is no hard
and fast difference between yourself and another person.</p>

<p>From this perspective, we can start to answer some interesting
questions at least about nonhumans. When a new male lion takes over a
pride what he does is kill all the remaining cubs and any lionesses
undergo spontaneous abortions. This all might seem very cruel but from
a genetic standpoint it makes sense. The other cubs are genetic
competition for him. They do not have his genes. Moreover, only once
they're out of the way can he reproduce and copulate with the females.
The females do their spontaneous abortions because that's a reliable
adaptive trick. These cubs are not going to survive once they are born
so the female's best strategy is to get rid of them and start anew.</p>

<p>From a psychological point then, animals have evolved to be nice to
their kin, particularly their children, and particularly in birds and
mammals. Birds and mammals invest in quality and not quantity, as
opposed to fish and reptiles. For birds and mammals, we don't have many
kids but--so we devote a huge amount of psychological energy to
protecting the ones that we have. Moreover, the kids we have are
vulnerable for long periods of time and require our resources. So,
there's various psychological mechanisms that this gives rise to. One
is how parents or how adults in general respond to children. Another
one is how children respond to parents. And I'll briefly talk about a
few of these phenomena.</p>

<p>[plays a sound of a baby crying] Small animals make distress calls.
They chirp, they mew, they bleat or they cry. The governing of a
distress call is actually an extremely delicate high-wire act for any
young organism from an evolutionary point of view. It has to on the one
hand be annoying enough to actually generate help, to get people to
help you, to feed you, to pick you up, to take you and put them next to
you. On the other hand, it can't be so annoying that the people around
you kill you [laughter] and so it's complicated. But, from your point
of view, you're wired up to respond to them. That sound is, at very
minimum, extremely annoying. And it's more--it's not annoying because
of its volume or pitch. It's annoying because your brains are wired up
so that that baby cry is going to drive you up the wall.</p>

<p>On the more positive side, babies are cute. I got this [picture]
from Google Images, typing in "cute baby," [laughter] getting rid of
the porn and [laughter] coming on to that. No, no, <i>Playboy</i>, but
anyway it was over that. [laughter] And do not be tempted to say,
"Isn't it wonderful that the way nature works is that babies are cute?
Otherwise we would have killed them." [laughter] That's not the right
story. If--Babies are not--Human babies are not, sort of,
metaphysically cute. If Martians came down they wouldn't say, "Oh, cute
baby." Rather, they're cute because of how our brains are wired up.
They're cute because there are certain cues that correspond to the way
our brains work.</p>

<p>And in fact, this is how it works for all mammals. So, babies have
these big, protruding foreheads, an upturned little nose, chubby cheeks
and big eyes. Those are the ingredients for cute. Stephen Jay Gould has
a wonderful essay where he discussed this, looking at the evolution of
Mickey Mouse from the Walt Disney character. Mickey Mouse starts off as
an ugly, little rodent. [laughter] Over time he gets cuter and cuter
and cuter as the artist converged on more and more baby-like
features.</p>

<p>Studies of adults show what's known as a baby-face bias. This is not
unique to the United States. The same studies have been done in Asia.
You find a baby face in an adult, Leonardo DiCaprio, to be particularly
naÃ¯ve, helpless, kind and warm. And in mock trials, people with baby
faces are more likely to be found innocent than people like Ben
Affleck, [laughter] who do not have baby faces. [laughter] Now, one
question which is going to come up for an entire lecture later on is
"who is sexier, the baby faced man or Testosterone Man?" here [pointing
to Ben Affleck]. [laughter] And I am going to ask actually for a vote
because I'm going to return to this. I do not--I only want the men to
vote, please. Who would go for--And forget the fact that he looks sort
of unhappy. Who would go for Ben Affleck here? Okay. [laughter] Who
would go for Leonardo? Okay. [laughter] Well, the women votes would
actually be more complicated. We will discuss when we get the lecture
on sex. Your choice will depend on where you are in the menstrual
cycle. [laughter]</p>

<p>Now, so far, we're talking about how babies respond to--We're
talking about our responses to babies. What about babies' responses to
us? Well, there's a very old theory known as the "Cupboard Theory"
proposed by the behaviorist B.F. Skinner which argues that babies'
attachment to their parents is because the parent provides food,
characteristically breast milk, but it could be food from a bottle or
whatever. And because of operant conditioning, the baby is driven
towards the adult. An alternative theory is that of Bowlby, which is
that they're drawn to their mother for comfort and social interaction
as well as fear of strangers.</p>

<p>To test this, the psychologist Harlow performed a series of
ingenious experiments with nonhuman primates distinguishing between
what he called "wire mothers" and "cloth mothers." And you'll see
illustrations of this to follow. Wire mothers are mothers that are
built that they give food. They have a little nipple attached and you
can drink from it and give food to the baby. And that's the baby's
source of food. Cloth mothers don't give any food but they give warmth
and comfort.</p>

<p>There was a while in the psychology department where one professor
was known to be extremely supportive to his students but didn't really
provide much warmth. And he was known as the cloth mother. And another
one was very productive and everything but provided no love. And she
was known as the wire mother. But anyway, I'll show you the movies.
[movie playing]</p>

<p>I have to warn you this third and final movie is an example of why
this research is not currently done, but it illustrates an important
scientific point. Oh. Now him-- [movie playing]</p>

<p>I think I'm-- [showing pictures of cute baby animals] They're just
more Google Images. [laughter] I think I'll--I want to begin next class
by wrapping up and explaining the Harlow studies in more detail and
what they tell us. And then we'll move towards altruism, towards non
kin. I'll see you next week.</p>
