<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> I'm delighted to introduce the first
guest lecturer for this Introduction to Psychology course, Dean Peter
Salovey. Peter is an old friend and colleague. Many of you--I think
everybody here knows of him through his role as Dean of Yale College.
I'll just, in this context of this introduction, mention two other
things about him. One is prior to being dean and in fact, still as a
dean, he's an active scientist and in particular, a social psychologist
actively involved in studying health psychology, the proper use of
psychological methods to frame health messages, and also is the founder
and developer of the idea of emotional intelligence, an idea he's done
a huge amount of research on. Secondly, Peter is or was an active and
extremely well-known teacher at Yale College. He taught at one point,
the largest course ever in Yale College – a course on Psychology in Law
which broke every record ever had here. And before that, during that,
and after that, he was a legendary Introduction to Psychology teacher.
And I think--and he had some reason for why he was so legendary with
his lecture today on the topic of love.</p>

<p>[applause]</p>

<p><b>Dean Peter Salovey:</b> Thanks very much. Okay. Thank you very
much, Professor Bloom. It really is a pleasure to come and lecture to
you today on Valentine's Day on the topic of love. My main area of
research is human emotion. And love is an emotion. It's not one that I
study personally, at least not in the lab, and--but it is fun to talk
about. And it is a topic that lends itself to many social psychological
phenomena. It's also great to be able to come in and guest lecture. One
of the things I very much miss since serving as dean is the opportunity
to teach Psychology 110. And although I love being dean, I do miss
teaching Introductory Psychology, the feeling of exposing people to
ideas that maybe you hadn't heard before.</p>

<p>Well, I suspect some of the ideas in this talk you'll have not heard
before and for a variety of reasons. A couple of the things you'll
notice is that some of the experiments I'll talk about today are not
the kinds of experiments that can be done anymore. They're not
considered ethically acceptable but they were done in the ‘50s and ‘60s
and early ‘70s when ethical standards were different and so we can
teach them. We just can't give you the same experiences that some of
the college students that we'll talk about today in these studies
had.</p>

<p>The other thing I will mention is that there is a certain
androcentric and heterosexual quality to much of the social
psychological research on romantic love. You'll see that in the
experiments. Usually, the participants are men and usually the targets
are women in these experiments. I'm not endorsing this as the only way
to study love. It just happens to be the way these experiments were
done and so I mention this caution right from the beginning. We'll have
to think about--One of the things you should think about is do you
think these experiments generalized to other kinds of dyadic
relationships. And that's a question that I think you can ask
throughout this lecture.</p>

<p>Okay. So let's get started. And to start things off I think what we
need to do is consider a definition. I'm going to define what love is
but then most of the experiments I'm going to talk about are really
focused more on attraction than love--who finds each other of romantic
interest that might then develop into a love relationship. But let's
start with a definition of love. And I'm going to pick a definition
from a former colleague, Robert Sternberg, who is now the dean at Tufts
University but was here on our faculty at Yale for nearly thirty years
or so. And he has a theory of love that argues that it's made up of
three components: intimacy, passion, and commitment, or what is
sometimes called decision commitment. And these are relatively
straightforward. He argued that you don't have love if you don't have
all three of these elements.</p>

<p>Intimacy is the feeling of closeness, of connectedness with someone,
of bonding. Operationally, you could think of intimacy as you share
secrets, you share information with this person that you don't share
with anybody else. Okay. That's really what intimacy is, the bond that
comes from sharing information that isn't shared with other--with many
other people. Second element is passion. Passion is what you think it
is. Passion is the--we would say the drive that leads to romance. You
can think of it as physical attraction or sex. And Sternberg argues
that this is a required component of a love relationship. It is not,
however, a required component of taking a shower in Calhoun College. [a
Yale dormitory] [laughter]</p>

<p>The third element of love in Sternberg's theory is what he calls
decision or commitment, the decision that one is in a love
relationship, the willingness to label it as such, and a commitment to
maintain that relationship at least for some period of time. Sternberg
would argue it's not love if you don't call it love and if you don't
have some desire to maintain the relationship. So if you have all three
of these, intimacy, passion and commitment, in Sternberg's theory you
have love. Now what's interesting about the theory is what do you have
if you only have one out of three or two out of three? What do you have
and how is it different if you have a different two out of three? These
are--What's interesting about this kind of theorizing is it give--it
gives rise to many different permutations that when you break them down
and start to look at them carefully can be quite interesting. So what
I've done is I've taken Sternberg's three elements of love, intimacy,
passion and commitment, and I've listed out the different kinds of
relationships one would have if you had zero, one, two or three out of
the three elements.</p>

<p>And I'm using names or types that Sternberg uses in his theory.
These are really from him. Some of these are pretty obvious. If you
don't have intimacy, if you don't have passion, if you don't have
commitment, you don't have love. Sternberg calls this non-love. That's
the technical term. And [laughs] essentially what he's saying is the
relationship you now have to the person sitting next to you, presuming
that you're sitting next to a random person that you didn't know from
your college, is probably non-love. If it's something else, we could
talk about it at the end of the lecture or perhaps when I get to it in
a moment.</p>

<p>Now let's start to add elements. Let's add intimacy. This is sharing
secrets, a feeling of closeness, connectedness, bonding. Let's say we
have that with someone but we don't have passion, that is, no sexual
arousal, and no commitment to maintain the relationship. This is
liking. Sternberg calls it liking. And liking is really what is
happening in most typical friendships, not your closest friendship but
friendships of a casual kind. You feel close, you share certain
information with that person that you don't share with other--many
other people, but you're not physically attracted and there's no
particular commitment to maintaining this for a long period of
time.</p>

<p>Now, what if you're not intimate, you're not committed, but you're
passionate; you feel that sexual arousal. This is what Sternberg would
call infatuation. And that term probably works for you too, infatuated
love, and this is love at first sight. "I don't know you, we've never
shared any secrets because I don't know you, I'm not committed to
defining this as anything, I'm not committed to the future. In fact,
I'm not thinking about the future. I'm thinking about right now but
boy, am I attracted." Right. That's infatuation and that's what
Sternberg means by infatuated love.</p>

<p>The third kind of one-element relationship is there's no intimacy,
right, no bonding, no closeness, no secrets, no physical attraction, no
sexual arousal, but by gosh, we are going to maintain this
relationship, we are committed to it for all time. Sternberg calls that
"empty love." Empty love is kind of interesting. It's often the final
stage of long-term relationships that have gone bad. "We don't share
information with each other anymore so there's no intimacy. We don't
feel physically attracted to each other anymore, there's no passion,
but we'd better stay together for the kids, right? Or we've got to stay
together for appearance's sake or we'd better stay together because
financially it would be a disaster if we don't" or all of the reasons
other than intimacy and passion that people might commit to each other.
That's what Sternberg calls empty love.</p>

<p>Now what's interesting is in societies where marriages are arranged
this is often the first stage of a love relationship. These two people
who have maybe never seen each other before, who have never shared
secrets so there's no intimacy, who have never--don't know if they're
physically attracted to each other or on their wedding day revealed to
each other and committed legally and sometimes religiously to each
other. Right? The commitment is there but at that moment nothing else
might be there. What's interesting of course is that such relationships
don't seem to have any greater chance of ending in divorce than people
who marry for love. But there's a big confound, there's a big problem
in studies of those kind of relationships. What might it be? Anybody.
What might be the problem in the statement I just made that these kind
of relationships are just as likely to survive as people who marry for
love? Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Dean Peter Salovey:</b> Yeah. So they may occur; they're more
likely to occur in societies that frown on divorce. They make it very
costly, socially costly, to divorce, so then they stay together for all
kinds of reasons, not always such good ones.</p>

<p>All right. Now who was it who sang the song "Two Out of Three Ain't
Bad"? Was that Meat Loaf? Who was it? It was Meat Loaf. All right.
Professor Bloom says it was Meat Loaf. It was Meat Loaf. You're all
saying, "there was a singer called Meat Loaf?" Meat Loaf sang the song
"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad." Let's see if two out of three ain't bad.
What if you have intimacy, "we share secrets, passion, we feel
physically attracted to each other but we're not making any commitments
here." Sternberg calls that "romantic love." This is physical
attraction with close bonding but no commitment, Romeo and Juliet when
they first met. This is often the way relationships start: "We like
each other, I'm physically attracted to each other, I--to you, I enjoy
spending time with you but I'm not making any long-term commitments. So
I'm not even willing to use the ‘L' word in describing what it is we
have." Right? Many of you might have been in relationships of this
sort. That's romance. That's romantic love.</p>

<p>Now, what if you have intimacy, "we share secrets with each other,
but there's no particular physical attraction but we are really
committed to this relationship." This is what Sternberg calls
"companionate love." This is your best friend. "We are committed to
sharing intimacy, to being friends forever," but physical attraction is
not part of the equation here. This is sort of the--maybe the Greek
ideal in relationships of some kind.</p>

<p>All right. What if we have passion, "I'm sexually attracted to you,"
but no intimacy. "I don't want to really know that much about you, I
don't want to really share anything of me with you, but I am committed
to maintaining this physical attraction to you" [laughter] Well, that's
what Sternberg calls "fatuous love." It's a whirlwind courtship. It's a
Hollywood romance. It might lead to a shotgun wedding. Maybe you find
yourself in Las Vegas and you get married for a day and a half and then
realize that this wasn't such a good idea. And maybe your name is
Britney and you're a singer. [laughter]</p>

<p>Well, anyway, you've got the idea. That's fatuous love. "We are
basically committed to each other for sex" but it's very hard to make
those relationships last a long time because we might not have anything
in common, we might not share anything with each other, we might not
trust each other, we are not particularly bonded to each other. On the
other hand, if you have all three, intimacy, passion, commitment, this
is "consummate love" according to Sternberg – complete love. This is
how he defines love.</p>

<p>Okay. So now you have a definition of love and you can now, as a
homework assignment, sit down tonight and make a list of every person
you know by the three elements of love and just start putting the check
marks in the boxes and tallying up your personal love box score. And we
don't want to collect those. We don't even want to see those but you
can have fun with that. Then you can ask the other people to do it too
and you can compare with each other. [laughter] And if you all survive
this exercise you'll be better for it. [laughter] What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger. That's the idea behind that exercise.</p>

<p>All right. Now the social psychology of love really has been a
social psychology of attraction. What makes people find each other
attractive? What makes them want to be intimate? What makes them
physically desirable to each other? What might lead to a commitment, a
decision to make a commitment to make the relationship last? This is
just so nice. I'm giving this lecture on love and the two of you are
holding hands here in the front row. It's really-- [laughter] And--
[applause] All three elements present, intimacy, passion, and--
[laughter] Yeah. Okay. [laughter] Good. Just checking. [laughter]
Okay.</p>

<p>So what's interesting about the social psychology of attraction is
it has focused on seven variables. And I've divided these into two
groups, the big three and the more interesting four. And I call them
the big--The big three are three variables that the effects are so
powerful that they almost don't need to be discussed in much detail.
The more interesting four are the ones I'm going to focus on in this
lecture because they're a bit more subtle and they may be things that
you've never heard of before. But let's quickly talk about the big
three.</p>

<p>The way to understand the big three is with the phrase "all other
things being equal." All other things being equal, people who find
themselves in close spatial proximity to each other, like sharing an
armrest in a lecture, will be more likely to be attracted to each other
and form a romantic relationship. Okay, all other things being equal.
Now this has been tested in lots of interesting ways. Studies have been
done in the city of New York where you can--if you live in Manhattan
you can actually get a very nice metric of how far apart people live
from each other in city blocks. Right? You have a nice grid pattern and
you can use a city block metric to add up the number of blocks between
people's doors. And people who live more closely together are more
likely to end up in romantic relationships with each other. It seems
kind of obvious. Right? This even works on college campuses. We can
measure in feet the distance between the door to your room and the door
to every other room of a student on campus and there will be a
correlation between the likelihood of--it's a negative correlation--the
likelihood of getting into a romantic relationship with a person and
the number of feet between your door and that person's door. The fewer
feet, the more likely a romantic relationship, all other things being
equal.</p>

<p>Now, all other things being equal is a big qualifier. Right? But if
we could statistically control for every other variable, all I'd need
to do is measure the distance from your door to everybody else's door
on campus and I could chart out who's going to fall in love with whom
on the Yale campus. Now, this idea in a way is--I don't know. Maybe
it's a little counterintuitive. There is a kind of cultural myth around
the stranger, the person you don't know, who you will--who you fall in
love with. And that is not likely to be the case if it's the person who
is nearby. Right? And you'll see as we go through the other big--the
other two "big three" that there is a kind of repetition of this theme.
It isn't the stranger you fall in love with.</p>

<p>All right. Let's continue down. Similarity. You've probably heard
the phrase "Birds of a feather flock together" and that's true when it
comes to romance. On any dimension that psychologists have measured in
these kinds of studies, when people are more similar they are more
likely to find each other attractive. This could be obvious things like
height or age but it also could be things like attitudes toward capital
punishment, preference for the Red Sox over the Yankees. Right? All of
these are dimensions of similarity. All things being equal, the more
similar the more likely you'll find each other attractive. So,
opposites don't really attract. Birds of a feather may flock together
but opposites don't really attract each other.</p>

<p>Now, usually at this point somebody in the lecture hall raises their
hand and says, "Well, my boyfriend or my girlfriend and I are complete
opposites and how do you account for that, Professor Salovey?" And I
usually look at them and I say, "Good luck." [laughter]</p>

<p>And of course all things might not be equal. There may be other
variables at play but, all things being equal, similarity does not
breed contempt. Similarity breeds attraction. Okay? Isn't it
interesting? We have all of these common sayings that contradict each
other and then empirically, some of them turn out to have more evidence
supporting them than others. So "opposites attract?" Not much evidence.
"Similarity breeds contempt?" Not much evidence. "Birds of a feather
flock together?" Yeah, there's some evidence for that anyway.</p>

<p>Finally, familiarity. Familiarity--We tend to fall in love with
people in our environment with whom we are already familiar. The idea
that some enchanted evening we will see a stranger--Where are The New
Blue [a Yale a cappella group that sings for couples on Valentine's
Day] when you need them? [laughter] "Some enchanted evening you will
see a stranger across a crowded room." Right? What musical is that
from? "South Pacific." Very good. You will see a stranger across a
crowded room. That's kind of a cultural myth. Of course it happens, but
much more common is somebody you already know, somebody you have seen
repetitively you suddenly find attraction--attractive and a
relationship forms. Okay?</p>

<p>So the big three: People who are similar to you, people who are
already familiar to you, people who are nearby in space. These are the
people, all things being equal, that you will find attractive. Okay? So
those are the big three. Those are big main effects. Those are big,
easy to observe in various ways in the lab. By the way, the familiarity
idea doesn't just work for people. I can show you words in a language
that you don't speak and I can flash those words to you very quickly
and I can later repeat some of those words and mix in some new ones
that you've never seen before and I can say, "I don't know--I know you
don't know what any of these words mean. I know you can't read these
characters but just, if you had to tell me, which ones do you like and
which ones don't you like or how much do you like each one?" The ones
you will like are the ones you saw earlier, the ones that you already
have familiarity. Even if you don't remember having seen them, even if
that familiarity was generated with such quick exposures that you don't
remember even having seen anything, you will get that familiarity
effect. Okay? Good.</p>

<p>The more interesting four. These are more interesting because
they're a little bit complicated, a little bit subtle. Let's start with
actually the one that is my favorite. This is "competence." Think about
other people in your environment. Think about people who are competent.
Generally--And think about people who are incompetent. Generally, we
are more attracted to people who seem competent to us. Now, that isn't
very interesting. And it turns out that's not really the effect. Yes,
we're more attracted to people who are competent than people who we
think are incompetent but people who are super competent, people who
seem competent on all dimensions, they're kind of threatening to us.
They don't make us feel so good about ourselves. Right? They make us
feel a bit diminished by comparison. So, what we really like--The kind
of person we're really attracted to is the competent individual who
occasionally blunders. And this is called the Pratfall Effect, that our
liking for the competent person grows when they make a mistake, when
they do something embarrassing, when they have a failure experience.
Okay?</p>

<p>You can see this with public figures. Public figures who are viewed
as competent but who pratfall, who make a mistake, sometimes they are
even more popular after the mistake. Okay? I think of Bill Clinton when
he was President. His popularity at the end of his term, despite what
everyone would agree, whether you like Bill Clinton or not, was a big
mistake with Monica Lewinsky, his popularity didn't suffer very much. A
lot of people in the media would describe him, "Well, he's just--It
just shows he's human." He makes mistakes like the rest of us, even
though that was a pretty big mistake. Right? And you could see this
even with smaller pratfalls. Sometimes public figures are liked even
more after their pratfall.</p>

<p>Now, the classic experiment, the classic pratfall experiment, is
just a beautiful one to describe. It's a work of art. So, let me tell
you a little bit about it. You're in this experiment. You're brought to
the lab and you're listening to a tape recording of interviews with
people who are described as possible representatives from your college
to appear on a quiz show. The quiz show is called "College Bowl," which
I don't think is on anymore but was on when I was in college. And
you're listening to interviews with possible contestants from Yale who
are going to be on "College Bowl." You have to decide how much--What
you're told is you have to decide who should be chosen to be on
"College Bowl." And you listen to these interviews. Now what's
interesting is there's two types of people, the nearly perfect person
and the mediocre person. The nearly perfect person answered 92% of the
questions correctly, admitted modestly to being a member of the campus
honor society, was the editor of the yearbook, and ran varsity track.
That's the nearly perfect person. The mediocre person answers only 30%
of the questions correctly, admits that he has only average grades, he
worked on the yearbook as a proofreader, and he tried out for the track
team but didn't make it. So, you see, they're keeping a lot of the
elements consistent but in one case he's kind of an average performer
and in the other case nearly perfect.</p>

<p>Now, which of these two people do you find more attractive in
listening to the tape? So, when they ask you questions about which
person should be on the quiz show, people say the more competent
person. But they also ask questions like, "How attractive do you find
this person?" Now, you're only listening to an audiotape. How
attractive do you find this person? And the results are pretty obvious.
The competent person is rated as much more attractive, considerably
more attractive, than the mediocre person. Okay? If this were the end
of the story though, it would be a kind of boring story and it's not
the end of the story.</p>

<p>Now, what happens is half of the participants in the experiment who
have listened to each of these tapes--You only get to listen to one
tape. Half of them are assigned to the blunder condition. And what
happens in the blunder condition is the tape continues and what you
hear is the clattering of dishes, a person saying--the person saying,
"Oh, my goodness. I've spilled coffee all over my new suit." Okay?
That's the blunder. That's the pratfall. Now you're asked, "Who do you
find more attractive?" And look what happens. Your rating of the
attractiveness of the competent person grows even higher. The competent
person who blunders, this is the person that I love. Unfortunately, the
mediocre person who blunders, you now think is even more mediocre.
[laughter] Right? This is the sad irony in these experiments. The
effect works both ways so the mediocre become even more lowered in your
esteem, in your regard.</p>

<p>Now, I'll tell you a little personal story about my coming to Yale
that relates to this experiment. This is one of the most famous
experiments in the history of social psychology. I wouldn't quite put
it up there. You'll hear maybe later about, or maybe you've already
about Milgram and maybe Asch conformity and maybe Robber's Cave. Those
are even better known than this, but this is right up there. This is a
top five experiment. What--So--And it was done by Elliot Aronson who
has retired now, but for many years taught at the University of
California at Santa Cruz. The name is not one that you need to
know.</p>

<p>In any case, I came to Yale in 1981 as a graduate student and I was
looking for an adviser and I was kind of interviewing with a faculty
member at Yale at the time named Judy Rodin. Some of you may know that
name because she went on later to become the President of the
University of Pennsylvania and now is the President of the Rockefeller
Foundation. But I was interviewing with her and set up a meeting. And
what I was trying to persuade her in this meeting was to take me on as
one of her students, to let--to be my adviser. And it's about my third
or fourth week of graduate school and I'm pretty nervous about this.
And she could be intimidating to a first-year graduate student.</p>

<p>And I remember I was holding this mug of coffee and I was pleading
with her, trying to convince her to take me on as her student, and I
was saying, "Judy, I'll get a lot done. I'll work really hard. I can
analyze data. I can write." And I'm talking about myself and I'm
swinging--I'm using my hands as I talk. I'm swinging this cup of coffee
around. And fairly soon into the conversation I demonstrated some
principle that you've probably learned in your physics class having to
do with an object at rest remaining at rest unless acted upon by a
force. Well, the object at rest was the coffee in the cup and when I
pulled the coffee cup out from under the coffee it landed right on her
desk and began--I watched in slow motion as this wave of coffee just
moved from my side of the desk to her side of the desk.</p>

<p>She jumped up and jumped back and started moving papers around and
really was giving me this look like "Why don't you just leave?" So, I
was trying to save the moment as best as I could, and I looked at her
and I said, "Judy, do you remember that old experiment that Elliot
Aronson did [laughter] on attractiveness?" [laughter] She looked at me
kind of out of the corner of her eye and I said, "Well, that was my
blunder. [laughter] Now you're going to like me even more." [laughter]
And she just shook her head and she said, "Peter, Peter, Peter. You
know that effect only works if I think you're competent first."
[laughter] Anyway, that was my introduction to Yale, graduate school at
Yale. [laughter]</p>

<p>All right. So blundering. Only blunder if you're competent first and
it will make you more attractive. That is the Pratfall Effect. Let's
move on and I'm going to move a little bit quickly through all this
because I want to leave time for a few questions at the end of the
lecture.</p>

<p>Let's talk about physical attractiveness as number two of the more
interesting four. Now physical attractiveness is one that really
bothers us. We don't like to believe that physical attractiveness
accounts for much in life. It seems unfair. Except at the margins,
there isn't much we can do about physical attractiveness. And when
we're not pictured in <i>The Rumpus</i> [a satirical Yale newspaper
that publishes a list of the best looking people on campus] it can
really hurt. [laughter] So, we all like to believe that physical
attractiveness matters. And the interesting thing is if you do surveys
of college students and you say to them, "Rate how important different
characteristics are in relationships that you might be involved in,"
they will say that warmth is important, sensitivity is important,
intelligence is important, compassion is important, a sense of humor is
important, and they'll say that looks aren't important. But if you
measure all of those things--Let's do it in a different order. If you
send everybody out on a blind date and then you look at, after the
blind date, how many of those people who are matched up blindly
actually go on a second date, actually get together again, what
predicts who gets together again? Was it the rating of warmth? No.
Sensitivity? No. Intelligence? No. Compassion? No. Sense of humor? No.
What was it? Looks. So we believe that looks don't matter and
unfortunately they do.</p>

<p>Now, the good news in all of this is the studies that looked at
physical attractiveness in this way were just looking at what predicts
a second date after a first date. Obviously, what predicts a long-term
relationship are probably things less superficial than looks, or at
least other things in addition to looks. But it is a great predictor of
a second date. And college students year after year say, "But it's not
important." And it's one of those classic disassociations between what
we think is unimportant and what empirically turns out to be more
important.</p>

<p>Alright well, there are very interesting studies that have been done
with physical attractiveness. At the University of Minnesota, a
computer algorithm paired people up. It couldn't have been a very
complicated algorithm because it basically paired people up randomly on
the campus. But the computer--but a lot of data about all the students
on campus were--was collected--were collected and people were then
randomly paired up and sent to the dance. And then they were tracked
over time. And just as in the thought experiment I just gave you, the
University of Minnesota students acted in the same way. If the
computer--If they rated their partner as attractive, the randomly
assigned partner, they were more likely to continue the
relationship.</p>

<p>Now it's interesting to ask, "why?" And we have to start to look at
other experiments to try to get at what is it about physical
attractiveness that makes people want to pursue the relationship? And
once again Elliot Aronson, the person who did the blunder experiment,
the "Pratfall" experiment, he did some nice work on attractiveness as
well. And in one experiment, which many people know as the "Frizzy Wig"
experiment, he did the following. He invited a confederate, a graduate
student who was working with him in his lab--Psychologists--Social
psychologists always call people who are in the employ of the
experimenter "confederates." It doesn't mean that they grew up south of
the Mason-Dixon Line or wave a certain kind of flag or--but the older
term for it was "stooge." They would say, "We hired a stooge to act in
the following role in the experiment." But I think a certain generation
of college students thought stooges were only named Moe, Larry, and
Curly and so they started to use the phrase "confederate." Now, they'll
usually just say, "We hired an actor."</p>

<p>But anyway, the confederate that they hired was a woman who was
naturally attractive in most people's view but they made her look
either more attractive or less attractive by giving her kind of frumpy
clothes, bad make-up, and a frizzy wig. And it was the frizzy wig that
everybody remembers from this experiment. And what she does in the
experiment is she poses as a graduate student in clinical psychology
who is interviewing male participants – only men in this experiment.
And at the end of the interview she gives them her own personal
clinical evaluation of their personality. Okay? So, that's all it is.
They have this interview with this woman. She's either made to look
very good or she's made to look kind of ugly with this frizzy wig and
they talk to her. She gives them an evaluation of their personality.
Half of the subjects receive a favorable personality assessment. Half
of them receive a kind of unfavorable evaluation.</p>

<p>How do they respond? Well, when she was made to look attractive they
were delighted when she gave them positive feedback about themselves.
When she was made to--When she gave--When she was made to look
attractive but gave them unfavorable information about themselves, they
were really upset about it. When she was made to look unattractive they
didn't really care what kind of information she gave. It didn't really
matter whether it was positive or not. It didn't really make any
difference. It was interesting. In the condition where she was made to
look attractive but gave you bad feedback about yourself, often the
subjects in that condition would look for an opportunity to interact
with her in the future, obviously to try to prove that her evaluation
was wrong. It mattered that much to them.</p>

<p>So there's kind of this idea that attractive people, their feedback
to us has more impact. I'm not saying this is fair, I'm not saying it's
rational, I'm not endorsing it, but empirically-- [coughs] excuse
me--empirically we can see it, that somehow the attractive--the
feedback from the attractive person matters more to us.</p>

<p>Okay. Number three of the more interesting four. Gain, loss. This is
really a general idea in psychology that we are in a way wired up to be
more sensitive to change than to steady states. And you could imagine
why that might be true. Change often signals danger or opportunity and
if we are especially tuned-in to change, it helps us survive and it
helps us pass along our genes. Okay? So we're more sensitive to
change.</p>

<p>How does that play out in love? Well, in love we are--what is very
powerful to us is not just that someone always is positive toward us,
"I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love --" Right? It
wears out its welcome. What's more powerful is the person who was not
that positive to us but over time becomes more positive. The first
derivative of their regard for us is positive. Okay? Aronson calls this
the "Gain Effect." We are really attracted to people whose regard for
us is gaining momentum over time. Okay? And even if over a period of
time the average amount of their regard is lower because they started
lower and then got higher than someone who was always high, it's the
ones who were first lower who then went up that capture our attention.
The first derivative is more important than just the position of their
regard for us, getting better and better.</p>

<p>Now, what's interesting is there is also a loss effect. People who
really hurt us are not the people who have always been negative. The
person who every time they sees you hates you, says they hate you and
accompanies it with an obscene gesture--after a while this person can't
hurt you. Right? There's a country song that Ricky Skaggs sings that
has the phrase in it "Nothing can hurt you like the person you love."
That's what hurts, the person who always was positive who now--whose
regard starts to fade. Oh. You can only hurt the one you love. Right?
You can only hurt the one you love because you are expecting positive
feedback from the one you love. And when that turns negative, it's a
blow. It's a blow to the solar plexus. Right? So you can only hurt the
one you can love but the one who always loves you sometimes has trouble
showing you that they love you. The one who didn't really love you that
much but then starts to show you that they love you, that person is a
powerful influence on your behavior.</p>

<p>Okay. The last--Oops. Come back. The last set of studies--Have you
talked about Schacter, Singer's "Emotions"? Okay. So let me describe to
you this phenomenon. This is a phenomenon about the misattribution for
the causes of arousal. You feel physiologically aroused but you're not
completely sure why, and you have to make up an explanation for it. I
think what I want to do--And sometimes that explanation is accurate,
but the ones that are interesting here are the ones where you
misattribute the cause of the arousal--you make a mistake and think
it's love when it might be due to something else.</p>

<p>So, let's do a thought experiment. I'm a Yale college student, for
the purposes of this thought experiment and I live in Pierson because I
need to walk a great distance to Chapel Street, to the Starbuck's on
Chapel Street. And I have a friend who I don't know that well, somebody
who was sitting next to me in class a few weeks in a row. And I said,
"Would you like to go see The New Blue in concert and then get coffee
after it Friday night?" And she says to me, "Sure. I would do that."
And so The New Blue concert takes place in the Pierson-Davenport
Theater in the basement there – what used to be a squash court is now a
little theater – and we enjoy ourselves at the concert and then I say,
"Let's go to Starbuck's and get a coffee."</p>

<p>And so, we walk that distance from Pierson College down to the York
Street Gate, over to Chapel Street, make the left on Chapel Street,
another block down to High, walk into the Starbuck's. And she says to
me, "You know, I'd better have a decaf because it's kind of late and I
want to be able to sleep." And I say, "That's fine. Whatever you want."
She says, "Yeah. So I'll have a decaf double espresso mocha skinny with
a--" What? What other dimensions are there? [laughter] Right? "A double
espresso mocha skinny frothed." [laughter] And I say, "Okay. Fine. I'll
have a coffee." [laughter] And I go up there and I order the drinks.
"I'll have a small coffee please and a double espresso mocha skinny
frothed" except the barista makes a mistake. Did the word "barista"
exist before Starbuck's? [laughter] I don't think so.</p>

<p>The barista makes a mistake. The barista uses caffeinated coffee in
the drink instead of decaf, doesn't tell anybody, doesn't tell me. I
don't see it. I just come back with my black coffee and my double
espresso mocha latte skinny frothed, except it isn't espresso. It's got
two shots of caffeinated espresso. I'm sorry. It isn't decaffeinated.
It's got two shots of caffeinated espresso in it. And I put it down on
the table and we're having this nice conversation and we're drinking
our beverages and it's about 12:30/1:00 now and Starbuck's is closing
and it's time to walk back to Pierson. And we're walking back to
Pierson and we leave the Starbuck's, we make a left on Chapel Street,
we're walking up to York, I'm getting a little sleepy, but my friend
looks at me and says, "Huh. I feel a little funny." What's actually
happening? Her heart is beating a little faster, [sound of heartbeat]
her palms are beginning to sweat, her breath is coming a little shorter
than it otherwise would. "I don't know. Is it warm in here?" And she
said, "I don't think I've felt this way in a very long time. [laughter]
"Gee. It couldn't be the coffee. I ordered decaf. What could this be?
What.." And she turns and she looks at me [laughter] and she says,
"What a day this has been. What a rare mood I'm in. Why, it's almost
like being in love." [laughter]</p>

<p>And it is almost like being in love except what it really is is two
shots of caffeinated espresso [laughter] causing a rapid heart rate, an
increase in respiration, sweaty palms, but I don't realize--she doesn't
realize that's what it is. She turns to the most salient--and this is
the way social psychologists would say it--turns to the most salient
object in her immediate social environment--that would be me--and
[laughter] says she's in love.</p>

<p>That's the idea of misattribution--aroused due to something else,
"don't know what that is." It's best if you don't know what that is or
even if you do mistakenly attribute it, misattribute it, to physical
attraction, romance, intimacy, passion and commitment, it's love.</p>

<p>All right. Now, I don't necessarily recommend that you do this
thought experiment in vivo this weekend, although if you're lonely you
might want to try it but [laughter] we can go--we can take this idea
right--We can actually do research on this. We could take it into the
lab. But before I tell you about lab experiments let me tell you about
the most famous field experiment on this idea.</p>

<p>We call this the "Rickety Bridge" experiment. And there is a bridge
at the University of British Columbia that crosses a river that runs
through campus and the rickety--There's actually two bridges. The
rickety bridge is one that's kind of a rope bridge. It's hundreds of
feet above the river. It sways in the breeze. It's only about three
feet wide. You kind of hold on to it carefully and you cross the river.
It's a pretty scary way to cross that river. Has anybody been--seen
this bridge? It's still there. Yes. You know this bridge. Okay. There's
another way to cross the river. It's on a low bridge near the water,
solid wood planks, nice and wide, hand railings made out of solid wood,
and you can cross the bridge that way.</p>

<p>So, what two investigators at the University of British Columbia did
is they simply positioned, once again, an attractive actor or
confederate on one side of the bridge. She was a woman and she met men
crossing the bridge. And she would intercept them as they came across
the rickety bridge, or the low bridge, and she would ask them a few
questions and conclude with, "Can you write me a story? You would help
me out with my experiment if you'd just write a little story right
now." Then she would collect their story and she would say, "If you
have any questions about this experiment, here is my phone number."
Actually, this happens when you're in experiments. You get the phone
number of the experimenter.</p>

<p>What happens? Well, the men, male students, who cross the rickety
bridge, they wrote these sexy stories with interesting content, with
kind of little bit ribald themes. And the people on the solid bridge,
they just wrote pretty boring stories. The people who crossed the
rickety bridge were more likely to call her up later and say, "Yeah.
I'd like to talk about that experiment I was in. Could we meet at the
Starbuck's? [laughter] You drink decaf, don't you?" Right? And the
people on the low bridge were much less likely to call her up.
Okay?</p>

<p>What was going on? Well, this was interpreted as misattributed
arousal. On the rickety bridge you're swaying in the breeze hundreds of
feet above the water, the bridge seems unstable. Maybe you'll make it.
Maybe you won't. Your heart is beating, your palms are sweating, you're
breathing harder. You meet this person and she seems more attractive
because you're feeling all these things. And you attribute it to the
attraction.</p>

<p>Now, there's a reason why this study is bad science. There's a major
flaw in this study. The clue to the flaw is that you can't even call
this study an experiment. What's the flaw? Anybody. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> The people who would take the rickety bridge might
be more likely to be more [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Dean Peter Salovey:</b> People who take the rickety bridge might
be the kind of people who are more looking for adventure than the
people who take the solid bridge. Right. Another way of saying it is
there isn't random assignment of the subjects to the two conditions in
the study. That's no random assignment; it's not an experiment. You--By
not randomly assigning people to these two conditions, you may be
capturing just individual differences in the kind of person who, when
there's a perfectly stable, safe, low bridge, says, "Huh uh. I won't
want to go on that bridge. I want to go on the bridge where I have to
risk my life to get to class." [laughter] And then should it surprise
us that that's the kind of person who would call a perfect stranger on
the telephone and write a sexy story and give it to them? [laughter]
Right? We're not so surprised. So what we have to do, of course, is
take it in to the lab and do this in a more systematic way with random
assignment. And this is how I'll want to finish up today. We have until
2:45, 3:45? Okay. Great. I'll take about five more minutes to finish up
and that'll give us some time for questions.</p>

<p>So how do you do this in the lab? Well, you can bring people in to
the lab and I can present you with a confederate who--Let's say you are
all in condition one, everybody on this side of the room, and I can say
to all of you, "Please wait here. We'll begin the experiment in a
moment. While you're waiting please fill out this form." And the form
includes how attractive--how attracted you are to the experimenter, to
me. I can do the same thing over here. I can give you the form and ask
you to rate how attractive you think I am and I can give you the same
instruction with a crucial difference: "Please wait here. We will begin
the painful shock experiment in a moment. Please fill out these forms
while you wait."</p>

<p>What happens? The people who got the painful shock instruction are
more likely to find the confederate attractive. [laughter] Why? While
they're sitting there thinking about painful shock it's making their
heart beat faster, [sound of heartbeat] it's making their palms sweat,
it's making them breathe harder maybe. And even though it's fairly
obvious what's doing that, they still misattribute that arousal to "I
must be falling in love," even with that obvious a--even with that
obvious an instruction.</p>

<p>You can do this in other ways. You can bring--Here is one of my
favorite ones. You bring people in the lab. We'll make them the control
group this time. We bring you in the--to the lab and we say to this
group of people, "Please wait here. We'll begin the experiment in a
moment. You can fill out these forms in the meantime." The forms ask
how attracted you are to the experimenter. You're now in the
experimental group and I say, "Please wait here. We'll begin the
experiment in a moment. I'm going to ask you to fill out some forms but
first, to get ready for this experiment, I'd like you to get on this
treadmill and run for ten minutes." So you've run on the treadmill.
You've just sat around. The people who've run on the treadmill, even
when that arousal is fairly obvious, you've got--you--doing a little
bit of aerobic exercise, you still find the experimenter more
attractive. Okay? This is why the fourth floor of Payne Whitney Gym is
such a dangerous place [laughter] and I urge you as your dean to be
very careful there. [laughter] Okay? It's that combination of aerobic
exercise and spandex [laughter] that leads to trouble.</p>

<p>All right. Now, here's the final experiment and I apologize for
this. It is a bit sexist in 2007 context, but let me explain. And we
could never do this--and one could never do this experiment today but
let me go through it with you and you'll apologize for its--some of its
qualities. In this experiment male subjects were brought in to the lab
and they were asked to look at centerfolds from <i>Playboy</i>
magazine. So, these are essentially photographs of naked women. And
they are wearing headphones that amplify their heartbeat and they are
asked among other things how attracted are they to the centerfold
photograph that they're looking at. So, maybe--I don't remember how
many they look at. Maybe it's about 10.</p>

<p>So, these slides are coming up. They've got the headphones on. The
headphones are amplifying their heartbeat and the slides are moving one
after another for a few seconds each slide and they're listening to
their heartbeat. [sound of heartbeat] Slide one. Slide two. Slide
three. Slide four. Slide five. Slide six. And then they're asked which
one did you find most attractive, which one are you most attracted to?
"Oh, slide five, absolutely. She's the woman I want to marry."
[laughter] Right? And what has happened is they're using this bodily
cue of their heartbeat to infer that that's who they find more
attractive.</p>

<p>Now, here is the twist. They're not actually listening to their
heartbeat. They're listening to a tape recording of a heartbeat. And
the experimenter is back there with the speed knob [laughter] and at
random intervals he just speeds up the tape of their heart [laughter]
and then slows it down. And it doesn't matter which slide he speeds up
the tape of the heartbeat on, that's the one the subject is more likely
to think is the person of their dreams, the person they're attracted
to. So even you can misattribute real arousal. You can even
misattribute phony arousal, arousal that isn't even coming from your
body. It's just coming--It's just being played to you randomly. You can
even misattribute that.</p>

<p>Okay. I think these experiments are cute and I think there's an
interesting phenomenon there. And it says something, in a way, about
how easily we can be misled as to what things in our environment, even
things coming from our own body, mean. But there's also some very
serious implications of this kind of work. One of them has to do with
domestic violence. So think about domestic violence situations and why
people stay in them. Why do people stay in relationships that are
violent? Now the number one reason, and we have to acknowledge it up
front, is usually economically there's no alternative or people believe
there's no alternative. "I can't leave because if I leave I'd be
homeless. If I leave I will starve, if my--if I leave my kids will
starve or there'll be danger to my kids." And that keeps people trapped
in abusive relationships but--And that's number one, but what else
might be going on?</p>

<p>Sometimes people don't realize that the relationship they're in is
abusive--it's psychologically or emotionally abusive. They get into
these fights and screaming matches and name-calling and such even if
it's not physical violence. And they feel a certain arousal when that
happens and they misattribute it. "Well, he wouldn't be yelling and
screaming at me if he didn't love me." Right? They misattribute that,
what might be anger, what might even be aggression and violence, to an
expression of love.</p>

<p>I have a friend who's a social psychologist who told me a story once
that really made me very nervous, although she's fine. She said, "When
I was dating my husband"--this is thirty years ago--"we were having a
tough time. We were in many, many arguments--We got into many, many
arguments and one time something happened where he came up to my car in
a parking lot and he was yelling at me through the window. And I rolled
up the window and before you know it he had punched out the window."
And yelling at her and punched out the window. He didn't touch her. And
he--she said to me, "That's when I knew he really loved me." And I
thought that's scary and I--and, all joking aside, that's scary but
that's misattributed arousal. "I'm feeling--when he did that I felt
something and I assumed it was love. What she was misattributing as
love--Well, she was misattributing his aggressive response as love. She
was misattributing her own fear as mutual attraction, as "And I must
love him." So, although we joke about these kinds of experiments, and
they are fun to talk about because they are unusual and cute, there is
also some serious implications of this kind of work that one might
think about. And you might think about other possible implications as
well. Okay. Let me stop there and see what kinds of questions we might
have.</p>

<p>[applause]</p>

<p><b>Dean Peter Salovey:</b> Thank you. Thanks very much. That's very
kind of you. Because we are on tape I'll repeat any questions that come
in. Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Dean Peter Salovey:</b> Right. So the question is in experiments
like the painful shock experiment if you are told in advance, like you
all are, through a consent form or by the experimenter, "This is an
experiment involving painful shock," will you still rate the
experimenter as more attractive or will you not be able to misattribute
the arousal? It is true. The more salient we make the source of the
arousal, the less likely you can get the effect. If in my thought
experiment I say to my friend, "Well, I know why you're feeling that
way. The reason why you're feeling that way is ‘cause the barista made
a mistake and gave you caffeinated espresso when you asked for decaf or
maybe you just love me." Right. The person is not likely to say, "Oh, I
bet it's love." They're more likely to think oh, caffeine, yeah. That's
the parsimonious explanation here." So it is true. The more salient you
make the cause of the arousal, the less likely you'll get the effect
but you can see even in experiments where the cause of the arousal is
somewhat obvious, at least to us, you can still get a misattribution
effect. Other questions. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Dean Peter Salovey:</b> Yeah. So the question is are any of these
factors, particularly the big three, proximity, familiarity, and
similarity--Do they affect the maintenance of relationships or just the
initial attraction? It's interesting. My guess is they affect both
initial and maintenance over time but the literature mostly focuses on
initial attraction, much richer data on that initial attraction and
those initial stages of the relationship in part because it's a little
hard to follow couples over time. Imagine the sort of Heisenberg-esque
problems we would get carefully following romantic couples over time
and interfering with them to ask questions and make observations. It
would be hard to let this couple naturally--this relationship naturally
unfold. So, we really get--So, really the focus of many of these
experiments is on initial attraction. That's why I always say my
lecture is on love, the definition of terms is about love, but the
experiments really are much more about attraction than about love.
Another question. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Can someone feel consummate love for more than one
person?</p>

<p><b>Dean Peter Salovey:</b> Oh. Can someone feel consummate love for
more than one person? That's a very good question. It's actually a
question that's debated in the literature. I didn't get into it at all
in this experiment--in this lecture--but there's an interesting debate
going on about love and many other emotions between people who take a
kind of evolutionary perspective on these states versus people who take
what might be called a more socially constructed perspective. And these
aren't necessarily so incompatible but the evolutionary perspective I
think would argue that you can feel that kind of love for more than one
person or at least it would facilitate the passing on of your genetic
material to a larger array of the next generation. So I think the
evolutionary explanation is not a problem but we have constructed a
world where in most societies, except for very unusual polygamist
societies, the belief is that you can't love more than one. Right. And
so you've got this tension between what might be evolutionarily wired
impulses and the kind of social constraints that say this isn't good,
this isn't appropriate, this is taboo. And my guess is the result is
yes, you could but you're not going to feel un-conflicted about it and
it's because these two are conflicting each other at the same time. How
about one more question and then we'll let you go? I'm sorry. I saw him
first.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Wouldn't natural selection favor the people who
learn all these things and then practically try to apply them?</p>

<p><b>Dean Peter Salovey:</b> So he's making the evolutionary argument.
Wouldn't natural selection favor the people who take introductory
psychology, come to my Valentine's Day lecture, listen carefully to the
big three and the more interesting four, and then go out there and put
them into practice? It feels a little bit like the--like we're trying
to pass on an acquired characteristic, which is a little bit counter to
Darwinian theory but if somehow you could design a proclivity for
learning this kind of material, evolution might indeed favor it. I can
tell you this much. It would make the several thousands social
psychologists in this world very happy and proud of their field, if
that turned out to be true. Anyway, thank you all very much. Happy
Valentine's Day! Thanks!</p>
