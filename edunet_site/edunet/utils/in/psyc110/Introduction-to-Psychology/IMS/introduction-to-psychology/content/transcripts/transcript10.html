<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: We began the course by talking about
one of the foundational ideas of modern psychology. This is what
Francis Crick described as "The Astonishing Hypothesis," the idea that
our mental life, our consciousness, our morality, our capacity to make
decisions and judgments is the product of a material physical brain.
What I want to talk about today and introduce it, and it's going to be
a theme that we're going to continue throughout the rest of the course,
is a second idea which I think is equally shocking, perhaps more
shocking. And this has to do with where mental life comes from, not
necessary its material nature, but rather its origin. And the notion,
this other "astonishing hypothesis," is what the philosopher Daniel
Dennett has described as Darwin's dangerous idea. And this is the
modern biological account of the origin of biological phenomena
including psychological phenomena.</p>

<p>Now, people have long been interested in the evolution of
complicated things. And there is an argument that's been repeated
throughout history and many people have found it deeply compelling,
including Darwin himself. Darwin, as he wrote <i>The Origin of
Species,</i> was deeply persuaded and moved by this argument from--in
the form presented by the theologian William Paley. So, Paley has an
example here. Paley tells--gives the example of you're walking down the
beach and your foot hits a rock. And then you wonder, "Where did that
rock come from?" And you don't really expect an interesting answer to
that question. Maybe it was always there. Maybe it fell from the sky.
Who cares? But suppose you found a watch on the ground and then you
asked where the watch had come from. Paley points out that it would not
be satisfying to simply say it's always been there or it came there as
an accident. And he uses this comparison to make a point, which is a
watch is a very complicated and interesting thing.</p>

<p>Paley is--was a medical doctor and Paley goes on to describe a watch
and compare a watch to the eye and noticing that a watch and the eye
contain multitudes of parts that interact in complicated ways to do
interesting things. In fact, to change and to update the analogy a
little bit, an eye is very much like a machine known as a camera. And
they're similar at a deep way. They both have lenses that bend light
and project an image onto a light-sensitive surface. For the eye the
light-sensitive surface is the retina. For the camera it's the film.
They both have a focusing mechanism. For the eye it's muscles that
change the shape of the lens. For a camera it's a diaphragm that
governs the amount of incoming light. Even they're both encased in
black. The light-sensitive part of the eye and part of the camera are
both encased in black. The difference is--So in fact, the eye and a
camera look a lot alike and we know the camera is an artifact. The
camera has been constructed by an intelligent--by intelligent beings to
fulfill a purpose.</p>

<p>In fact, if there's any difference between things like the eye and
things like a camera, the difference is that things like the eye are
far more complicated than things like the camera. When I was a kid I
had this incredible TV show called "The Six Million Dollar Man."
Anybody here ever seen it or heard of it? Oh. Anyway, the idea is
there's a test pilot, Steve Austin, and his rocket jet crashes and he
loses his--both legs, his arm and his eye, which sounds really bad but
they replace them with bionic stuff, with artificial leg, artificial
arm and an artificial eye that are really super-powered. And then he
fights crime. [laughter] It was [laughs] really the best show on. It
was really good, [laughter] but the thing is this was in 1974. It's now
over thirty years later and it's true then and it's true now, this is
fantasy. It doesn't make it to the level of science fiction. It's
fantasy. We are impossibly far away from developing machines that could
do this. We are impossibly far away from building a machine that can do
what the human eye does. And so somebody like Paley points out, "Look.
The complexity of the biological world suggests that these things are
complicated artifacts created by a designer far smarter than any human
engineer. And the designer, of course, would be God."</p>

<p>I went to Goggle Images. That--I don't mean that to be sacrilegious
[laughter] in any sense. You could try this. I went to "Google Images"
and typed in "God" and this [a picture of an old-bearded man wearing a
crown] is what showed up right in the middle so--And this, Paley
argued, and it was--has been convincing throughout most of history, is
a perfectly logical explanation for where these complicated things come
from. It also has the advantage of being compatible with scripture and
compatible with religious beliefs, but Paley made the point this stands
on its own. If you find complicated things that--complicated artifacts,
you don't assume they emerged by accident. You assume that they were
created by an intelligent being.</p>

<p>Now, this view has always had problems. This view, you could call it
"creationism," which is that biological structures were created by an
intelligent being, has always had problems. One problem is it pushes
back the question. So you ask, "Where did that intelligent being come
from?" And this is a particularly serious problem from the standpoint
of the evolution of psychological structures. So, we want to know, "how
is it that creatures came across--upon this earth with the ability to
reason and plan and do things?" And then the answer is "well, another
creature with that ability created us." That doesn't necessarily mean
it's wrong, but it means it's unsatisfying. You immediately want to get
an explanation for where that other creature comes from.</p>

<p>More to the point, there's always been evidence for evolution. And
what I mean by evolution here isn't necessarily a specific mechanism,
but merely the fact that body parts like the eye didn't emerge all of a
sudden, but rather have parallels both within other existing animals
and across human and biological history. This evidence comes in
different forms. There is fossil evidence for different body parts
suggesting that they have evolved from more rudimentary form. There is
vestigial characteristics. And what this means is there are
characteristics that human bodies have that are somewhat inexplicable,
like the human tailbone or goose-bumps, unless you view them--the human
body in its current form as modifications from a previous form.</p>

<p>There are parallels with other animals. And this is clear in
psychology. So, a human brain is different from the rat, cat, and
monkey brain but at the same time you see them following a sort of
common plan and common structures. And one rational inference from this
is that they're linked through evolutionary descent.</p>

<p>Finally, there is occasional poor design. So, Paley rhapsodized
about the remarkable powers of the human body and the different body
parts, but even Paley admitted that there are some things which just
don't work very well. Your eye contains a blind spot because of how the
nerves are wired up. In the male urinary system the urethra goes
through the prostate gland instead of around it, which leads to many
physical problems in men later on in life. And so you're forced to
either argue that these are really good things or that God is either
malicious or incompetent. And those are difficult arguments to
make.</p>

<p>So, these are problems with the creationist view. But still, for the
longest time in human intellectual history there was no alternative.
And in fact, Richard Dawkins, the most prominent evolutionary--one of
the most prominent evolutionary biologists alive and one of the most
staunchest critics of creationism, has written in <i>The Blind
Watchmaker</i> saying, look, anybody 100 years ago or 150 years ago who
didn't believe that God created humans and other animals was a moron
because the argument from design is a damn good argument. And in the
absence of some other argument you should go--defer to that. You should
say, "Well, there are all of these problems but humans and other
biological forms must have divine creation because of their incredible
rich and intricate structure." What changed all that of course was
Darwin. And Darwin--Darwin's profound accomplishment was showing how
you get these complicated biological structures, like the eye, emerging
through a purely non-intentional, non-created process, a purely
physical process. And this could be seen as equal in importance to the
claim that the Earth revolves around the Sun and that we're not the
center of the universe. And in fact, some scholars have made a
suggestion which seems plausible, that the idea of natural selection is
the most important idea in the sciences, period.</p>

<p>So, this is not a course in evolution and I expect people to have
some background. If you don't have a background in it, you could get
your background from external readings but also from--the Gray textbook
and the Norton readings will both--will each provide you with enough
background to get up to speed. But the general idea is that there are
three components to natural selection. There is variation. And this
variation gives rise to different degrees of survival and reproduction
and gets passed on from generation to generation and gives rise to
adaptations, what Darwin described as "that perfection of structure
that justly excites our imagination."</p>

<p>And the biological world has all sorts of examples. You look at
camouflage. Prior to Darwin one might imagine that some intelligent
creator crafted animals to hide from their prey. But now we have a
different alternative, which is that animals that were better hidden
survive better, reproduce more, and over the course of thousands,
perhaps millions of years, they've developed elaborate camouflage.
There's been a lot of work on Paley's favorite example – the eye. So
Darwin himself noted that the human eye did not seem to emerge all at
once but rather you could look at other animals and find parallels in
other animals that seem to suggest that more rudimentary forms are
possible. And more recently computer simulations have developed--have
been developed that have crafted eyes under plausible assumptions of
selective pressure and what the starting point is.</p>

<p>So, this is the theory of natural selection. The good question to
ask is, "why am I talking about evolution in Introduction to Psychology
class?" And the answer is that there are two ideas which come together.
And in fact, they're both of the dangerous ideas. One idea is that
Darwin's idea--that biological forms evolve through this purely
physical process. The second idea, the rejection of Descartes, is that
our minds are the product of physical things and physical events. You
bring these together and it forces you to the perspective that what we
are--our mental life is no less than the eye, no less than camouflage,
the product of this purely physical process of natural selection. More
to the point, our cognitive mechanisms were evolved not to please God,
not as random accidents, but rather for the purpose of survival and
reproduction. More contentiously, you could argue they've been shaped
by natural selection to solve certain problems. And so, from an
evolutionary point of view, when you look at what the brain is and what
the brain does, you look at it in terms of these problems. And this is
what psychology is for. This is what our thinking is for. We have
evolved mental capacities to solve different problems: perception of
the world, communication, getting nutrition and rest, and so on.</p>

<p>Now, we're going to talk about how to apply evolutionary theory to
psychology. But as we're doing so we have to keep in mind two
misconceptions. There are two ways you can go seriously wrong here. The
first is to think that, well, if we're taking an evolutionary approach
then natural selection will cause animals to want to spread their
genes. So, if we're being biological about it, that means everybody
must run around thinking "I want to spread my genes." I want to--and
this is just really --Oops. I shouldn't do that. This is really wrong.
It's [the text on the slides] even in red. And what this fails to do is
make a distinction between ultimate causation and proximate causation.
And those are technical terms referring to--Ultimate causation is the
reason why something is there in the first place, over millions of
years of history. Proximate causation is why you're doing it now. And
these are different. Obviously, for instance, animals do all sorts of
things to help survive and reproduce but a cockroach doesn't think "oh,
I'm doing this to help survive and reproduce and spread my genes." A
cockroach doesn't know anything about genes. Rather, the mechanisms
that make it do what it does are different from its own mental states,
if it has any--why it does them.</p>

<p>This is a point nicely made by William James. So, William James is
asked, "Why do we eat?" And he writes,</p>

<blockquote>Not one man in a billion when taking his dinner ever thinks
of utility. He eats because the food tastes good and makes him want
more. If you asked him why you should want to eat more of what tastes
like that, instead of revering you as a philosopher, he will probably
laugh at you for a fool.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And it's really the common sense answer. "Why are you eating?"
Nobody's going to answer, "Because I must sustain my body so as to
spread my genes in the future." Rather, you eat because you're
hungry.</p>

<p>Those two theories, you eat because you're hungry and you eat to
sustain your body so you could spread your genes in the future, are not
alternative. Rather, they're different levels of explanation. And you
can't confuse them. The ultimate level which does appeal to survival
and reproduction does not--is independent from the psychological level.
To give another example, people protect their children so you ask, "Why
do people protect their children? Why would somebody devote so much
effort to protecting and helping and feeding their children?" Well, the
evolutionary explanation is animals that don't protect their offspring
don't last over evolutionary time. We protect our offspring because
they contain fifty percent of our genes, but that's not the
psychological explanation. Nobody but a deranged psychologist would
ever answer, "Oh, I love my children because they contain fifty percent
of my genes." Rather, the psychological explanation is a deeper--is
different and has a different texture. And this will be a lot clearer
when we talk about the emotions, where you could really see a
distinction between the question of why we feel something from an
evolutionary point of view and why we feel it from a day-to-day point
of view.</p>

<p>The second misconception is that natural selection entails that
everything is adaptive, that everything we do, everything we think is
adaptive. This is wrong. Natural selection and evolution, more
generally, distinguish between adaptations and byproducts and
accidents. Many of you are currently, or will as you get older, suffer
back pain. If I was to ask you, "So, why do you suffer back pain? How
does back pain help you survive and reproduce?" Well, the answer is
it's not an adaptation. Back pain is an accidental byproduct of how our
backs are shaped. Don't go looking for an adaptive reason for hiccups
or self-pity or bloating after you eat. There's all sorts of things a
body will do that have no adaptive value, rather just accidents. We
have a body that does all sorts of things. Some things it will do by
accident and this is certainly true for psychology.</p>

<p>So, a lot of the things, for instance, that occupy our interest or
our fascination in day-to-day life are almost certainly evolutionary
accidents. The number--The three--Three of the main preoccupations of
humans are pornography, television, and chocolate but if I asked you,
"Why do you like porn?" and you'd say, "Because my ancestors who liked
porn reproduced more than those who didn't," [laughter] it's not true.
Rather, you like porn, assuming you do, [laughter] as an accident. You
have evolved--For instance, should you be a heterosexual male, you have
evolved to be attracted to women. That is most likely to be an
evolutionary adaptation because being attracted to women and wanting to
have sex with women is one step to the road to having kids, which is
very good from an evolutionary perspective.</p>

<p>It so happens, though, in our modern environment that people have
created images that substitute. So, instead of actually going out and
seeking out women you could just surf the web for hours and hours and
watch dirty movies and read dirty books – evolutionary adaptive dead
ends. They're accidents. Why do you like chocolate bars, assuming that
you do? It is not because your ancestors in the African savanna who
enjoyed chocolate bars reproduced more than those who didn't. Rather,
it is because we've evolved a taste for sweet things. And we've evolved
a taste for sweet things, in part, because the sweet things in our
natural environment like fruit were good for us. In the modern world we
have created things like chocolate, which are not so good for us but we
eat anyway.</p>

<p>A lot of the debates--There's a lot of controversy in psychology
over the scope of evolutionary explanations. And a lot of the debate
tends to be over what's an adaptation and what isn't. There are some
clear cases. We have color vision. Why do we have color vision? Well, I
think everybody would agree we have color vision as an adaptation
because of the advantages it gives us for seeing and making visual
distinctions. We are afraid of snakes. We're going to talk about that
in more detail but there's a straightforward adaptive story about that.
We are afraid of snakes because, really, our ancestors who weren't
afraid of snakes didn't reproduce as much as those that were. We like
chocolate bars and we enjoy NASCAR. Those cannot be adaptations because
chocolate bars and NASCAR are recent developments that could not have
been anticipated by evolution.</p>

<p>Those are easy questions. Here are some hard questions. Music.
Everywhere in the world people like music. Is this an adaptation for
some selective advantage or is it an accident? Steven Pinker, who wrote
<i>The Language Instinct</i> that you read before, caused a huge amount
of controversy when he argued that music is just an evolutionary
accident. He described it as auditory cheesecake, something we like to
gorge ourselves on that have no--has no adaptive advantage. Other
people argue music does have an adaptive advantage. Sometimes males use
violence to coerce sex. Is male sexual violence a biological adaptation
or is it an accident? There's more than one language. Is that just an
accidental byproduct of the way language works or is there some sort of
group or selectionist advantage sketched out in some way of having
multiple languages? What about visual art? What about fiction? What
about our love for stories? Those are all matters of heated debate.</p>

<p>And so, we have to keep in mind some things plainly are accidents.
Some things almost certainly aren't accidents. Where the action is in
the study of psychology and the study of evolution of cognition is
trying to figure out which is which. So, those are the misconceptions
we have to avoid. But still, who cares? Again this is an Introduction
to Psych course. Why are we talking about evolution? Why should it
matter to a psychologist how the mind has evolved? I'm going to talk
about evolution now but for the rest of the course I'm just interested
in how our minds are, period. S,o why would evolution matter?</p>

<p>Well, many people think it doesn't. For instance – and they think it
doesn't for different reasons – one claim is a metaphysical one. You
might be a dualist. You might reject the idea your mental life is the
product of your brain and hence evolution is irrelevant to psychology
because the brain and the mind--because the brain, which may have
evolved, has nothing interesting to do with the mind. Lisa Simpson got
it wrong when she said the Pope--She got it half right when she said
the Pope favored evolution. It is true. John Paul II, many years ago,
made a statement saying that Darwinian theory is not incompatible.
Darwinian theory is a view about the evolution of species that is not
motivated by any animus, is a genuine scientific theory, and should it
turn out to be true, it is not incompatible to truth about man as
taught by the Church. And scientists were thrilled by this and they
were--they said he's endorsing evolution. But what a fewer people talk
about is the fact that after he said this he drew the line. He allowed
for evolution of the body but he would not allow for evolution of the
mind. So it was--he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>If the human body takes its origin from preexisting living
matter, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God. Consequently,
theories of evolution which consider the mind as emerging from the
forces of living matter or as a mere epiphenomenon of this matter are
incompatible to the truth about man.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So, you might not want evolution to be true about the mind because
you might believe that the mind is not subject to the same physical
laws as the rest of the physical world. That's one way you could reject
evolutionary psychology. Another way to reject evolutionary psychology
is to accept that the mind is a physical thing but then argue that all
of these instincts and these hard-wired facets of human nature might
exist for other animals but they don't exist for people. So, the
anthropologist Ashley Montagu in '73, close to when <i>The Six Million
Dollar Man</i> was shown, by the way, said:</p>

<blockquote>With the exception of the reactions of infants to sudden
withdrawals of support and to sudden loud noises, the human being is
entirely instinctless. Man is man because he has no instincts, because
everything he is and has become he has learned from his culture, from
the man-made part of the environment, from other human
beings.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>You might say, "Look. He could believe that in '74 but, of course,
all of the infant studies that have come out since then suggested
that's not true and nobody would believe that nowadays." But in fact,
the view is often hold--held--Louis Menand in a <i>New Yorker</i>
article a few years ago wrote, "Every aspect of life has a biological
foundation in exactly the same sense, which is that unless it was
biologically possible it wouldn't exist. After that it's up for grabs."
And this is in the context of an argument that evolution can't tell us
anything about what's most interesting about people. Menand is not--is
an educated, intelligent scholar. He is presumably well aware of the
findings of Spelke and Baillargeon about how people are hard-wired to
understand the objects in social life and so on. But his point is just
that when it comes to the more interesting aspects of human nature, the
stuff we're naturally, intuitively interested in, that's more cultural.
And the evolutionary theory and Darwinian theory just doesn't have
anything much to say about it, not because the mind is separate from
the brain but just because humans are much more cultural organisms, and
so biology has little to say about it.</p>

<p>There's a third objection, which is you might think, "Okay, the
human mind actually does contain instincts. There is a human nature but
we should just study it by studying people. How could evolution, the
study of evolution, the consideration of evolution tell us anything
interesting?" I actually, in my own work, think evolution can tell us
some interesting things. And I want to try to make a case for ways in
which evolution can inform and enlighten us about the mind as it
is.</p>

<p>First, I want to make a point, which is although this course is
Intro Psych and it is about the mind as it is, still I think by any
account the evolution of consciousness, morality and so on, just is
intuitively interesting. It's the sort of thing that people are just
fascinated by and I think it's a question of interest in and of its own
right. But here's how it could tell us about psychology. For one thing,
it can tell us what can be innate and what cannot. So, some problems,
some evolutionary problems, have been around for a long time and could
lead to special biological adaptations. If I told you there is a
biological adaptation for talking, mate selection, childcare; maybe
it's true, maybe it isn't, but it's not crazy. From an evolutionary
point of view, it's a reasonable possibility that it is.</p>

<p>Other problems are recent and our brains could not be specialized to
deal with them: written communication, interacting with strangers,
driving a car, playing chess. If you were to argue that there's a part
of the brain devoted to playing chess, I would say you're utterly
wrong. You cannot be right because, from an evolutionary point of view,
there could be no such part of the brain evolved because playing chess
is a recent innovation. As a result, a focus on evolution could help
discipline us to make coherent claims about what is built-in and what
isn't built-in.</p>

<p>Third, we're going to talk about human differences in this course.
We're going to devote a class to human differences of the sort of what
makes you different from her, different from her. Why do we have
different intelligences in this class? Why are some of us arrogant and
some of us humble? Some of us like--attracted to men, others attracted
to women, and so on. But there's also questions of group differences.
And evolutionary theory can help us say intelligent things about what
sort of group differences you should expect because evolutionary theory
predicts that some populations should evolve in different ways than
others.</p>

<p>The most obvious example is that children should be different from
adults. The evolutionary problems faced by a child are very different
from the evolutionary problems faced by an adult. And you can make
specific and rather interesting predictions about how children's brains
should different--differ from adults' brains. Evolutionary theory
predicts--does not make any predictions about racial differences or
ethnic differences. Some might exist, but there's no adaptive reason
why humans who have evolved in different parts of the world should have
profound differences in their mental capacities.</p>

<p>What does evolutionary theory say about sex differences? Well, it
says some interesting things, and we're going to devote a class to
discussing them, but what I think is going to be true--proved to be
important is that we'll be able to use evolutionary biology to talk
sensibly about what sort of distinctions between the sexes, between
males and females, one would expect to find and what sort one wouldn't
expect to find. We can make educated predictions. I'm going to have--I
want to put here a clip of a man. This is a scene from a movie, the
movie "Roger Dodger," that begins with a man making quasi-evolutionary
claims about the differences between men and women. And I want to put
this as an example of what you could call "barroom evolutionary
psychology." And I want us to hold this in our minds because we're
going to return to these claims and discuss their validity. [clip
playing]</p>

<p>I like this for a few reasons. First, I like the backward reference
to William James and utility. Second, it is a gorgeous combination of
some things that are actually reasonably rational and total bull crap.
And--but what evolutionary biology will give us is the tools to
distinguish between the two. On the face of it immediately, the ability
to read maps, the claim that that has a biological--that differences in
that ability have a biological root is crazy. On the other hand, the
claim that one--that males may develop a trait not because it's
advantageous but to attract females is less crazy. The telepathic stuff
is really crazy but--;So, I'm not at this point--We're going to devote
a lecture to sex. I do not, at this point, want to make any claims one
way or another. But what I want to suggest is that from a biological
point of view we could say sensible and intelligent things about what
differences should exist and what shouldn't.</p>

<p>Finally, and most of all, looking at something from the perspective
of design, the perspective of what's it for, can often give you
interesting insights as to its current nature. And I'll give you two
quick examples, one that's not from psychology, one that is. Women
suffer--Often women who are pregnant early in their pregnancy suffer
from morning sickness, nausea, throwing up and so on. This has
traditionally been viewed as just a breakdown in the system--too much
hormones, everything's askew; women get nauseous. Margie Profet
suggested an alternative and this won her the <i>MacArthur Genius
Award.</i> And this was the claim that maybe pregnancy sickness is not
an accident; rather, it's designed, it has a biological purpose. In
particular, as the baby develops in the uterus, it is vulnerable to
various sorts of poisons or teratogens. Profet suggested that pregnancy
sickness is a hypersensitive period where women are extremely
sensitive, get extremely nauseous towards the sorts of foods that could
damage their baby.</p>

<p>Now, if she just ended there it's a story. How do we know it's true?
But then she went on to examine it the same way that any scientist
examines any claim – by making predictions and testing them. And this
makes some interesting predictions. It suggests the timing of onset and
offset of pregnancy sickness, of morning sickness, should correspond to
the period of maximal vulnerability on the part of the developing
embryo or fetus. Suggested the types of foods avoided should correspond
to those sorts of foods that were most deadly for the fetus and that
were deadly for the fetus during the periods where humans evolved. This
last qualification is an important one. Women do not develop an
aversion to alcohol during pregnancy even though alcohol is extremely
dangerous to the developing child. The answer is an easy one. Alcohol
wasn't around during our evolutionary history and we could not have
evolved a system to protect ourselves from it.</p>

<p>And finally, there should be a relationship between miscarriage and
birth defects in a surprising direction. For Profet, and she has
evidence to back this up, pregnancy sickness is not a glitch in the
system. Rather, it's the sign of a healthy act of protective mechanism
going on. And in fact, the more morning sickness the more the baby
should be protected. Something which, by and large, appears to be true.
That's an example of how the question--when dealing with this they say,
"Hey. Women throw up when they get pregnant" and then say, "Look. Maybe
that's not just a glitch. What's it for?" You could then learn some
interesting things.</p>

<p>Here's a different example based on the last lecture, this wonderful
lecture by Peter Salovey on sex and love where he talked about the "big
three." These are the "big three" to remind you of what attracts us to
somebody else. You are very attracted to the person next to you or a
person that--because of proximity, similarity, familiarity. And there
is abundant evidence supporting the truth of this. It's almost always
true but the evolutionary psychologist looks at this and says there's
something seriously wrong here. There are some cases where that has to
be totally, absolutely mistaken. To realize what this is, think for a
moment. What humans are you most close to, most similar to and most
familiar with? What humans did you spend over ten years of your life
with who are genetically and environmentally as close to you as if they
were related, who you are intimately familiar with? Are those the
humans that you find the hottest? [laughter] No. They're your siblings
and they are not hot. [laughter]</p>

<p>I was on Google Images this morning. I put up some hot siblings
and--but--although we may find them hot, they do not typically, with
some rare and bizarre exceptions, find [laughter] one another hot. Why
not? Well, this is not a huge puzzle from the standpoint of
evolutionary biology. Evolutionary biology posits that humans, as well
as other animals, should have incest avoidance. We should love--we
should be attracted to those familiar to us, similar to us, close to
us, but not kin. Kin are off limits. There is a good reason why.
Because if you inter-mate with your kin you have bad offspring
[laughter] and so animals should be wired up not to mate with their
kin. And in fact, this is what happens.</p>

<p>There are--Parents of teenagers have all sorts of concerns. And a
lot of the concerns are, in fact, sexual. How do you keep your son
and/or your daughter from going out and having sex with too many
people, or the wrong people, or unprotected sex? But there are no
parenting guides in the world that say "How do you keep your children
from having sex with one another?" [laughter] You typically do not need
to because they do not want to have sex with one another.</p>

<p>Now, this is--actually also illustrates the difference between
proximate and ultimate causation. So, you think for yourself, "Eew. Do
I want to have sex with my sister?" You don't think to yourself, "I
would prefer not to, for the offspring that we will create will be
nonviable and it'll be a waste of my reproductive efforts." Rather, you
think, "Eew," because at a gut level you respond. And this sort of
instinctive response is what you get from an evolutionary analysis of
sex.</p>

<p>But this story is deeply incomplete because the question that gets
raised is "how do you tell?" You don't want to have sex with your kin
but how do you tell your kin? People don't carry their DNA markers on
strips that you could see. How do you tell who your kin are? And this
actually turns out to be a really interesting question. It used--And
some research suggests that the answer is simple. You avoid sex with
people you grew up with. And these studies actually come from kibbutz
studies, studies where people are raised communally on an Israeli
kibbutz. They know they're not related, but still, the fact that they
were raised together as kids suggests that there's a cue at a gut level
not to be attracted to one another.</p>

<p>It turns out there's some reason now to believe this story is
incomplete. A paper that came out in <i>Nature</i> five days ago
reported a series of extremely interesting studies. And they found that
the cue of being raised together as a child with somebody--yes, that
does diminish sexual desire, but an even bigger cue was "did you
observe your parents, and in particular, your mother, taking care of
that person?" If you did, that seriously diminishes sexual desire and
brings it down to the level of disgust. And again, these are the sort
of questions and issues you begin to ask when you approach things from
an evolutionary perspective.</p>

<p>Okay. For this lecture--the rest of this lecture and then the next
couple of lectures, I'll be discussing some basic aspects of human
nature that are, to some extent or another, informed by evolutionary
theory. And what I want to start for the remainder of this lecture is a
discussion of rationality. Now, some of you maybe not want to go
into--not want to go into psychology because there's no Nobel Prize for
psychology. You might all think, "Hey, if I'm going to go into the
sciences I want a Nobel Prize. Think how proud Bubby and Zadie would be
if I won a Nobel Prize. Wouldn't that be the best?" You can get one.
Psychologists have won the Nobel Prize. Most recently, Danny Kahneman
won a Nobel Prize. You win it in economics, sometimes medicine; not a
big deal. He won it for his work done over the course of many decades
on human rationality. And this work was done in collaboration with Amos
Tversky, who passed away several years ago. And this work entirely
transformed the way we think about human decision-making and
rationality.</p>

<p>Kahneman and Tversky caused a revolution in economics, psychology,
and the social sciences more generally, by causing us to shift from the
idea that we're logical thinkers, who think in accord with the axioms
of logic and mathematics and rationality, more towards the idea that we
actually have sort of rough and ready heuristics. These heuristics
served us well during the time--during our evolutionary history, but
sometimes they can lead us astray. And I want to give some examples of
these heuristics. And I'll give four examples of heuristics that are
argued to permeate our reasoning.</p>

<p>The first is "framing effects." This was a classic study by Kahneman
and Tversky involving this sort of question. The U.S. is preparing for
the outbreak of a disease that's going to kill six hundred people.
There are two programs. Program A: If you follow it two hundred people
will be saved. Program B: There's a one-third chance everybody will be
saved and a two-third chance nobody will be saved. Who would choose
program B? Who would choose program A? Okay. And that fits the
responses. Most people choose program A. That's--It could go either
way. What's interesting is if you frame the question differently, like
this, you get very different responses. And instead of focusing on the
people who will be saved, you focus on the people who will die and,
instead of focusing on the chance that nobody will die and the chance
that everybody will die, you'd flip it around, you get a corresponding
flip. And this is known as a "framing effect."</p>

<p>The idea of a framing effect is that you could respond differently
to a situation depending on how the options are framed. And, in
particular, this combines with "loss aversion." People hate a certain
loss. "Four thousand of these people will die" is extremely aversive
and so the framing can influence your decisions. And clever advertisers
and clever decision makers will frame things in different ways to give
you--give rise to different intuitions. Sometimes this could be fairly
simple. So, you have this ad of a hamburger that's eighty percent fat
free versus twenty percent fat--You don't have to be a brilliant ad
executive to figure out which one to go for.</p>

<p>It turns out that this sort of fundamental act – the fundamental
role of framing effects – is not limited to humans. So, I want to take
a second and tell you some work done by my colleague, Laurie Santos,
with capuchin monkeys. And what she does is she takes these capuchin
monkeys and she teaches them to use money. She teaches them to use
little discs to buy themselves either pieces of banana or pieces of
apple. And they like to eat this. And they very quickly learn you can
hand over a disc to get some banana or some apple. [laughter] Now, Dr.
Santos and her colleagues have done many studies using this method, but
the study I'm interested in illustrating here shows framing effects in
these nonhuman primates.</p>

<p>So, what she does is--There's two options. In one option, the
experimenter shows one object to the capuchin and low--and then either
gives one or two--half the time gives one, half the time gives two, for
an average of one and a half. The other experimenter does exactly the
same thing; gives one or two for an average of one and a half, but
starts off displaying two. Now, if you weren't a human, how would you
feel about these two experimenters? They both give you the same amount.
And capuchins are extremely sensitive to how much they get, but it
turns out as predicted they don't like the pink experimenter because
the pink experimenter is--he gives you two--shows you two and half the
time he gives you one. This guy shows you one, and half the time gives
you two. And over time they develop a preference for the experimenter
that shows them one initially, suggesting that they are being subject
to framing effects or choices relative to a reference point.</p>

<p>A different sort of demonstration is the "endowment effect." This is
a robust and very interesting effect. Here's the idea. I show you
something like a cup or a chocolate bar and I say, "How much will you
give me for this chocolate bar? It looks like you're pretty hungry. How
much will you give me for this chocolate bar?" And you say, "I'll give
you two dollars for this chocolate bar." Most people on average give
two--the chocolate bar--gives two dollars for a chocolate bar. The
other condition's exactly the same except I hand you a chocolate bar
and say, "How much money will you sell me that chocolate bar for?"
There, people say, "Two fifty," and in fact, what happens is once you
own something its value shoots up. And this has mystified economists
and psychologists. It makes no sense. The chocolate bar doesn't even
have to move. I just leave it on the table and say either "How much
will you spend," "How much will you give me for this?" or "Okay. It's
yours. How much do you want for me to take it back?" The answer is,
it's framing. If you're asking how much you want for it, it's a game.
It's just how much will you pay to get something. But if you're being
asked how much do you want for me to take it from you, you treat it as
a loss. And as a loss it becomes more valuable. Those are framing
effects.</p>

<p>The second example is base rates. There are seventy lawyers--sorry,
seventy engineers and thirty lawyers and John is chosen at random. Let
me tell you about John: forty-years old, married, three children,
conservative, cautious, no interest in politics, awkward around people.
His hobbies include carpentry, sailing, and solving mathematical
puzzles, like online dating. [laughter] What do you think John is? A
lawyer or an engineer? Who thinks he's a lawyer? Good. Who thinks he's
an engineer? Okay. Most people think he's an engineer, but here's the
thing. You switch it. Right? Thirty engineers, seventy lawyers? It
doesn't change. People--No matter what this number is--these
numbers--it doesn't seem to change who you think he is or how confident
you are.</p>

<p>People look at John as an individual and they ignore the background
status of where he came from. They ignore base rates. Base rates are
very difficult to think about and I want to give you an example of
this. And the example will be on the slides for when you print them
out--print it out because you might want to work through it yourself.
But I'll give this to you quickly.</p>

<p>There's a disease that hits one in a thousand people, a pretty
common disease. There's a test for the disease and if you have it, it's
going to tell you you have it. It tests for a certain thing in your
blood and "boom," if the thing is in your blood the test will go
"boom." If you have it, it will tell you you have it. It doesn't miss.
On the other hand, it's not perfect. It has a false positive rate of
five percent. So, if you don't have the disease, five percent of the
time the test will say you have it. So, if the test says you don't have
it, you're fine. But if the test says you have it, maybe you have it
but maybe it's a false positive. You take the test. It says you have
the disease. Without pen and paper, how likely do you think the odds
are you have the disease? Who says over fifty percent? Okay. Before
people sinisterly shouted the right answer, people will tend--medical
students were given this, medical students less savvy than you, and the
average is between fifty percent and ninety-five percent.</p>

<p>The answer is, as some people quickly noted, two percent. And here's
how it works. One percent of a thousand will have the disease. That
person will test positive. The test never misses. That leaves nine
hundred ninety-nine people who don't have the disease, and we'll say
about fifty percent of these people have it. So, for every fifty-one
people who test positive, only one will have the disease, giving an
average of about two percent. This sort of thing is very difficult. Our
minds are not evolved to do base rate computation. And so, any problems
involving base rate computation, including real world problems, like
what to do when you come back with a positive test, we screw up. And
often we screw up in the direction of panic.</p>

<p>The third bias is the "availability bias." And this is simply that
if you want to know how frequent something is, how available it is to
come to mind is an excellent cue. But this could lead to mistakes. A
classic example by Kahneman and Tversky is you ask people--one group of
people how many English words end with "ng" or what proportion of
English words, another group of people what proportion end with "ing."
It turns out you get much bigger numbers for "ing" than "ng" though, of
course "ng" has to--"ing"--sorry, "ng" would include everything with
"ing." It's just a lot easier to think about these things.</p>

<p>This can show up in the real world. What are your risk of getting
killed--What's your risk of getting killed by a shark? Well, if you ask
people what their risk of getting killed by a shark is, they
characteristically overestimate it. I will give you the news of what
the risk is for getting killed by a shark. Injured in any given year:
one in six million. Killed: one in five hundred million. If you live in
Florida, which apparently is Shark Central, your chance of getting
injured is about one in a half million. People will overestimate the
risks because shark attacks are very salient. They are always reported
in the news and they're very interesting. What is the chance of getting
killed by potato salad? [laughter] Well, food poisoning, death by food
poisoning, injury by food poisoning runs to about one in fifty-five,
one in 800 for some sort of injury and one in 55,000 killed. Potato
salad is 1,000 more times more dangerous than shark attacks. But you
get it wrong because you don't think, "Oh, my God, big news story.
Somebody dies by potato salad." [laughter] And so, we tend to
overestimate the chance of being killed by dramatic effects.</p>

<p>How many Jews in the United States, what proportion? Who thinks it's
over three quarters of the United States is Jewish? [laughter] I'm kind
of anchoring here. Okay. Okay. Who thinks over half? Who thinks over
forty percent? Who thinks over twenty percent? Okay. Who thinks over
fifteen percent? Who thinks over ten percent? Who thinks over seven and
one-half percent? Who thinks over five percent? Okay. Who thinks
overall there's more than five percent of the United States that's
Jewish? Who thinks over three percent? The answer is somewhere between
1.9 and 2.1%. Most people think--The average American thinks it's
twenty percent. There is-- [laughter] If you're curious about
demographics, and this map isn't to be entirely trusted because I got
it from Wikipedia, [laughter] this is the distribution of the Jewish
population, self-identified as Jewish in different parts of the United
States. [laughter] New York City is, of course, the most dense
population with nine percent. New Haven has 3.5%.</p>

<p>Now, why do people get it wrong? Well, there's all sorts of reasons
and this is going to come out in the context of social psychology when
we talk about how people think about human groups. But one quick answer
is people who are plainly Jewish are prominent in positions where
people notice them, like entertainment or, in the case of you guys,
academia. And this could lead to--this availability-- "Can I think of a
Jew? Yeah." [laughter] This availability causes us to overestimate the
proportion to which Jews are represented in the population.</p>

<p>Final example. Confirmation bias. This is a very nice study and it's
very simple. It's--You're in a jury of a custody case. You have to give
a child custody – either a mother or father sole custody. One parent
has average income, average health, average working hours, reasonable
rapport with the child, and a relatively stable social life. The second
parent has an above-average income, minor health problems, lots of
work-related travel, a very close relationship with the travel--with
the child, and an extremely active social life. Think for a moment. Who
would you award custody with? There's no--Obviously, there's no right
answer here.</p>

<p>Just think for a moment. Who would award custody to parent A? Who
would award custody to parent B? Okay. As I think there is in this
room, when this study is done there's a slight advantage to parent B.
Here's what's interesting. You give another group of people this
question. "Which parent would you deny custody to?" You get a slight
advantage for parent B. Now, this is to some extent an illustration of
framing problem but it's also a more general illustration of the
confirmation bias. So, when you're asked to award custody to, you then
ask, "Well, what is a good--what is a sign that somebody's a good
parent?" And the good parent aspects of B jump out. When asking about
denying custody you ask, "Where is a cue that somebody's a bad parent?"
And the bad parent aspects of B jump out. In general, when we have a
hypothesis we look for confirmations.</p>

<p>This makes some things, which are logically easy extremely difficult
problems when we face them in the real world. And I'll end with my
final example, that of the Wason selection task. Here's the game. And
people--I don't want people to shout it out just yet. There is four
cards [pointing to a slide depicting four cards: D, G, 3, 8]. Each card
has a letter on one side and a number on the other side. You have to
judge whether this claim is true or false. "If a card has a 'D' on one
side, it has a '3' on the other side." How many cards do you have to
turn over to test whether that rule is right? Okay. Somebody shout out
what one card is you have to turn over. "D." Everybody gets that right.
What else? Do you need to do any other cards? How many people think
it's "D" and "3"? I'm raising my hand to fool you. [laughter] People
answer either "D" or "D" and "3" but think about it. What would make
this rule wrong? It's wrong if it has "D" on one side and not "3" on
the other. Right? That's what it would be to be wrong. You then would
have to check "D" to see if there is a "3" on the other side. You were
all right about that. That means you'd check "8" to see if there's a
"D" on the other side. "Three's" not going to tell you anything. That's
hard. People find this very hard.</p>

<p>Okay. Big deal. But what's interesting is you can modify it in
certain ways to make it a lot easier. And this is the work of Leda
Cosmides and her colleague, an evolutionary psychologist at Santa
Barbara who has argued that if you frame these questions in ways that
make ecological sense, people are much better at them. And basically,
she does studies where she has people who are evaluating a social rule.
Imagine these cards. On one side of the card is an alcohol--is a drink.
On the other side is a person's age. You are a bartender and you want
to make sure nobody under twenty-one drinks beer. Which cards do you
turn over? Well, now it's easier but the logic is the same. It's a
violation that there's "under twenty-one" on one side, "beer" on the
other side, so you need to check the "under twenty-one" here and you
need to check the "beer" here. And when you make these logical problems
more ecologically valid they turn out to be much easier.</p>

<p>Okay. There's a little bit more but I'll hold it off until next
class. And I'll end with the reading response, which is to do your own
bit of reverse engineering and evolutionary psychology. And I'll see
you all on Wednesday.</p>
