<h2>PSYC 110: <strong>Introduction to Psychology </strong>(Spring, 2007)</h2>

<h3>Syllabus</h3>
<h4>Professor:</h4>

<p class="lastParagraph">Paul Bloom, Professor of Psychology, Yale
University</p>
<h4>Description:</h4>

<p class="lastParagraph">What do your dreams mean? Do men and women differ in the nature and intensity of their sexual desires? Can you trust the testimony of a young child? Can people repress terrible memories? Why are some people depressed? Can apes learn sign language? Why can't we tickle ourselves? Are humans inherently evil? This course tries to answer these questions, providing a comprehensive overview of the scientific study of thought and behavior. It explores topics such as perception, communication, learning, memory, decision-making, religion, persuasion, love, lust, hunger, art, fiction, and dreams. We will look at how these aspects of the mind develop in children, how they differ across people, how they are wired-up in the brain, and how they break down due to illness and injury. </p>
