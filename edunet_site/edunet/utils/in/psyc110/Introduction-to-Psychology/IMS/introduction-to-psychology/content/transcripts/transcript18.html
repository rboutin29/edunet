<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> I am extremely pleased to introduce the
fourth and final guest lecture of the semester. Professor Susan
Nolen-Hoeksema. Susan is a professor in the Department of Psychology
and the Director of Graduate Studies. She is well known for her work in
clinical psychology and especially her research in depression, the
nature and causes of people with depression, with special focus on sex
differences in depression. She basically does everything someone can
do. She is a noted scientist, winning many awards and publishing
massive amounts of work in scientific journals. She is an award-winning
teacher and has authored what, in my mind, is the very best textbook in
her area. And she's a noted popular writer who has written popular and
accessible books bringing the message and ideas and theories of
clinical psychology to the broader public. The only other thing I'll
mention before we welcome her is that she's going to teach next year
her course in clinical psychology, which has a superb reputation as an
extremely interesting course. If you are interested in what you hear
today and you want to learn more about it, that's the course you should
take. So, let's please welcome Dr. Susan Nolen-Hoeksema. [applause]</p>

<p><b>Professor Susan Nolen-Hoeksema:</b> Thank you Paul. Can everybody
hear me okay? Okay. So, what I want to do today is to give you a very
brief overview of how modern clinical psychology looks at mental
disorders, some of the ways we think about what constitutes a mental
disorder, some of the characteristics that kind of cut across mental
disorders, and then I'm going to use the case of mood disorders, that
is depression and what is now called bipolar disorder, what you may
know more popularly as manic-depression, as sort of examples of how we
think about a particular set of disorders and some of the ways we go
about researching the theories -- different theories for the disorders
and some of the prominent treatments for disorders these days. Okay?
So, I'm going to do both a fair amount of lecturing, and then I've got
lots of video clips to show you as well. So, I'm going to be roaming
around and changing venues here fairly often.</p>

<p>So, the first and most fundamental question in clinical psychology
is, "What is abnormality?" Where do we draw the line between normal,
healthy, typical behavior and what we might want to call abnormal,
atypical, deviant, unhealthy, maladaptive mental problems? We tend to
have an intuitive sense of what we mean by abnormality, and we'd like
to believe--a lot of people who come into my course say, "Well, of
course, you know, you guys have figured it out. You know where to draw
the line. You have criteria. You have blood tests, right? --that tell
me whether I have depression or schizophrenia or one of the things I've
read about." Well, the reality is that we don't.</p>

<p>First of all, there is no biological test for any of the known
mental disorders right now. And instead what we have is a set of
behavioral criteria for how to diagnose different mental disorders. And
what I mean by behavioral criteria is a set of symptoms that the person
reports to you about how they feel, how they think, and a set of
observations about their behavior and how typical or atypical it is.
And you take the sort of set of symptoms the person shows or reports,
and you match them up against the existing criteria for different
mental disorders. And then it comes down to a fairly subjective
judgment call about whether the person meets the criteria or not.
Unfortunately, these judgment calls, because they are so subjective,
can be influenced by a lot of factors. And we won't have a chance to go
into these too much today, but just to highlight a few of them.</p>

<p>The first is social norms. Whether you get labeled as having a
mental disorder or a problem depends very heavily on what your social
or cultural norms are. So, a woman wearing a veil in a Muslim community
or culture would be seen as typical, even prescribed, behavior. Whereas
a woman wearing a veil in a non-Muslim culture, especially until fairly
recently, was often looked upon as very atypical or abnormal
behavior.</p>

<p>The second kind of thing that gets--that influences whether
something is called normal or abnormal is certain characteristics of
the target person. In particular, I've highlighted here, gender.
Whether you're a man or you're a woman really influences how unusual a
certain behavior is. So, crying is a good example. A man crying in our
culture is seen as fairly unusual, whereas a woman crying is seen as
much less unusual. On the other hand, a woman beating up someone is
taken as quite unusual behavior where it's less unusual for a man. So,
we have gender stereotypes, gender roles for what is acceptable
behavior, and our judgments as to whether something is normal or
abnormal get influenced by those gender roles.</p>

<p>And the third thing that can influence whether something is labeled
abnormal or not is the context. And here I'm giving you the example of
"paranoia." If you're paranoid and hyper-vigilant, looking for threat
in downtown Baghdad, that's considered very adaptive behavior these
days because it could prevent you from getting hurt or killed. Whereas,
if you're in a quiet little farm in Central Connecticut, being
extremely paranoid and believing there's someone who's going to shoot
you around the corner is not considered as normal or as acceptable or
adaptive behavior. So, the context in which you exhibit a particular
behavior also can heavily influence whether it gets labeled by others
as normal or abnormal.</p>

<p>In the field of clinical psychology we have a number of different
ways, kind of heuristics that we use to label things as abnormal or
unhealthy or troubling. And three of these characteristics are what we
often call the three Ds: distress, dysfunction, and deviance. So,
behaviors that cause the individual or others significant distress
often get labeled as abnormal or unhealthy. Depression is a prime
example, as we'll see when we talk about the characteristics of it.
It's a miserable state of being; you're unhappy, you're sad, you may
even feel so badly you want to kill yourself. And that very, very high
level of distress is part of the reason why it's labeled as a mental
disorder. Other mental disorders don't cause the individual distress,
but they may cause other people distress.</p>

<p>So, one example of this is something called "antisocial personality
disorder," where the individual has no regard for the rights of other
people, has no hesitation to steal or--steal from or hurt other people,
has no empathy or sympathy for other people's feelings and so can
inflict a lot of harm on other people and has absolutely no distress
over this whatsoever. But this behavior causes other people distress,
and that's one of the reasons why that's labeled an abnormal behavior
or a mental health problem.</p>

<p>The second general criterion is "dysfunction." If a set of behaviors
prevents the person from functioning in daily life, then it might be
labeled as abnormal or might end up being labeled as a mental health
problem. Again, depression is a good example. People who are depressed
often become completely non-functional. They can't get up and go to
class; they can't go to work; they can't interact with their friends;
they withdraw and become totally isolated socially. So, they might lose
their job; they might flunk out of school. And this complete decline in
functioning is one of the major reasons that we consider depression one
of the most debilitating disorders.</p>

<p>And then finally, "deviance," the behaviors or feelings are highly
unusual. This is probably the most controversial of the three because
it weighs, it is so heavily influenced by the social norms. What's
deviant in one culture is not deviant in another culture. But if a set
of behaviors is completely unacceptable to a culture, highly unusual,
they're more likely to end up getting labeled as abnormal.</p>

<p>Okay. So, how do we pull this all together? Well, these days the
manual for making diagnoses in clinical psychology and psychiatry in
the United States is called the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual</i> or the <i>DSM</i>, and it's in its fourth revision. It's
been around since the, I believe the '50s, and the early editions in
the '50s and '60s were highly subjective and based on Freudian theory.
But since 1980 there's been real effort to make the criteria much more
objective, to make the set of behaviors or observations that are
required to diagnose someone be things that are observable, that you
can see in other people that they can report on reliably, and that one
clinician and another clinician will agree upon. So, the <i>DSM</i>
gives lists of symptoms with the required symptoms for a diagnosis, the
number of symptoms that have to be present, and the notions of
deviation, dysfunction and distress are built into these criteria. And
I'm going to give you a couple of examples of these criteria when we
talk about the specific types of mood disorder.</p>

<p>So as I said, I'm going to use mood disorders as kind of a case
example here of how we go about diagnosing and understanding
psychopathology, but I also just want to impart some information
because mood disorders are one of the most common problems that people
face. As many as one in four women will have an episode of serious
depression at some time in her life, and about 13% of men will have an
episode of serious depression in their lives. So, these are extremely
common kinds of problems that people experience, particularly at your
age. The college years are one of the peak times of onset, first onset,
of depression in particular. And also, for bipolar disorder, or
manic-depression, the late adolescent, early 20s are the peak onset
times for these disorders as well.</p>

<p>So, the mood disorders divide into what's called unipolar depression
disorders, which is depression only and then bipolar disorders where
the person cycles between depression and mania. And here are the
<i>DSM</i> criteria for major depression, one of the most severe forms
of depression. And as I said, the <i>DSM</i> sets up these relatively
observable criteria and how many you have to have and what absolutely
has to be present in order to get the diagnosis. So, the first
criterion in the <i>DSM</i> for major depression is that the individual
has to either show sadness or a diminished interest or pleasure in
their usual activities, which is referred to as anhedonia. So, you have
to have one or the other of these to sort of pass the first criterion.
So, you might say that you feel sad and blue and just--or actually say
you feel depressed. Some people feel those feelings very strongly.
Other people don't really feel so sad or blue, but what they'll say is
that nothing interests them anymore. It's like the emotion has been
sucked out of their life altogether. They don't have any fun doing the
activities they used to do before. They don't want to hang with their
friends. They just--they don't care about eating. Just nothing feels
right, feels good, anymore.</p>

<p>And then the individual has to have four of the--at least four of
the following symptoms in addition to sadness or anhedonia. First, they
can show significant weight or appetite change. So, you may completely
lose your interest in eating and lose a lot of weight, or some people
go on eating binges. I had a very good friend who was depressed for
about a year, and she gained fifty pounds because she would just eat.
She would binge eat, especially at night.</p>

<p>There are sleep disturbances--insomnia, which is having trouble
sleeping, or hypersomnia, which is sleeping all the time. There's a
particular form of insomnia that's especially likely in depression
where you can go to sleep at night, but then you wake up at about three
or four in the morning every night and you can't go back to sleep at
all. You're just up for the rest of the night. But other people want to
sleep all day long, and in the clip I'm going to show you in just a
minute the woman talks about sleeping twenty, twenty-two hours a day,
getting up, eating a little bit, and then going back to bed because she
was exhausted still.</p>

<p>The third criterion is psychomotor retardation or agitation. The
retardation is much more common, and what this means is that sort of
everything about the person's movement is slowed down. They'll walk
more slowly. Their reaction times will be slowed down. And because
they're so much more slow moving, depressed people are often more prone
to accidents. They just can't react as quickly as they need to when
they're driving or when they're crossing the road and a car is coming
at them suddenly. So, they get into more accidents. And their speech
may be slowed down. They may talk very, very slowly and it's as though
it just takes a tremendous amount of energy to get even a common
sentence out. A much more, much smaller number of people get agitated
instead of slow down. They may be hyper and just feel like they can't
sit still and such, but the agitation is much more rare than the
retardation. People feel really tired, fatigued and like they have
absolutely no energy. They can't get up and can't get moving. As I
said, they may want to just sleep all of the time.</p>

<p>Number five is feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt. They
may feel as though everything is their fault, and the guilt feelings or
sense of worthlessness can even get psychotic. They can lose touch with
reality. When a person loses touch with reality when they're depressed,
it typically has really depressing themes. They may believe that they
are Satan and that they have to commit suicide because they're
inflicting evil on the world. They may believe as though random events
are their fault, you know, that a flood that just happened somehow they
caused. So, the feelings of worthlessness and guilt can get completely
out of touch with reality, psychotic. More commonly, they're just
unrealistic. They're negative self-esteem, just being down on yourself,
feeling stupid and worthless and ugly and bad.</p>

<p>Number six is diminished ability to concentrate or indecisiveness.
When you are depressed it's really hard to pay attention. You'll read a
passage over and over again and you just can't process it at all. You
can't concentrate on a lecture so going to class is just useless. You
have to make a decision about what a paper topic is, and it just seems
like the most monumental thing on earth. You just can't decide
anything, you can't think anything; your thoughts are completely
clouded and overwhelmed.</p>

<p>And then suicidal ideation or behavior; it means you think about
committing suicide, you think about dying. And a subset of people
actually take action to try to hurt themselves or kill themselves. Now,
it should be said that suicidal thoughts and behavior don't only happen
in depression. They actually happen in all types of psychopathology,
but they're particularly common in depression.</p>

<p>So, you have to have at least one--four of those symptoms plus
sadness or anhedonia, and these symptoms--it can't just be a bad day
that you're having. These symptoms have to be present persistently for
at least two weeks to get the diagnosis. Now, truth be told, most
episodes of major depression actually last a lot longer than two weeks.
In fact, the average length of an episode, if it's not treated, is at
least six months. So, people stay this miserable for a very long period
of time, but the minimum criterion in the <i>DSM</i> is at least two
weeks.</p>

<p>So, what I want to do is to just show you a short clip of a woman
who has had a lot of episodes of depression. Fortunately, at the moment
she's not in an episode. But she can speak very articulately about what
it's like to be in the midst of an episode and some of the significant
symptoms that she had. [video clip plays]</p>

<p>Okay. There are couple of things she talks about that I just want to
comment on. One is this differentiation between everyday sad mood and
the kind of depressions we all experience and the kind of debilitating,
overwhelming depression that she experiences. And it is true that there
is this continuum from getting bummed out because you didn't do well on
a test or because you broke up with a boyfriend or girlfriend or
something like this and being completely not functional, vegetative,
the way that this woman becomes whenever she gets depressed. And it
would be nice if we were really sure where the cutoff was between those
normal everyday depressions and what's really a disorder. But the
reality is we don't really have real clear demarcation lines. There are
a lot of people who have more moderate forms of depression than Tara
here talks about but who still would qualify for a diagnosis and are
still suffering and impaired by their symptoms. So, I don't want you to
get the sense that if you don't have the kind of horrible version on
the extreme end of the continuum of depression that Tara has, then
there's nothing wrong with you, because that's not the case. People who
are really slowed, whom their functioning is interfered with--they're
just really unhappy with life--have problems that can be helped and do
need attention. And it is the case that much more moderate forms of
depression can morph into more serious forms if they're left untreated.
So, there is this continuum.</p>

<p>The other things I wanted to comment on that she talks about early
on in this piece is the fact that she hauls herself up and goes through
her day, even when she's feeling really, really depressed. And there is
this characteristic of a lot of depressed people that I call the
"walking wounded." They just haul themselves through the day trying to
act normal, trying not to let anybody know that there's anything wrong
with them, trying to keep up with their schoolwork or their employment.
But they're miserable and they're not functioning at the level that
they're capable of and such. And that's something that's very, very
common, and it's in part because people don't feel as though they
should have to get treatment or they're ashamed of getting treatment or
seeking help for depression. And so, they just keep going on and going
on, sometimes for years, in a very sorry state before--sometimes they
just--they end up actually falling apart to the point where they have
to get help.</p>

<p>Okay. The other category of mood disorders that I mentioned is
bipolar disorders. And as I said, bipolar disorder involves symptoms or
periods of depression but then also distinct periods of the opposite of
depression, which we call "mania." So, the person cycles back and forth
between debilitating depressions and manic episodes. So, let me
describe manic episodes to you now.</p>

<p>So, the first criterion is that instead of feeling down, blue or
depressed the person has an abnormally and persistently elevated
expansive or irritable mood that isn't just, again, a good day because
you won a prize or got an "A," but rather, it's this unusually
positive, expansive mood for at least one week persistently. And then
the person has to have three or more of the following symptoms.</p>

<p>First, inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. The individual may feel
as though they are the smartest, the most creative, insightful,
powerful person on earth, and they are perfectly happy to tell you
this. So, there is no problem with self-esteem, thank you very much.
"If you can't keep up with me it's your fault." There's a decreased
need for sleep; they may only sleep a couple of hours a night and get
up raring to go. They tend to be more talkative than usual, and there's
a really pressure to their talk. They'll talk really pressured, and
they'll talk really, really fast. And one of the reasons they're
talking really, really fast is they have this flight of ideas. The
thoughts are just racing through their mind, and they can't talk fast
enough to get them out. And if you can't follow them, that--well,
that's because you're not smart enough to follow them. But they've just
got too many good ideas and they've got to get them out.</p>

<p>They're highly distractible. And then there is this increase in
this--what the <i>DSM</i> calls this "goal-directed activity." Out of
their grandiosity will come these grand schemes for--often for making a
lot of money and they'll pursue these with great vigor no matter how
totally irrational they are. So, it's not at all uncommon for them to
cash out all the family bank accounts, to sell the house, to sell the
car, to sell the kids so that they can finance this great scheme for
making a zillion dollars on the Internet tomorrow. Right? Okay. And
they'll pursue this with tremendous vigor.</p>

<p>They'll also get involved in all kinds of, what the <i>DSM</i>
discreetly calls "pleasurable but dangerous activities." There's a lot
of sexual promiscuity, a lot of drug abuse, a lot of, as I said,
getting--going and gambling, believing that you're on a hot streak,
there's nothing can stop you. You know, you're just so brilliant and
you've got this scheme, you've got the plan. You're going to make it.
Okay? So, the individual has three of more of these kinds of symptoms
plus this elevated, expansive and often quite irritable mood. It's not
just that they're happy, you know, and sort of upbeat. It's just that
they're just impatient and irritable and trigger-fire. And sometimes
they can become violent because they're just--they're so incredibly
agitated and irritable.</p>

<p>So, let me show you a couple of clips. I have one really short one.
It's not a real high quality clip, but it's a very, very nice example
of an older woman who is in the midst of a manic episode. And it shows
what this kind of agitation and flight of ideas and racing thoughts can
look like. And then the other one is--I'll introduce whenever you--we
do it. [video clip plays]</p>

<p>Okay. So while she was at the hairdresser's it's a nice example of
how she was just pressured to speak. Nobody was telling her that she
had to say all of these things. They were just standing there with a
camera and she was going on and on and on about these things. And as
you could see she was getting more and more agitated and more and more
irritated as she was retelling her story. And then what? In the last
little bit there you saw her flip from her mania into a more depressed
state. And this poor lady, unfortunately, is having a hard time finding
a stable point. He talked about lithium there, and I'll talk about it
in a little bit--about the use of lithium as a drug to try to stabilize
these mood swings. But at this point in this video, it's not working
for this lady. And so, she's flipping back and forth, but they're
having a hard time finding that middle ground.</p>

<p>So, I want to show you another clip--it's a little bit longer--of a
man who has bipolar disorder. He is not currently in an episode of
either depression or mania, but again, he can talk about some of the
things he got himself into and how it manifested in his behavior.
[video clip plays] Hypomania is a more mild version of mania, but it's
the same symptoms. [video clip resumes]</p>

<p>Okay. Just a couple of things that Bernie talks about that I want to
comment on. One is that just as in depression, mania has--runs along a
continuum. So, it can be relatively mild all the way to extremely
severe and even psychotic. So, when a person with mania loses touch
with reality, instead of having beliefs that they are Satan or they've
done some horrible thing, they'll believe that they are some
supernatural being. They may believe that they are the Messiah or that
they are Albert Einstein, you know, come back to life, or that they
have supernatural powers or something of this sort, so that their false
beliefs, their delusions and their hallucinations, the things that they
see and hear that aren't really there tend to be very grandiose in
their themes. Bernie's mania is not on the far end of the continuum by
any stretch, but you can see it still gets him into trouble.</p>

<p>Now, there are people who have--who cycle between fairly low levels
of mania and fairly low levels of depression, back and forth. And
there's been some argument that people who are kind of chronically,
mildly manic--especially if they're really smart or they have a special
talent – can make it work for them. And there is a wonderful book by
Kay Jamison, who is a professor at Johns Hopkins where she
chronicles--She does sort of historical biographies on a number of
well-known authors and poets and musicians, Robert Schumann and a
number of politicians, Winston Churchill and such, arguing that they
actually had mild forms of bipolar disorder and that they were able to
sort of channel the manic episodes through extraordinary talent or
intelligence in ways that made it work for them. There are also a
number of arguments that very, very successful CEOs sometimes are
people who are chronically slightly manic. They can go on a couple of
hours a night of sleep; they're obviously really quite grandiose and
self-confident, and that they can maintain this kind of moderate level
of mania, keep it under control and channel it in ways that work for
them. So, if you're interested in that book, send me an email and I'm
happy to send you the citation for it.</p>

<p>But for the most part, mania can get people into tremendous trouble.
They can, as I said, get involved in sexual promiscuity that puts them
at risk for sexually transmitted diseases. They can get involved in
drug activity. They can get themselves arrested. They can certainly
send themselves and their family into bankruptcy. And these kinds of
negative consequences of the mania often are what motivates the person
to get help because the mania itself can be rather pleasurable to have.
Also, what motivates them to get help is the plunge into depression,
the knowledge that they will, at some point, come out of the mania and
go into a debilitating depression.</p>

<p>Bipolar disorder is much less common than depression. I said that
about 22% of women and about 13% of men will have an episode of serious
depression at some time in their lives. Bipolar disorder occurs in only
about 1% of the population, and it's equally prevalent in women and
men. So, it's a really quite different disorder in many ways from
depression alone.</p>

<p>I want to give you some other statistics about depression per se,
and this only applies to depression. There are quite large age
differences in the prevalence of depression. These are data from a
nationwide study of people between the ages of fifteen and fifty-five,
and these are the percentages of people in this study. And there were
several thousand people in the study. These are not people who have
sought treatment for depression but just a random community sample. And
this is the percentage who've had an episode of major depression in the
past month. And as you can see, the fifteen to twenty-four age range
has the highest rates, and then they go down somewhat, although the
thirty-five to forty-four is fairly high as well with age. You might be
surprised to learn that the rates of major depression in the elderly
are actually quite low by most national statistics. And that's true up
to about age eighty or eighty-five. And the arguments for why this is
the case are very interesting.</p>

<p>There are some people who argue that as you get older you get wiser,
and so that's why we see lower rates of depression in older age. There
are other people who argue that current generation--younger generations
now; your generation and the one above you--are more prone to
depression and will be for the rest of your life compared to your
grandparents, because of historical changes in the kinds of social
support and family networks available and a number of other historical
cultural changes. The other sort of side of the argument is that
because depression is known to impact negatively your physical health –
depression is associated with higher rates of cardio-vascular disease,
stroke, immune system diseases, a whole host of diseases that people
die from--that people who have a lifelong history of depression are
actually more likely to die at an earlier age, and that's why we see
relatively low rates in older age people. We don't know yet which of
these explanations is true. It may be that they're all true to some
extent.</p>

<p>There are also gender differences in depression. These are data from
a compilation of hundreds of studies of children and adolescents,
looking at not full-blown depression but levels of depression on
self-report questionnaires. Probably most of you have filled out these
questionnaires, like the <i>Beck Depression Inventory</i> that ask you
how you've been feeling in the last month. And there's a kiddy version
of this, and these are data from that, from several thousand children.
And as you can see here, prior to the age of about thirteen, boys and
girls have relatively similar levels of depression. But beginning
around the pubertal years, girls' rates of depression go up quite
dramatically and boys' rates stay the same or go down. And by the time
they're eighteen or twenty you get almost a two-to-one ratio of
depressed girls to depressed boys. And then this is true for the rest
of the adult age span.</p>

<p>There are lots of hypotheses about this, why it's true. There are
biological hypotheses that have to do with hormones. There are
sociological hypotheses that have to do with the kinds of stress, and
particularly abuse, in girls' lives relative to boys'. We don't know
exactly why. It's probably a lot of these things coming together that
make this huge two-to-one ratio true.</p>

<p>So, let's talk a little bit about the major theories and treatments
for the mood disorders. There are biological theories and treatments,
what are known as cognitive behavioral theories and treatments and then
interpersonal theories and treatments. And I'll walk you through
examples of each of these.</p>

<p>So, first, genetics. It's pretty clear that genetics are involved in
the mood disorders, especially bipolar disorder. There is very strong
evidence in bipolar disorder, and there are a number of ways--Have you
talked about how you do genetic studies? Okay. So, you guys know about
twin studies for example and family history studies. So, this is
actually a compilation of a group of studies. And here you've got some
of them – twin studies--compared. So, in monozygotic twins, if your
identical twin has bipolar disorder, you have over a 60% chance of
having the disorder yourself. In contrast, if it's your--if you're just
a fraternal twin of a person with bipolar disorder, you only have about
a 12% chance of having the disorder. So, that massive difference there
is very strong evidence that there's a genetic component to the
transmission of the disorder. Similarly, the more distant you get in
terms of your biological relation to a person with bipolar disorder,
the lower your rate or your risk of the disorder is. So, the second
degree relatives of a person with bipolar disorder only have about 2%
chance of getting the disorder. And that's barely above what's in the
general population, which is about a 1% chance of getting the disorder.
So, it's very clear that bipolar disorder has a genetic component to
it.</p>

<p>With depression alone, major depression, there are probably versions
of the disorder that have a stronger genetic component to them than
others. And in particular, folks who have what's called "early onset
depression," where their first episodes come on in childhood or very
early adolescence, seem to have a form of depression that has a
stronger genetic component to it. Whereas, people who have depression
that is clearly triggered by a major life event like a trauma or a
loss--those types of depression are less clearly linked strongly to
genetic factors.</p>

<p>There are also a number of neurotransmitters that have been
implicated in the mood disorders. And the class of neurotransmitters
that's been researched most often is what's called the monoamines. I'm
sure you've heard about the link between serotonin and depression, but
there are two other monoamines, norepinephrine and dopamine, that have
also been linked to both of the mood disorders, both bipolar disorder
and depression. And it used to be thought that it was just that in
people with depression they didn't have enough of these
neurotransmitters, enough serotonin, in particular, in the system, in
the brain, in order to function normally. But now the theories on what
the role of neurotransmitters is have a lot more to do with the
receptors for these neurotransmitters and their functioning. And the
notion is that the receptors for neurotransmitters like serotonin don't
function efficiently. So, even if there's enough of the chemicals in
the synapses in the brain, the neurons can't make use of them because
the receptors aren't functioning appropriately. And so what the drugs
that help relieve depression do is to improve the functioning of these
neurotransmitters.</p>

<p>There's a very interesting line of work that's going on right now
looking at the intersection of genetic predisposition neurotransmitter
functioning and stress. And we have one of the world's experts on this
kind of work now here at Yale, Julia Kim-Cohen, who just joined us in
the last year. But there are several recent studies. There's another
person in psychiatry, Joan Kaufman, who's done some of this work. But
there are several recent studies that find that certain variations or
polymorphisms on the serotonin transporter gene predict who will become
depressed in the face of stress.</p>

<p>So, a classic study was done by Avshalom Caspi and colleagues, and
they found that people who have one or two of what's called the short
allele on the serotonin transporter gene--so this is a particular
variation on the serotonin transporter gene--if they had one or two of
these short alleles and they were confronted with stress, they were
more likely to develop depression. But it's important to sort of
dissect this. So people who had--it didn't really matter which of these
genes you had. If you were never confronted with major kinds of stress,
like maltreatment, if you weren't confronted with stress, you were no
more likely to have depression regardless of what kind of serotonin
gene you had. But if you had either one short allele or two short
alleles and you were confronted with maltreatment as a child, you had a
much greater probability of becoming depressed at some time in your
life. And this has been replicated with other samples, with other forms
of major trauma. And basically the story is, it takes the intersection
of a genetic predisposition and major stress to create full-blown
depression in some people. Now, that may not be true for all genetic
predispositions or all forms of depression, but this serotonin finding
has actually been replicated now in at least four different studies.
So, it seems to be a pretty reliable effect. So again, genes do not
determine the disorder, but the intersection of genes and stress seems
to be a major risk factor for the disorder.</p>

<p>There are a number of brain areas that seem to be involved in the
mood disorders where there is just dysregulation or dysfunction. The
prefrontal cortex, as you probably have studied, is an area of the
brain that's very involved in higher order complex thinking and problem
solving and in goal-directed behavior. In people with depression,
there's lowered activity in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting
that--which may play a role in the difficulties in concentration, in
goal-directed behavior, in planning and problem solving and in
regulating emotion.</p>

<p>The amygdala is an area of the brain that is involved in the
processing of emotional information. And people with mood disorders
show overactive amygdala responses to emotional information. This is
true in both bipolar and in depression. The hippocampus is an area of
the brain that's very involved in memory and in concentration. And in
people with chronic depression, you often see shrinkage in the
hippocampus, and this may be related to their problems in concentration
and attention. And then finally, the anterior cingulate is an area of
the brain that's involved in a lot of different activities, but
pertinent to the mood disorders, particularly in responses to
distress--to stress and in sort of the choice of behaviors. And it may
be that dysregulation of the anterior cingulate may be involved in the
person's difficulty in responding appropriately to stress, in choosing
good coping behaviors and changing their behaviors whenever their
behaviors aren't working well.</p>

<p>So, from the biological theories come a number of different drugs to
treat the mood disorders. Two of the older classes are called the
monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants. The
tricyclics are still used these days to some extent. They're relatively
effective. About 60% of people respond well to the tricyclics, but they
have a lot of side effects, and they can be fatal in overdose. And so
there was a--has been always a search for other alternatives to them.
The drugs that have really taken over the market are the selective
serotonin re-uptake inhibitors or SSRIs. This is Paxil, Prozac and the
like. They were introduced in 1987--Prozac was--in the U.S. market and
truly took over the market in the treatment of depression and anxiety
and a number of other disorders. Now, they're not that much more
effective than the sort of old style antidepressants, but they have
fewer side effects and they tend to be easier for people to
tolerate.</p>

<p>More recently, there are selective serotonin/norepinephrine
re-uptake inhibitors. These drugs, by the way, what these drugs
supposedly do is to prevent the re-uptake of serotonin or serotonin and
norepinephrine back into the sending neuron. So, it creates more of the
neurotransmitter there in the synapse. And these are reasonably
effective drugs, although, again, there's a substantial number of
people who don't respond to them, especially immediately. And they'll
often have to cycle through a number of drugs before they find one that
works.</p>

<p>Lithium is the drug of choice for the treatment of bipolar disorder.
It seems to stabilize the mood swings by stabilizing the number of
different neurotransmitter systems. But the lithium is problematic
because there are tremendous side effects. It's also dangerous for
women to take while they're pregnant in terms of fetal development. So,
it's a very tough drug to stay on. There are lots of gastrointestinal
side effects and such, and people are often on lithium and the
antidepressants because lithium often only affects the manic episodes
but it doesn't really relieve the depression.</p>

<p>And then finally anti-psychotic medications, that is those help
people who've lost touch with reality, are sometimes used to treat the
mood disorders whenever the person has lost touch with reality.</p>

<p>I'm going to go through and talk about some of the psychosocial
treatments because I want to get to them as well. The cognitive
behavioral therapies are based on Aaron Beck's Negative Cognitive
Theory of Depression. Aaron Beck is a psychiatrist at the University of
Pennsylvania who really founded this whole line of work. And according
to Beck, this--now, this applies to depression alone. It doesn't really
apply to bipolar disorder. People who are depressed have a negative
view of the self, of the future and of the world, and he calls this the
"negative cognitive triad." And this negative cognitive triad is fed by
specific cognitive deficits or biases. So, depressed people show a lot
of distortions in thinking. "All-or-nothing thinking" is thinking that
things are either all good or all bad. They can't sort of see the gray
areas in between. There's "emotional reasoning," and an example of that
is just if I feel like a loser I must be a loser. Of if I feel stupid,
I must be stupid. And then "personalization," that is the self-blame
that you often see in depressed people. And these kinds of distortions
in thinking, these distorted ways of interpreting situations, feed a
kind of general negative view of the self and hopelessness about the
future.</p>

<p>People who are depressed also make attributions for negative events
that are internal, that is, they blame themselves--that are stable.
They see bad things as lasting forever and that are global. They see
bad events as affecting many areas of their life, which, again, feeds
their depression and their general assumption that life is terrible.
And evidence that these--for these cognitive theories, that these
negative cognitive styles predict depression--one of the best studies
predicting this was a study that was jointly done at Temple University
and the University of Wisconsin where they identified first year
college students with a negative cognitive or attributional style. But
these were people who had never experienced an episode of depression
yet. They then tracked them for the next two years, and the bars
here--the red bars are the percent of those with a negative cognitive
style who developed an episode of major depression in that two and a
half years versus the percent of those without a negative cognitive
style. And as you can see, there's quite a substantial difference
between the two. So prospectively, these characteristics seem to
predict your risk for depression.</p>

<p>In turn, there is a cognitive behavioral therapy that's based on
Beck's theory. And the major steps in this involve identifying the
themes in a person's negative thoughts and triggers for them and in
helping the person challenge those thoughts by asking them what the
evidence is for their interpretations, whether there are other ways of
looking at the situation, how they could cope with the situation if a
bad thing really did happen. So, the therapist helps the client
recognize negative beliefs or assumptions and then challenges the truth
value of these, and then change aspects of the environment that are
related to depressive symptoms. So, they challenge your rational
thinking, but they also recognize that there are really bad things that
sometimes are going on the life of a person who is depressed, and they
help them engage in more active problem solving to change those
environments. They also teach the person ways to manage their mood so
that they don't tumble down into depression. And these cognitive
behavioral therapies have been shown to be extremely effective and as
effective in some ways as the drug treatments.</p>

<p>So, this is a recent study in which they had 240 patients with major
depressive disorder. They gave them four months of acute treatment with
either cognitive behavioral therapy or Paxil, which is an SSRI. And in
eight weeks here--they also had a placebo control group where they just
got a pill, but it was a sugar pill. At eight weeks, the Paxil group,
which is in red, and the CBT group, which is in yellow, were relatively
even, although the Paxil group had a little bit of an edge over the CBT
group. But by sixteen weeks the Paxil and CBT group were absolutely
even in terms of the percent of people who were no longer depressed.
So, both of them resulted in about 60% of people not being
depressed.</p>

<p>And then one of the things that's been found over and over again
with cognitive behavioral therapy is that it not only helps people get
out of a current episode of depression, it helps to prevent future
episodes of depression because it teaches the person new coping skills
for dealing with new stressors that arise. So, in this same study they
followed the patients for an additional twelve months. And of the Paxil
group, half were left on full-dose medications to see if you could
prevent depression by just keeping people on the meds, and half of the
Paxil group were withdrawn to a placebo. And let's look at the placebo
group first here.</p>

<p>This is the sad news about depression. If you just take drugs to get
out of a current episode and you go off of the drugs without having any
kind of psychotherapy, your rate of relapse tends to be very high. So,
in this group of 240, almost 80% relapsed in the first year after going
off of the active medication. Again, these were people who did not get
any cognitive behavioral therapy. Of those people who stayed on Paxil
alone, about 50% relapsed. But of those people who got cognitive
behavioral therapy, only about 35% relapsed. And this kind of finding
has been replicated over and over again, namely that CBT can reduce the
rate of relapse in depression quite dramatically.</p>

<p>I want to give you a flavor for what CBT looks like, and I've got a
short clip of a therapist who is actually, interestingly, the daughter
of Aaron Beck and his heir in terms of the practice and development of
cognitive behavioral therapy. And she's demonstrating CBT. This is
actually a role play, but it's a pretty realistic role play, of how she
goes after and helps to challenge a gentleman's negative cognitions
about himself. This is a guy in the role who's recently lost his job
and is really depressed over his job loss. [video clip playing]</p>

<p>Okay. I'm going to stop there because we're running out of time. But
I just want to comment on a couple of things that she's doing. So, you
see that she's having him generate his own challenges to his negative
thoughts and write them down. And the whole--one of the major premises
in CBT is it's not just what goes on in the therapy session that is
effective. In fact, that's a minor part of it, but what the person
practices in the time between therapy sessions. And so, what she's
doing is helping him come up with a series of phrases he can say to
himself when he feels discouraged and plunging down. She's also helping
him do what's called "anticipatory coping," anticipating those
situations that are going to trigger negative feelings and negative
thoughts and coming up with ways of combating them in the moment that
he can enact at the time.</p>

<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy is very structured, it's very focused
and it's designed to be relatively short-term. The one other major kind
of psychotherapy for depression is interpersonal therapy. It's based on
the theory that negative views of the self and expectations about the
self and relationships are based on upbringings that really fostered
these kinds of negative self-views. And so, what you need to do is to
help clients understand their negative self-views and how they're
rooted in their past relationships. Interpersonal therapy is less
structured than cognitive behavioral therapy, and it's more focused on
the past. CBT is very focused on the present and dealing with the
current situation that you're facing and combating that and developing
coping styles for that.</p>

<p>There are a few studies comparing interpersonal therapy with CBT,
but much less research has been done on IPT than CBT. But it is a
positive alternative for some people, particularly those who find that
their depression is very tied-up in recurrent themes in their
relationships that seem to happen over and over and over again.</p>

<p>But to end, the good news about depression is that there are these
alternative therapies. There is a number of drug therapies and there
are at least two psychotherapies that good controlled research has
shown can be very helpful. So, people have a choice, and there is
absolutely no need for people to stay in depression but rather to seek
out the kind of therapy that applies to and appeals to them the most.
Good. Thanks very much.</p>
