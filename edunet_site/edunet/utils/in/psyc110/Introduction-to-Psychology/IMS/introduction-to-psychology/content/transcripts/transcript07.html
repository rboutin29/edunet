<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: Two follow-ups on yesterday's--I'm
sorry, on Monday's lecture. One is that somebody came up after class
and asked when the preference for your own language emerges in
development and fortunately, [A graduate teaching assistant] studies
pretty much exactly this sort of infant understanding. She knew the
answer. There's been studies looking at newborn babies finding that
pretty much the moment they pop out they favor their own language over
other language--over other languages. And this suggests that they are
listening while in utero, while in the womb, to the rhythms of their
language and developing a preference for it.</p>

<p>A second issue is, I talked very briefly about a court case in which
the person was--said at a moment where someone else was pointing a gun
at a police officer, "Let him have it!" and a police officer was
killed. And that person was charged with murder but I admitted I didn't
actually know how things turned out and [a graduate teaching assistant]
was kind enough to do extensive research. Well, he went to Wikipedia
and [laughter] found out the answer. The answer is he was tried and
found guilty for murder. He was then subsequently pardoned. In fact, he
was pardoned in 1988, which is really nice except he was executed in
1957. But they did it into a movie. So, it's a movie.</p>

<p>Okay. So, I want to do today, for the first part of the lecture, is
continue the language lecture and then move to perception, attention,
and memory. And what we had spoken about was--We first talked about
universals of language, then moved to some detail about the different
aspects of language including phonology, morphology, and syntax. We
discussed the ways in which language does the amazing things it does,
including the fact that language has used arbitrary science or sounds
to convey concepts, and that languages exploit a combinatorial system
including recursion to put together these symbols into a virtually
limitless set of meaningful sentences. We then talked about development
and made some remarks about the developmental time course – talking
about the emergence of language from babies to – where babies are
really good at learning language to you who are not, whose brains have
atrophied, whose language capacities are dead.</p>

<p>Final issue is to shift to animals. Now that we know something about
language, we could then ask do animals use--possess the same sort of
language? And if not, can they learn it? Now, there is absolutely no
doubt at all that nonhuman animals possess communication systems. This
has been known forever and is not a matter of controversy. And if you
want to use the term "language" to mean "communication," then the
answer is obviously "yes." Dogs and bees and monkeys have language. If
you want to use language though in the more technical, narrow sense as
anything that has the properties that we discussed earlier, using
English and ASL and Spanish and so on as our background, the answer's
almost certainly "no."</p>

<p>Animal communication systems fall into sort of one of three
categories. Either there is a finite list of calls, so vervet monkeys,
for instance, have a small list of calls to convey different warnings
like "attack from a snake" or "attack from a leopard." There is a
continuous analog signal. So, bee dance, for instance, works on this
way. Bee dance communicates the location of food sources but doesn't do
it in any syntactically structured way. Rather, the intensity of the
dance corresponds to the richness of the food source. And then, you get
things like random variation on a theme such as birdsong. But what you
don't find in any real sense is phonology, morphology, syntax,
combinatorial systems or arbitrary names.</p>

<p>Now, this much is not particularly controversial. There gets to be a
lot of controversy though. This is the summary about nonhuman
communication systems. It gets more controversial when we get to famous
cases of primates trained by humans such as Kanzi, Nim Chimpsky, and
other famous primates that you may well have seen on the Discovery
channel and other venues. And this is fairly controversial. If you read
the Gray textbook, while nothing in it is particularly inaccurate, I
think Gray is actually a little bit too credulous, too believing in the
claims that have been made about the abilities of the animals. So many
scientists argue, for instance, that animals like Kanzi, even if they
can be said to be learning words at all, learn very few of them. And it
takes them extensive years of training to learn, unlike a normally
developing child who could learn a word in a day or a word in an hour.
The utterances often have order but this order tends to be very limited
and lacks the recursive properties. And in fact, the lack of recursion
is not controversial.</p>

<p>Finally, the utterances of chimpanzees--trained chimpanzees are
extremely repetitive so what you often see on TV and in documentaries
is sort of a sampling. And the sampling could often be very impressive
but if you take just what they say at random it tends to look like
this. This is typical chimpanzee utterances just taken at random: "Nim
eat, Nim eat. Drink, eat, me Nim. Me gum, me gum. Tickle me, Nim play.
Me eat, me eat. Me banana, you banana, me you give. Banana me, me eat.
Give orange, me give, eat orange, me eat orange." Lila Gleitman once
commented that if any normally developing child spoke like this, his
parents would rush him screaming to a neurologist.</p>

<p>There's a broader question here, which is, "Why would we ever expect
a chimpanzee to learn a human language?" We don't normally expect one
species to have the capacities associated with another species. So,
bats use echolocation to get around and some birds navigate by the
stars, but there's not an active research program seeing if cats can
use echolocation or dogs could navigate by the stars. And I think one
reason why you might be tempted to think, "well, of course chimps must
be able to learn language" is because you might be caught in the grips
of some bad ideas about language.</p>

<p>So, one idea is you might say, "Look. Chimps should use language
because chimps are so smart." But the response to this is, "they are
smart but we know that smart isn't enough." We know that the human
capacity for language is not totally a result of smartness. There are
smart children who, due to some deficit in their language capacity,
don't speak or understand a language. So, the smartness of chimpanzees
does not in itself demonstrate that they should be able to learn
language.</p>

<p>You might also point out correctly that chimps are our nearest
evolutionary relatives, which is right, so you--one would expect on the
face of it--it's not unreasonable to expect us to share a lot of
abilities with them. On the other hand, we split from them a long time
ago and plainly humans are different from chimps. And there was five
million years either way and that's more than enough time for a
language capacity to evolve.</p>

<p>Now, none of this is to say that the study of nonhuman communication
systems isn't interesting. From my own--This is my personal opinion
I'll raise here. From my own opinion, the study of the attempts to try
to teach chimpanzees, or gibbons, or gorillas, a human language like
ASL are misguided. It would be as if a team of monkeys kidnapped a
human child and tried to train him how to hoot like a monkey. It might
be enjoyable but it does not seem to give us any rich insights. What I
think is a lot more interesting is the study of these animal
communication systems in the wild. There's a linguistics of human
language that has delineated the principles that underlie all human
languages. It would be as extraordinarily interesting to attempt the
same linguistic program to the other communication systems used in the
wild such as the cries of vervet monkeys and bee dance.</p>

<p>So, this brings the section on language to a close but I want to
tell you a few things we didn't talk about. One of the problems with an
Intro Psych course is we have to whip through a lot of topics very
fast. So, if you were to take a course that focused directly on
language you might learn, for instance, more about language in the
brain, something touched about very briefly in the textbook but
something that has a large literature associated with it. Similarly,
and related to this, there's language disorders, disorders like
aphasias and disorders like specific language impairment and dyslexia.
There is the study of language perception and production. How is it
that we do this amazing feat of understanding and producing words in a
fraction of a second? Where does that ability come from?</p>

<p>There is the study of reading which is, in many ways, different from
the study of a language. Remember when Darwin described language as an
instinct. He carefully distinguished it from other things that don't
come natural to us including reading. And in fact, reading is
difficult. Reading is a cultural invention, not every human has it. And
unlike language, reading is acquired with tremendous difficulty over
many years. On the other hand, reading plainly intersects with
language. It's a new way of conveying language, moving out from speech
to writing. And the psychology and neuroscience of reading is thus very
interesting.</p>

<p>There's bilingualism and multilingualism. The questions people in
this room typically are going to be interested in is does it matter for
how well you learn language whether you're learning one or two or three
or four. How is it that a multilingual encodes all these different
languages inside a single brain? And so on. Finally, a very hot issue
is that of the relationship between language and thought and I'm
actually--A few years ago I taught an entire seminar called "Language
and Thought" devoted to precisely this question. And it's a cool
question and it could break up into two very general questions. One is,
"Is language necessary for abstract thought?" And one way to answer
that question is to look at creatures without language like babies and
chimpanzees and see how smart they are. It might be that they're
not--that they're very smart, in which case it would suggest you don't
need language for abstract thought. On the other hand, it might be that
they have certain cognitive limitations, which would suggest that
language is essential for abstract thought.</p>

<p>Then there's the related question. Even once you know a language,
does the structural properties of the language that you know affect the
way you think? And the claim that the language you know affects how you
think is sometimes described as linguistic relativity or the
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. So for instance, there's a lot of research
looking at speakers of different languages such as English versus
Korean and seeing whether structural differences in these languages
affect how you think. Now, some of this work is discussed in the
readings, the book--the Gray textbook, and the selections from <i>The
Norton Anthology.</i> And this makes up--again, I've showed this to you
on Monday--your reading response where you have to address this
question and take your best shot at answering it. What are your
questions about language? Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> The question was raised, "Some people
learn languages easier than others and how do we explain this?" And the
answer is you could ask the question both with regard to first language
learning – so some children learn language very quickly, some are very
slow – and also with regard to second language learning. Some of you
are breezing through your second language requirement here at Yale.
Others are struggling and miserable. And there's considerable
variation. There's the story of Einstein who was very slow to learn
language and didn't speak at all until he was four. And in fact, he was
a--He said his first words when all of a sudden he was having supper
with his parents and he put down the spoon and he said, "The soup is
too hot." And his parents stared in astonishment and said, "You've
never spoken before." And he said, "Well, up to now everything's been
fine." [laughter] It's not a true story. [laughter]</p>

<p>The question of why and where these differences come from, nobody
really knows and it's surprisingly hard. There's a slight advantage for
being female. Girls are slightly more advanced in language than boys
but it's not a big one and you need a hundred people to just see it
statistically. There's a big genetic factor. If your parents learned
language quickly and learned other languages quickly, you are more
likely to. But an understanding of the brain bases of these differences
or the cognitive bases or the social bases is just--is largely an open
question. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What happens when parents [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> This is actually more the norm around
the world than the situation in the United States where kids are
exposed to a single language. What happens is children learn both
languages. Children are very good, as adults are, of distinguishing
different languages on the basis of their sound system and their
rhythms so they don't typically confuse them. And then they just learn
more than one language. And that's actually more the average state of
affairs around the world. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> You said that people who are right-handed learn
languages [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> The question is about the hemispheric
specialization for language. And I don't have actually much more to say
than what I said before, which I agree is deeply unsatisfying. If
you're right-handed, language is probably in the left side of your
brain. How many people here are left-handed? For you we don't know. It
varies. Some of you have it in the left side. Some of you have it in
the right side. For some of you it's kind of diffuse. Now, why is this?
And in fact, why are some people right-handed and others left-handed in
the first place? Those are really good questions. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Yes. I'll--Yes, that's--I'll answer
that question. And unfortunately, it's going to be the last one and
then I'll go to vision. The question is, "Does learning more than one
language cause you to learn them slower than just learning one
language?" And it would stand to reason that it would. There's a finite
amount of mental resources. If I'm just learning English, I use all of
it for English. And if I'm learning English and Spanish I kind of got
to split. And you'd expect them to be each learned slower. It's one of
the surprises of the study of language development that that
common-sense view does not appear to be true. Children learning more
than one language seem to show no deficit relative--in each of their
languages, relative to a child learning just one language. In other
words, if I am just learning English and I'm a kid and you're learning
English and Spanish and you're a kid, you'll reach the milestones in
English the same time I will. Your extra learning of Spanish doesn't
seem to affect you. There doesn't seem to be any detriment for learning
multiple languages.</p>

<p>Another question which comes up is, "Is there any cognitive
deficit?" In other words, some people have argued that learning
multiple languages sometimes harms children in certain ways. This is a
claim that's been made in Quebec, for instance, over the debate over
how children should be taught English and French. It does not appear to
be the case. There appears to be, as far as we know, no down side to
learning many languages when you're young. Does that answer your
question?</p>

<p>I want to move now to the topic that will take us through today and
through the beginning of next week – perception, attention, and memory.
And I'm putting them together instead of treating them as separate
lectures because there's a sense in which they're the same story. You
see a scene. You see this scene and you're looking at it and you're
perceiving it. It's coming through your eyes and you're interpreting it
and you see something. You see a man and you see a house. If you were
to shut your eyes, you could still hold that scene in memory. And a
week later, if I'm to ask you about that, "What season was it?" you
would do pretty well. This is the story I want to talk about – how we
do this.</p>

<p>And in the course of this I want to make a series of claims that go
something like this. For perception, I want to first persuade you the
problem of perception's hard and that successful perception involves
educated and unconscious guesses about the world. For attention, I want
to suggest that we attend to some things and not others and we miss a
surprising amount of what happens in the world. For memory, there are
many types of memory. The key to memory is organization and
understanding. And you can't trust some of your memories.</p>

<p>How many of you remember where you were at 9/11? Many of you are
wrong. And I am never going to persuade you of this because you have
certain memories. And you could tell the story. Everybody could tell
the story where they were when the towers went down. But clever
psychologists on September 12 said, "Let's do a study." And they asked
people, "Where were you yesterday when you heard the news?" And they
told them. And then they went back to them later, a year later, two
years later, and said, "Tell me about what happened September 11." And
they said, "I remember totally where I was. I have a very--" And
then--And often the story was wrong. There is a lot like that which
we're going to talk about. And the biggest moral then--so, I put it
really, in really big print--We are often wrong about our experiences,
both of the present and of right now. So, let's start with
perception.</p>

<p>There is a story--I went to graduate school at MIT and there was a
story there about Marvin Minsky who is the A.I. [artificial
intelligence] guru. He--If you've heard the words--the phrase
"artificial intelligence," that was him. And if you heard the claim
that people are nothing more than machines made of meat--also him.
Well, there's a story where he was doing work on robotics and he was
interested in building a robot that could do all sorts of cool things
that's like a robot. And the story goes the robot had to among--had to
write--had to see the world. It had to be able to pick up things and
recognize people and see chairs and navigate its way and Minsky said,
"That's a tough problem. It's going to take a graduate student a whole
summer to figure it out." And he assigned it to a graduate student for
a summer project.</p>

<p>Visual psychologists, perception psychologists, love that story
because the study of computer vision and robotics vision and the
attempts to make machines that can identify and recognize objects has
been a profound failure. There is, at this point, no machine on earth
that could recognize people and objects and things at the level of a
really dumb one-year-old. And the reason why is that it's a much harder
problem than anybody could have expected. Well, what makes it such a
hard problem?</p>

<p>Well, one reason why you might think it's an easy problem is you
say, "Okay. We have to figure out the problem of how people see. Well,
here's what we do." [pointing to a slide that caricatures the inside of
a person's head as containing a little man, the real "you," sitting in
a control room watching a television monitor that is connected to the
larger-head's eyeballs] You're in--You're over there and here's your
eye. And somehow it has to get to this television monitor and then you
look at it and that'll solve the problem of how you see. So, sometimes
people say, "Hey. I hear the eye flips things upside down. I guess this
guy [the guy in your head] is going to have to get used to looking at
things upside down. That's an interesting problem." No. That's not the
way to look at it because that doesn't answer any questions. That just
pushes the question back. Fine. How does "he" see? We're not answering
anything.</p>

<p>Similarly, although the Terminator's [the cyborg assassin from the
movie "The Terminator"] view of the world may correspond to that
[showing a slide of what vision looks like to the Terminator – a series
of gauges and numbers], that doesn't solve any problem of how he
actually sees. So, he has all these numbers shooting out there. Well,
he has to read the numbers. He has to see this. This [pointing to some
icons at the edge of his slide] is my iTunes. [laughter] That's
inadvertent.</p>

<p>Here's the right way to think about perception. You got the eye,
which is very ugly and bloody, and then around here you have the
retina. And the retina is a bunch of nerve cells. And the nerve cells
fire at--for some stimulus and not others. And from this array of
firings, "firing… not firing… firing… not firing," you have to figure
out what the world is. So, a better view is like this. The firings of
the neurons could be viewed as an array of numbers. You have to figure
out how to get from the numbers to objects and people, and to actions
and events. And that's the problem. It's made particularly a difficult
problem because the retina is a two-dimensional surface and you have to
infer a 3D world from a two-dimensional surface. And this is, from a
mathematical point of view, impossible. And what this means is that
there--For any two-dimensional image there is an indefinite number of
three-dimensional images that correspond to it.</p>

<p>So for instance, suppose you have this on your retina, an array of
light shaped like that [referring to a slide portraying a square and an
irregular polygon that could be a square that is tilted backwards in
space]. What does that correspond to in the world? Well, it could
correspond to a thing just like that that you're looking for or it
could correspond to a square that's tilted backwards. And so, you have
to figure out which is which. And the way we solve this problem is that
we have unconscious assumptions about how the world works. Our minds
contain certain assumptions about how things should be that enable us
to make educated guesses from the two-dimensional array on to the
three-dimensional world.</p>

<p>And I purposefully did not make the slides available for this class
ahead of time because I don't want people to cheat, but there are
several points where you could look at the slides and confirm that some
of the things I'm going to tell you are actually true. And I want to
give you three examples. One is color. And I'm going to conflate here
color and brightness. The other is objects. The other is depth.</p>

<p>First, the problem of color. How do you tell a lump of coal from a
snowball? Well, that's a lump of coal and that's a snowball, and it's
from Google images. How do you know which is which? Well, a lump of
coal you say is black and a snowball is white. How do you know? Well,
maybe you have on your retina--Your retina responds to sort of color
that hits it. It's oversimplified, but let's assume that this is true.
So, this is black coming out and that's white and that's how you tell.
But in fact, that can't be right. It can't be right because objects'
color is not merely a matter of what material they're made of but of
the amount of light that hits it. So, as I walk across the stage I fall
into shadow and light, and none of you screams out, "Professor Bloom is
changing colors!" Rather, you automatically factor out the change in
illumination as this is happening.</p>

<p>And this could actually be quite striking. So, you see this display
over here. Take a look at those two blocks. [a slide portrays two
blocks of different luminance, one under a table, one in the middle of
a lit room.] I take it you see this one [the object under the table] as
lighter than that one. You do. You might imagine this is because this
strip [the block under the table] is lighter than this [the block out
in the open] but it isn't. They're the same. And you won't believe me
until you actually print it out and take a look, but they are in fact
the same. I'll show it to you. And you could say I'm tricking you but
this is the way it works. There's the close-up. So, remember we're
comparing this and this [the two blocks]. Now, let's take away other
parts of the environment and you'll see they're the same. [As Professor
Bloom covers the background surrounding both of the blocks they
suddenly appear to be the same color as one another.]</p>

<p>Now you say, "But hold it. This can't be the same as this" but the
answer is--goes like this. We know shadows make surfaces darker. We
don't know this like "Here's something I know." Rather, we know this in
that it's wired up in our brains. So when we see a surface in shadow we
automatically assume that it's lighter than it looks, and we see it as
lighter. And you could show this by removing the cues to the shadow.
And you see it as it really is. And this is an illustration of how the
information to your eyes is just one bit of information; the degree of
light coming from a single source is one bit of information that you
use to calculate certain assumptions and come to a conclusion.</p>

<p>Here's a different kind of example: Objects. You see this [a picture
of a man walking down a path, in front of his house] and you
automatically and intuitively segment it into different objects. You
segment it into a man and a house and birds and trees. How do you do
this? It turns out, to program a computer to segment a scene into
different objects is hugely difficult and the question of how we do it
is, to some extent, unknown. But one answer to this question is there
are certain cues in the environment that are signals that you're
dealing with different objects. And these cues are often described as
Gestalt principles.</p>

<p>So, one example is "proximity." When you see things that are close
to each other, you're more likely than not to assume that they belong
to the same thing. There's "similarity." That display [a group of many
objects that are all the same shape, but all the objects on one side
have a different texture than those on the other side] could correspond
to an indefinite number of objects but you naturally tend to see it as
two. You do one with one texture pattern, the other with the other
texture pattern. "Closure." The fact that this is a closed square here
suggests it's a single object [referring to a line drawing of a square
overlapping a circle]. "Good continuation." If you had to judge, this
[referring to a picture of two overlapping lines, line AB and line CD]
could just as well be two shapes, one that runs from A to C, the other
one that runs from D to B. But you don't tend to see it that way.
Rather, you tend to see it as one that runs from A to B, the other one
that runs from C to D. "Common movement." If things move together
they're a single object. And "good form." You see the object over there
[two overlapping and perpendicular rectangles]. In the absence of any
other information, you might be tempted to say that's a single thing, a
plus sign maybe. This [pointing to two overlapping but
non-perpendicular rectangles], because it has lousy form, you're more
tempted to say it's two things, one thing lying on top of each
other.</p>

<p>And these are the sort of cues, expectations; none of them are
right. There's cases where they could all fool you. But these are
useful cues that guide our parceling of the world, our segmenting of
the world into distinct objects. Here they are summarized [pointing to
a slide showing all the cues on the same page]. And here's a case where
they fool you [pointing to a slide showing a Kanizsa Triangle, an
illusory triangle induced by three incomplete circles]. So you might
think, if you're suggestible, that there is a triangle here. And this
is a case where there are certain cues driving you to think that
there's a triangle here. There is, however, no triangle here. If you
cover up these little Pacmen here, the triangle goes away. Similarly,
there is no square in the middle [referring to a picture of a Kanizsa
Square]. There is no square. It's very <i>Matrix</i>. And these are
illusions because these are cues that there should be a square there,
the regularity of form.</p>

<p>Finally, "depth." You see this [the picture of the man walking away
from his house] and you don't--You see it on one level as a flat thing.
Another level you look inside the picture and you see, for instance,
the man is in front of the house. You look at me and you see the
podium. And if you have a terrible neurological disorder you see this
strange creature that's half podium leading on to a chest and up to a
head that's sort of--the top of him is wiggling and the podium staying
still. If you are neurologically normal, you see a man walking back and
forth behind a podium. How do you do that? Well, this is really a
problem because, I could give you a technical reason why vision is
hard, but crudely, you got a two-dimensional retina and you have to
figure out a three-dimensional world. How do you do it? And the answer
once again is assumptions or cues. There are certain assumptions the
visual system makes that aren't always right and in fact, in cases of
visual illusions, can be wrong but will guide you to perceive the world
in a correct and accurate way.</p>

<p>So for example, there is binocular disparity. This is actually a
sort of interesting one. This is the only depth cue that involves two
eyes. If I look at you [a student sitting in the front row] pretty
close, the image I get here [pointing to his right eye] and the image I
get here [pointing to his left eye] are somewhat different while--or I
have to focus my eyes together to get the same image. If I look at you
in back, they're almost identical because the further away, given the
two eyes that are static, the closer the images look. And it's not,
again, that you say to yourself, "Oh. Back there an orange. It's the
same image in my right eye and my left eye. You must be far away."
Rather, unconsciously and automatically you make estimations on how far
people are in depth based on binocular disparity.</p>

<p>There is "interposition." How do you know I'm in front of the podium
and the podium's not in front of me? No. How do you know the podium's
in front of me? Well, from where I'm standing it's right. How do you
know the podium is in front of me? Well, because I'm walking here and
then it cuts into me. And unless I'm going through a grotesque
metamorphosis, what's happening is it makes sense to say I'm moving
behind the podium. Interposition. You take the guy. How do you know the
guy is standing in front of the house? Well, because there is--you see
all of him and he's blocking a lot of the house.</p>

<p>There's relative size. How far away am I? Well, if you looked at me
and you had to estimate how far away I am, part of the way you'll
figure that out is you know how tall a human's supposed to be. If you
thought that I was fifty feet tall, you would assume I'm further away
than I am. And so, your judgments on size dictate your judgments about
distance. Usually, this cue isn't necessary but if you look at the
Empire State Building--If you go into a field and you see a tower and
you look, your judgment of how far away the tower's going to be depends
on your knowledge of how tall a tower should be. If it's this tall, you
say, "Oh. It must be--" And then you'd be surprised. There's texture
gradient, which I'll explain in a second, and linear perspective, which
I'll also explain in a second.</p>

<p>Texture gradient goes like this. Remember the problem we had before.
How do you know if that thing [a spotted rectangle that's tilted
backwards] is this object [a spotted rectangle standing upright] or an
object in and of itself? Well, the answer is things with textures will
show themselves because the textures will get smaller from a distance.
Now, logically, this could still be a single thing standing upright
with just dots going up smaller. But the natural assumption is the
reason why the dots recede in this regular fashion is because it's
receding in depth.</p>

<p>Classic illusion – the Mueller-Lyer illusion. People will see this
as longer than this [referring to one of two arrow-like lines, one with
both ends pointing inward, the other with both ends pointing outward].
It's not. If you don't believe me, print it out and measure it. Related
to the Ponzo illusion, once again people see this one [showing a
picture of two gradually converging lines crossed by several horizontal
lines, like a train-track receding in the distance] as--you get
illusions named after you when you discover these--this one [a
horizontal line at the top] as longer than this [a horizontal line at
the bottom]. Again, it's not.</p>

<p>What's going on here? Well, the top line looks longer even though it
isn't. And one explanation for why is, these other lines in the scene
cause your visual system to make guesses about distance. And then you
correct for distance by making assumptions about size. If you have two
lines--You'll get--We'll get in more detail in a second, but if you
have two lines and they take up the same amount of space on your
retina, but you believe that one is 100 feet away and the other's 50
feet away, the one that's 100 feet away you will see as bigger because
your brain will say, "Well, if it takes up just this much space but
it's further away, it must be bigger than something that's closer and
takes up that much space." And that's what goes on here.</p>

<p>For the top line, for the Mueller-Lyer illusion, we assume that this
is further away and this is closer based on the cues to distance. And
the cue is factored in. And because we assume that this is further
away, we assume it must be bigger to take up the same space as this
which is closer. Similarly for the Ponzo illusion. There's linear
perspective. Parallel lines tend to recede in distance. If this top one
is further away than this but they take up the same size in your eye,
this one must be bigger and you see it as bigger. And the book offers
more details on how these illusions work.</p>

<p>I'm going to end with an illusion that I'm not even going to bother
explaining. I'll just show it to you because you should be able to,
based on thinking about these other illusions, figure it out. It was
developed by Roger Shepard. Well, you know that. And they are called
Shepard tables [pointing to a picture of what looks like two simple
dining tables, or desks. One that looks longer and skinnier than the
other]. And the thing about it is, these look like two tables. If you
ask people--You don't frame in terms of here's a lecture on visual
perception. You ask people, "Which of these tables would be easier to
get through a door if you have a thin door?" People would say the one
on the left. This one looks sort of thicker and harder to get through.
This one looks longer and leaner. In fact, they're the same size. What
I mean by that is that this [rectangle] is exactly the same as this
[rectangle].</p>

<p>Now, I'm going to prove it to you by showing you something which
took me--on the computer which took me about seven hours to do. And
nobody's going to believe it because I could have faked it. But if you
want, print it out and do it yourself. You just take a piece of paper,
put it on here. Then you move it [he demonstrates that a piece of
paper, cut to be the same size as one of the tables, fits perfectly
over the other table] and [they're] the same. I showed it to somebody
and they called me a liar. Anyway, you could do it yourself in the
privacy of your own home or study. But what I'd really like you to do
after you do it is say, "Okay. Fine. Why does this one look longer and
thinner than this one?" And the answer is the same answer that will
explain the Mueller-Lyer illusion and the Ponzo illusion, having to do
with cues to depth and the way your mind corrects the perception of
depth. And that's all I have to say at this point about perception.</p>

<p>I want to move now to attention and memory and I'm going to treat
attention and memory together. We are fascinated with memory and, in
particular, it's particularly interesting when memory goes wrong. It's
particularly fascinating what happens in cases of amnesia. So for
example, I need a volunteer who is willing to do a little bit of
acting, a very little bit, an incredibly little bit. [a student
volunteers] Excellent. Okay. So well, you just stay there. So pretend
you have amnesia. Okay? What's your name?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Perfect. I'm really glad you said that.
That's the wrong answer because you don't have total amnesia. You still
remember English. Okay. It's very clever. Okay. So you couldn't have
lost all your memories. You have English. You [pointing to a different
student]--So we'll do you. What's your name? Oh. He looks puzzled but
he still maintains bowel and bladder control so he hasn't forgotten
everything. [laughter] Now, I always lose the third volunteer in that
demo.</p>

<p>So, what I'm saying is that memory is a hugely broad concept. It
includes autobiographical memory, which is what we standardly think.
That's a perfectly rational response. When I say somebody's losing
their memory, "Oh. I have a movie about somebody losing their memory,"
you don't imagine a person in diapers. You imagine the person walking
around, having sex with cool people and saying, "Where am I?" And
[laughter] so what you imagine is you imagine them losing their
autobiographical memory, their sense of self. But of course, knowing
English is part of your memory and knowing how to stand and knowing how
to chew and swallow are all things that you've learned, that
you've--that have been molded by experience.</p>

<p>There's another distinction which is going to come in regarding
amnesia, which is there's broadly two types of amnesia. They often run
together, but one type of amnesia is you lose your memory of the past.
Another type of amnesia--That's the Matt Damon amnesia. Another type of
amnesia though is you lose the ability to form new memories. And here's
a film of a man who had exactly this problem. [film playing]</p>

<p>He was a world-renowned choir director and he suffered viral
encephalitis which led to brain damage which destroyed most of his
temporal lobes, his hippocampus, and a lot of his left frontal lobe. It
could be--It could have been worse in that he retains the ability to
talk. He seems to be--He's not intellectually impaired. He just can't
form new memories and so he lives in this perpetual "now" where just
nothing affects him and he feels--This has not always happened. There's
more than one of these cases and it doesn't always happen like this,
but he feels continually reborn at every moment. And we'll return to
this and then ask what's going on here. But there's a few themes
here.</p>

<p>I want to, before getting into detail about memory, I want to review
some basic distinctions in memory when we talk about memory. So
crudely, you could make a distinction between sensory memory,
short-term memory, which is also known as working memory, and long-term
memory. Sensory memory is a residue in your senses. There's a flash of
lightning. You might see an afterimage. That afterimage is your sensory
memory. There's somewhat of a longer echoic memory for sounds. So as
somebody is talking to you even if you're not paying attention you'll
store a few seconds of what they're saying, which is sometimes, when
somebody's talking to you and you're not listening to them and they
say, "You're not listening to me." And you say, "No. You were talking
about--" and pick up the last couple of seconds from echoic memory.
There's short-term memory.</p>

<p>Anybody remember what I just said? If you did, that's short-term
memory--spans for a few minutes. And then there's long-term memory.
Anybody know who Elvis is? Do you know your name? Do you know where you
live? Your long-term memory store that you walk around with and you're
not going to lose right away. When we think about amnesia in the movie
sense, we think of a certain loss of long-term memory associated with
autobiographical personal events.</p>

<p>There is a distinction between implicit and explicit, which we'll
talk about it in more detail. But explicit, crudely, is what you have
conscious access to. So, what you had for dinner last night. You could
think back and say, "I had this for dinner last night." Implicit is
more unconscious. What the word--what certain word--what the word "had"
means, how to walk, how to ride a bicycle, that you might not be able
to articulate and might not even be conscious of but still have access
to.</p>

<p>There's a distinction between semantic memory and episodic memory.
Semantic memory is basically facts, what a word means, what's the
capital of Canada, and so on. Episodic is autobiography, is what
happened to you. That Yale is in New Haven is semantic. That you went
on vacation away from New Haven last week, it would be episodic. There
is encoding stores and retrieval, which refers to different levels of
what happens in memory. Encoding is getting the memory in, as when you
study for a test or you have an experience. And storage is holding the
memory. And retrieval is getting the memory out.</p>

<p>Finally, retrieval is often broken, conveniently, into recall versus
recognition, where recall is when you just pull it out of memory and
recognition is when you recognize what corresponds to something in the
past. Anybody remember what color tie I had on two days ago? Oh. Okay.
Well, that would be impossible to remember but if I asked you, "Is it
purple or is it orange?" that would be much easier. [laughter] Now, you
could break up, crudely, the memory into stages. So you start that
sensory memory is just the stuff that comes in leading to short-term
memory, leading to long-term memory. And this stage theory is something
which we'll discuss in more detail. But this leads us to the issue of
attention.</p>

<p>How do you get memory from your sensations, from what you're
hearing? I'm speaking to you. You're hearing me. How does it ever get
in to the other systems? What decides what's remembered and what's not?
There's all sorts of things happening to you now. The seat of your
chair is pressing against your butt. You wouldn't say, "Oh. I want to
remember this forever. The seat's pressing against my butt." [laughter]
Your neighbor is exuding a certain sort of smell. You're thinking about
something. Your eyes follow him. Not everything gets in memory. You'd
go mad if you tried to remember everything. You can't. So, what
determines what gets into memory? Well, one answer is "attention
does."</p>

<p>And attention is--could be crudely viewed as a flashlight, a
spotlight on experience that willingly zooms in on something and makes
it memorable. Attention has certain properties. Some things come from
attention--to attention effortlessly and automatically. Here's an
example. You're going to see an array of letters here. One of them's
going to be green. When you see the green one, please clap. [laughter]
No, not this green one. [laughter] There's going to be another slide.
Okay. You're ready now. [students quickly find the one green "x"
amongst a background of black "x"s. Okay. Now find--Not that "o"
[laughter] but there's going to be an "o." When you see it clap.
[students quickly find the "o" amongst a background of "x"s] Okay.
Sometimes it's work. Find the red "o." [students are much slower at
finding the red "o" amongst a background of black "o"s and red "x"s]
[laughter] It's harder.</p>

<p>Sometimes attention is involuntary. I need a volunteer. And all I
want to do is I want to show you colors on the screen and I'd like you
to name the colors as they come out. [pointing at a student] Do you
want this?</p>

<p><b>Student 1:</b> I'm colorblind.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Oh. [laughter] The first one is easy.
See. This is--You have to just go down the colors [on the slide are a
series of different colored rectangles. The student must name the
colors]. Anybody? Okay.</p>

<p><b>Student 2:</b> Red, green, blue, black, green, blue, red, blue,
black, red.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Excellent. [applause] Okay. Now these.
These will be words but just name--Okay, you. Just name the colors.
[this slide contains color words that are written in the same color
that they spell. Again, the student must name the color of the
font]</p>

<p><b>Student 3:</b> Green, red, blue, black, blue, red, green, black,
red, blue.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Perfect. Now, we'll go back to you,
same deal, words. [now the slide contains a list of color words that
are written in a different colored font then what they spell. The
student must name the font color.]</p>

<p><b>Student 4:</b> Red, blue, green --</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> No, no, no. Huh uh. Don't--I know you
can read. The colors.</p>

<p><b>Student 4:</b> Okay. Sorry. Okay. Blue, green, red, green, black,
green, blue, black, red, [laughter] blue, black, red, black. [the
student struggles to name the color of the font without accidentally
saying the name that is written]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Very good actually. [laughter] That's
known as the Stroop effect. Being an expert reader, as you are, your
knowledge of reading, your attention to what the words meant, subverted
your desire to do the task. You couldn't make that go away even if you
wanted to. If somebody gave you $1,000 to read this as fast as you read
this, and as fast as you read this, you'd be unable to. You can't block
it.</p>

<p>There is some work--There are some interesting discoveries about
attention. I have a demonstration here. I'd like people actually--It's
important--Some of you may have seen this before. It's important for
you to be silent throughout it. What you're going to see is you're
going to see two teams of basketball players. One of them is going to
have white T-shirts. The other one will have black T-shirts. They'll be
passing balls back and forth. What I'd like you to do is count in your
head how many passes the white team does with the ball. [the video
shows several people passing a basketball back and forth while, at one
point, a person in a gorilla suit walks across the scene] [laughter]
What number did people get? Okay. Did anybody notice anything unusual?
[laughter] Did anybody not notice anything unusual? Okay. Some people
did not notice anything unusual. Those who didn't see anything unusual,
watch this again and just watch it. [laughter] About 50% of people when
counting, who have never seen this before don't notice anything. But
then when you're not counting it's kind of obvious what you're missing.
[laughter] And this is one demonstration among many of the fact that
when you're attending to something you have a very small window of
attention and you lose the focus on other things.</p>

<p>Here's another different example. I'd like people to watch a movie
and pay attention very closely to what happens in the movie and try to
remember this. [The movie shows a conversation between two people. Each
time the camera cuts from one angle to the next something about the
scene changes.] How many of you noticed something odd in that movie?
How many of you didn't? Okay. Now, everybody look at the scarf, the
color of the plates and the food, among other things. [the same movie
plays again] The phenomena, in general, has been called "change
blindness." And what it is is we tend to be--when there's a focus of
attention focused in a certain way, we tend to be oblivious to other
things that go on in the environment. Often it is, in fact, quite
difficult when there's a change in scene to notice what changes and
what stays the same.</p>

<p>So, in this final demo, there's just going to be two pictures
flicking. Could you clap when you see what's different between the two
pictures? [applause] [laughter] I myself am terrible at these and so I
have a lot of sympathy. How many people never saw it? [laughter] Good.
That's very impressive. [laughter] One more time with a different one.
[applause] Did anybody not see it? Be honest. I'll give you another
try. [applause] Okay. I'll put you out of your misery. [laughter] This
is work by Dan Simons and it's part of an extraordinarily interesting
body of work on what's known as "change blindness." And what this means
is, the phenomena is, we have a very narrow focus of attention and huge
changes can happen that we are oblivious to. This is why, in movies,
there are so many--so much difficulty with continuity changes.</p>

<p>Dan Simons is also famous for having brought this outside of the
laboratory in some classic experiments and I'm trying to get the film
corresponding to them. What he did was that he did this great study in
the Cornell campus where he was--where what happened is they would get
some unsuspecting person walking through campus and some guy would come
over and say, "Excuse me, Sir. I'm lost. Could you help me with
directions?" And have a map and then the person would say, "Sure." And
then there'd be two construction workers holding a door. And these guys
were going to rudely bump between these two characters and then the
experimenter gets switched with another guy. So now, when these two
guys walk away, the subject is standing there with an entirely
different person. [laughter] What's interesting is nobody notices.
[laughter] They notice if the person changes sexes. "Didn't you used to
be a woman?" [laughter] And they notice if the experimenter changes
races, but most other changes they're oblivious to.</p>

<p>There's another experiment. I think Brian Scholl did this one but it
may have been Dan Simons where what happens is a subject comes in to
the lab. They say, "If you're going to do an experiment with us, you
need to sign the human subject form." Hands him the form, the
experimenter. The subject signs the form. The experimenter takes the
form and says, "Thank you. I'll put it down here." Goes down here and
then a different person pops up. [laughter] People don't notice. And
there's a certain level on which we're oblivious to changes. What's
weird is we don't see--we don't think we are. We think we see the world
as it is and we don't know--notice that when we're attending to
something; everything else gets blanked out.</p>

<p>And so about 50% of people who have never seen this demo before, the
gorilla demo, they don't notice the gorilla. And there's--you couldn't
imagine anything more obvious. The gorilla study was actually done a
very long time ago. And it was originally done in a different way but
I'll show it to you just because this is the original study and now
that you all know what to expect--Oh, not that one. Oops. [demo
playing] Nope. [demo playing] That's actually--If you looked at that
quickly, it's a current Yale professor. Oh. I'm never going to get my
DVD back. Anyway, I'll show you the other demo on--next week. I will.
[laughter] Any questions about attention and memory at this point?
Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Yeah. Why does it work that way? Why is
it--Why do things that become very practiced become automatic and
involuntary? It's a good question. I don't know. We know that they do.
We know that once you--that you can't not read once you know how to
read. You also can't not listen. If I'm talking to you and I'm
extremely boring, but I'm talking to you, it's very hard not to listen.
You can't shut off your ears. You could put your fingers in them but
you can't shut off your--You also can't shut your eyes without actually
shutting them. You can't say, "This is a disgusting movie. I'm not
going to attend to it." [laughter] So, that's not answering your
question. It's just saying that your observation is a right one and a
more general one. When you're good at something and you're
over-practiced, it becomes involuntary and you cannot stop it. Okay.
Well--Oh. One more in back. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> What now? Sorry. Over there. Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible] right before his accident?</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Did he remember things before his
accident? Yes. He had some amnesia of events before his accident but he
did remember things. He knew his name and he knew other things about
his life. Okay. I'll see you next week.</p>
