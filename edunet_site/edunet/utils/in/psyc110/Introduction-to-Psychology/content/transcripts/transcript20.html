<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: Welcome to the last class. Before
starting the lecture I just want to do some final procedural issues.
Again, your reading responses have been completed. Your essays have
been all completed and the grades will be available sometime next week.
The teaching fellows are currently grading them like crazy. Your
experimental participation requirement is up until May 7<sup>th</sup>.
Please finish it by then. If not--just please finish it by then. Your
exam's on Monday. Last class--somebody asked me whether I was going to
post an old exam and I said, "Well, you don't need it because you--I
already posted a midterm and it looks like the Midterm," and one of the
teaching fellows e-mailed me and essentially said, "Why are you so damn
lazy?" [laughter] So, I posted the old final.</p>

<p>Some of you require special accommodations for the Final. The
arrangements will be precisely the same as for the Midterm and Judy
York should be contacting you to set up the arrangements. If there are
any problems with that, definitely contact me as soon as possible but
you should be hearing from Judy York concerning special
arrangements.</p>

<p>Finally, the review sessions are going to be held tomorrow and on
Friday. Please note: It turns out the original class schedule for the
Thursday review session is booked. The review session will be held in
this room from 6 o'clock to 8 o'clock and once again, the teaching
fellows have graciously agreed to run these review sessions.</p>

<p>Okay. This lecture will be a some slightly shorter lecture than
usual. What I first want to do is finish off the discussion of clinical
psychology from last lecture and then have a little brief discussion
about some very interesting research on happiness. We talked--we ended
last lecture with a discussion of some early--some of the history of
treating mental illness and we saw that it was rather gruesome,
unsuccessful, and arbitrary. For the most part, we do better now, and
Dr. Nolen-Hoeksema reviewed some of the therapies with focus on
therapies for depression. The textbook talks in detail about therapies
for different disorders including schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and
so on. The question which everyone is interested in is, "Does therapy
work?" And this proves to be surprisingly difficult to tell. Part of
the problem is if you ask people who go into therapy, "Did you get
better after therapy?" for the most part they'll tell you that they did
but the problem is this could be a statistical byproduct of what's
called "regression to the mean."</p>

<p>So, the idea looks like this. This line plots how you feel from
great through okay to awful and it goes up and down and in fact in
everyday life you're going to--some days are going to be average, some
days will be better than average, some days worse than average. You
could plot your semester. You could do a plot every morning when you
wake up or every night before you go to bed. You could put yourself on
a graph and it'll come out to some sort of wiggly thing. Statistically,
if something is above average or below average it's going to trend
towards average just because that's a statistical inevitability. When
do people go to therapy? Well, they go to therapy when they're feeling
really crappy. They go to therapy when they're feeling unusually bad.
Even if therapy then has no effect at all, if it's true that people's
moods tend to go up and down after you feel really bad you'll probably
improve rather than get worse. And so this could happen--the normal
flow could happen just even if therapy has no effect at all.</p>

<p>And so, simply getting better after therapy doesn't tell you
anything. On the worst day of your life you could do naked jumping
jacks on the roof of your college for ten minutes. I guarantee you your
next day would probably be better. That doesn't mean naked jumping
jacks are helping you. Rather, it just means that the day after the
worst day of your life usually is not as bad as the worst day of your
life. It can get worse, but usually it just trends to average. What
you've got to do then is you have to take people at the same point who
would get treatment and compare them to people who do not get treatment
or what we call a "control group." And this is an example of this. So,
this is for people who are depressed. This is statistically equal. They
start off pre-therapy. They all go for therapy but because in this
example there's a limited number of therapists, some of them are put on
a waiting list and others get a therapist. It's arbitrary. It's random,
which is--which--making it a very good experiment. And in this example,
you could see those who received cognitive training were better off.
They had lower depression scores than those that received no therapy at
all.</p>

<p>In general, in fact, we could make some general conclusions about
therapy. Therapy by and large works. People in treatment do better than
those who are not in treatment and that's not merely because they
choose to go into treatment. Rather, it's people who are in desperate
straits who seek out help. Those who get help are likely to be better
off than those that don't get help. Therapy for the most part works. We
can't cure a lot of things but we can often make them better.</p>

<p>Different sorts of therapy works best for different problems, and
again, depression proves to be an illustrative example. If you have
everyday unipolar depression, that is, you feel very sad and you show
other symptoms associated with depression, an excellent treatment for
you is some combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and possibly
antidepressant medications like SSRIs. If you have bipolar depression,
the cognitive behavioral therapy is useless but medication is your best
bet and so on for all of the other disorders. Each disorder has some
sort of optimal mode of treatment. If you suffer from an anxiety
disorder, cognitive behavioral therapy can be of help. If you're a
schizophrenic it's probably not going to be of much help at all. And
so, different disorders go best with different sorts of therapies.
Finally, some therapists do better than others. So, for reasons that
nobody fully understands, there are good therapists and then there are
better therapists and there are bad therapists. And there's great
individual differences in the efficacy of an individual therapist.</p>

<p>Finally, putting aside then the difference in therapies and the
difference in therapists, does it make sense to say that therapy, in
general, works? And the answer is "yes." And this is in large part
because of what clinical psychologists describe as "nonspecific
factors." And what this just is a term meaning properties that all
therapies, or virtually all therapies, share and I've listed two of
them here.</p>

<p>One of them is "support." No matter what sort of therapy you're
getting involved in, be it a psychoanalyst or a behavior therapist or a
cognitive therapist or a psychiatrist who prescribes you medication or
someone who makes you go through different exercises or keeps a
journal, you have some sense of support, some acceptance, empathy,
encouragement, guidance. You have a human touch. You have somebody who
for at least some of the day really cares about you and wants you to be
better and that could make a huge difference.</p>

<p>Also you have hope. Typically, there's an enthusiasm behind therapy.
There's a sense that this might really make me get better and that hope
could be powerful. Sometimes this is viewed under the rubric of a
placebo effect, which is that maybe the benefits you get from therapy
aren't due to anything in particular the therapist does to you but
rather to the belief that things are going to get better, something is
being done that will help you. And this belief can be a self-fulfilling
prophecy. "Placebo effect" is often used sort of in a dismissive way,
"Oh, it's just a placebo," but placebos can be powerful and even if
it's useless from a real point--from a psychological theory point of
view, even if the therapist runs around and dances while you – I have
dancing on my mind now – while you sit in the chair and watch him
dance; if you believe the dancing is going to make you better, it may
well help. Okay. That's all I'm going to say about therapy. Any
questions about therapy? Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Fair enough. The question is the
assumption of regression to the mean seems sort of arbitrary because it
depends what the mean is. Always after the fact you can apply an
average to it and say, "Look. This is the average," but how do you know
beforehand? It's a good point. When you talk about regression to the
mean, it adopts certain assumptions. The assumption is there really is
an average throughout much of your life and things go up and down
within that average and for the most part that's true for things like
mood. For most of us, we have an average mood and we have bad days and
we have good days. It's always possible that you have a bad day and
then from there on in it's just going to go down and down and down but
statistically the best bet is if you have a bad day you're going to go
back up to the mean. It's--in some way you don't even have to see it
from a clinical point of view. You could map it out yourself. Map out
your moods and the days where you're most depressed sooner or later
you're likely to go up. Similarly, on the happiest day of your life
odds are the next day you're going to go down and there's nothing
magical about this. This is just because under the assumption that
there really is an average in--built into one--each of us. If human
behavior was arbitrary, it would be like a random walk but it's not. We
seem to have sort of set points and aspects of us that we fall back to
that make the idea of a mean a psychologically plausible claim.
Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> That's a good question. Yes. In that
study it's a perfectly good hypothesis that the sort of anxiety of
being told, "I see you've come here for help. We can't give it to you.
Congratulations. You're a control group" [laughs] causes anxiety. In
other studies the control group doesn't know they are the control
group. So sometimes you can do an intervention where you say,
"Congratulations, everybody in Intro Psych who did very low on the
depression inventory," which many of you filled out, "We're going to do
something to you." And then the rest of the people don't even know that
they haven't been chosen. So, you're right. It's a perfectly good
point. Knowing you're not chosen could have a deleterious effect and
the way to respond to that is you have other studies that don't use
that same method.</p>

<p>Okay. I want to end with happiness and it's a strange thing to talk
about in psychology. Most of psychology focuses on human misery, most
of clinical psychology. There is the psychology we spoke about through
most of the semester on vision and language and social behavior, but
typically when people think about interventions what they think about
is people having problems and then we figure out how to make them
better. They are schizophrenic, they are depressed or anxious, they are
just not making it in life, and psychologists try to figure out how to
make things improve. And in fact, a lot of the information I gave you
at the beginning of the lecture last class where I reviewed all of the
disorders is in this wonderful book called <i>DSM-IV, The Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.</i> If you ever really want
to get--If you really [laughs] want to diagnose people and come to have
a belief in your own mental instability, browsing through that book is
a treat. Everything that can go wrong in mental life from Aspergers
syndrome to fetishes to paranoid schizophrenia is all in that wonderful
book and--but a lot of psychologists have been disturbed by the focus
of our field on taking bad people, people who are broken, people who
are sad, and bringing them up to normal. And they've started to ask can
psychology give us any insight into human flourishing, how to take
people who are--who--how to study people who are psychological
successes, how to take people who are psychologically okay and make
them better. And this is the movement known as "positive psychology."
And it has its own handbook now, <i>The Handbook of Positive
Psychology,</i> listing psychological strengths, listing virtues,
ways--what psychology tells us about how we can be at our best.</p>

<p>Some of this work in positive psychology is, in my mind, real crap.
A lot of it is some combination of new age banalities by people who are
striving to get more grant funds and end up on <i>Time</i> magazine. On
the other hand--and so, some of it is really bad. You could imagine
this attracts every self-help huckster you could imagine. On the other
hand, a lot of this work is quite neat, quite interesting and quite
promising. And what I want to do is tell you what I think is the most
interesting research from this movement concerning happiness.</p>

<p>Now, there are a lot of good books on this and I'm going to
recommend books, which I haven't been doing much in this class. Marty
Seligman is the pioneer of positive psychology and he's written an
excellent book called <i>Authentic Happiness.</i> Jonathan Haidt is a
brilliant young scholar who's done--also done a lot of work on disgust
and morality. He did the "sex with dead chicken study" we discussed
earlier. This is one of my favorite books by – <i>Happiness</i> by
Nettle, because it's smart, it's beautifully written and it's extremely
short. And Dan Gilbert's book, <i>Stumbling on Happiness,</i> is a
very, very funny book and very smart book and is now on <i>The New York
Times</i> bestseller list. So, there's no shortage of books on
happiness.</p>

<p>So, the starting point is--And a lot of research on happiness starts
with a basic question: How happy are you? And we're psychologists so
tell us on a scale of one to ten where five is average, ten is
super-duper. The most common answers, interestingly enough, are high.
They're seven or eight. How many people in this room would give
themselves a seven or an eight? Okay. How many a nine or a ten? All
right. How many a ten? Good, good, maxed out on happiness. It turns out
that most people think that they're pretty happy. There's a Lake
Wobegon effect with happiness. Most people think they're very happy. In
fact, most people think they're happier than most people, which
shouldn't really happen.</p>

<p>This question, "How happy are you from one to ten?" has been asked
all over the world. So--and it turns out there are slight differences
depending on how old you are. There are slight differences depending on
your place within a country, California versus New York. There are
slight, subtle differences between men and women at different points,
somewhat paradoxically. Although women are more vulnerable to
depression than men, still on average women are slightly happier than
men. The country-by-country data is quite interesting. In one study
they looked at forty-two countries. The happiest--well, let me see. The
happiest people on earth--well, first, no country believed they were
unhappy, the people in no country of these forty-two countries. I mean,
you're thinking there are some really bad countries to live in and I
don't know if they were tested but of these forty-two everybody
seemed--said they were above average. The happiest people on earth? The
Swiss. [laughter] They think--they're just like--they're just so happy.
I was talking to people about this last night and they suggested
chocolate. [laughter] The saddest people on this--on the sample? The
sad Bulgarians. [laughter] You are wondering what about Americans.
Americans are actually pretty happy, 7.71. We are a happy country full
of happy people.</p>

<p>Now, I'm going to talk about a lot of research that's based on the
data you get when you ask people how happy they are from a scale of one
to ten. But I'm going to be honest and tell you there are reasons to be
cautious about these numbers. And the reasons come from a couple of
experiments. In one experiment they asked people inside a psychology
department where there was a photocopy machine. They went up to
people--the people were going up to the photocopy machine to make
copies and when they were done making copies they asked them, "How
happy are you with your entire life?" There were two groups. Group A,
they put a dime on top of the photocopy machine so people walked over
there, "I'm going to [inaudible]. Oh, a dime. Well." The other group,
no dime. It turned out that when asked "How good is your whole life?"
[laughter] group A reported [laughter] greater life satisfaction
overall in their entire lives.</p>

<p>Another study asked people how happy you are with your whole life on
sunny days like today and people said they were happier on sunny days
than rainy days. What's interesting is you could make this effect go
away if you ask immediately before "How's the weather?" These were done
by phone interviews. And logically, what seems to go on is that if
you're asked how's the weather, you're "Oh, it's really sunny outside,"
and then when people are asked "How happy are you with your whole
life?" people then say, "Oh, okay. I'm going to take into account the
sunny-ness when I give my answer.</p>

<p>Okay. So, what is happiness? What are people rating when they're
answering these sort of questions? And this is an extraordinarily
difficult question and one could devote a seminar to discussing it, but
one simple answer from an evolutionary point of view is that
happiness--forget about "what is happiness?" Ask "what's happiness
for?" just like we've asked what language is for, or what laughter is
for, or what hunger or lust is for. What's happiness for? And one
answer is happiness is a goal state that we've evolved to pursue. It's
a signal that our needs have been satisfied. Happiness is the carrot
we're running towards that makes us take care of our lives. We want to
be happy. An example of this is food. You're not very happy if you're
starving. You want to be satiated, you want to be satisfied, so you
seek out food to fill your belly. Once you've done it, you're
happy.</p>

<p>Steven Pinker summarizes the keys to happiness in a nicely evocative
passage: "We are happier when we are healthy, well-fed, comfortable,
safe, prosperous, knowledgeable, respected, non-celibate, in love." How
many people here have got all of those right now? Oh, come on.
[laughter] Some people. Oddly enough, the person who said he was a ten
didn't--does not raise his hand. Okay. [laughter] So this is- And this
makes out--you get all your needs satisfied, your belly is full, people
love you, you're getting sex regularly, you're smart, you're rich,
you're happy, but as Pinker points out it's not that simple.</p>

<p>Here's the problem. You, Americans in this century, you are now
healthier, better fed and so on than just about anyone in history but
you're not happier. That's the puzzle. In particular, these studies
asking about happiness have been around for a long time. People in the
1950s did not make as much money, did not eat as well, did not live as
long, suffered from more diseases, were more vulnerable in a hundred
different ways, yet they were--are as happy as you are now. You are as
happy as your parents were and they were as happy as your grandparents.
Moreover, in poor countries people don't have the shelter, the
knowledge, the protection, the safety, yet, for the most part, there's
not a huge effect on how rich a country is and--on how happy the people
are.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are great individual differences in happiness
among people whose basic needs are met. For the most part, everybody in
this room is fed and sheltered and safe. Some of you are prosperous,
some of you are knowledgeable, a couple non-celibate, and-- [laughter]
but even among that group you vary in your happiness, and that's kind
of a puzzle. And to explain the puzzle we need to talk about a few
surprising facts about happiness and I'll present three of them.</p>

<p>The first is happiness doesn't change as much as you think. In
particular, happiness is not as sensitive to what happens--your
happiness is not as sensitive to what happens in your environment as
you might think it is. Part of the reason for this is that there
appears to be a strong heritable basis for happiness. So, just as we
talked about the domains of personality and intelligence, there is some
genetic determination, not entirely but some, in how happy you are. And
some people talk in terms of a genetically determined set point. So,
you have a sort of natural happiness level, maybe a range. To put it in
extreme form, some people are genetically predisposed to be pretty
sour, others to be pretty cheerful. Well, that can't be it. Identical
twins are very similar in their happiness but, as with everything else
we've discussed, they're not identical. What about life events?
Wouldn't life events change your happiness? And here we're entering one
of the great discoveries of happiness research.</p>

<p>Think for a moment. What's the worst thing that could happen to you?
And then ask how much would it change your happiness. Now, think for a
moment. What's the best thing that could happen to you? And ask how
much would it change your happiness. And the research in happiness
suggests that your gut feelings are probably wrong. And here's a couple
of case studies.</p>

<p>For many people a very bad thing that could happen to you is to be
paralyzed from the neck down in an accident. It turns out obviously,
common sense, that when this happens it makes people very unhappy. It
makes them depressed, they think their life is over, they feel terribly
sad, but not for that long. After about a year after being paralyzed
from the neck down, people's happiness comes back up pretty much to
where it was before, suggesting that there's a temporary effect but not
a permanent one. Many people believe that winning many, many millions
of dollars in the lottery will make you happier and it does. When you
open up that winning ticket and you say, "I won one hundred million
dollars," you say, "Woo, hoo!" You are honest to God very happy. You'd
say, "Hell, I'm a 10.5, I am very happy." A year later you are not as
happy. In fact, lottery winning may be a terrible case where
people--where it goes the reverse of what you expect. What happens when
you win a lot of money is it often wrenches you away from your family,
your work and your friends and leads you to depression and sadness but
even mundane events that would make you happy--that you think would
make you happy don't seem to last.</p>

<p>In some research by Dan Gilbert and others, they've asked young
assistant professors who are coming up for tenure, and tenure in a
university system is a good thing to get because it gives you lifetime
job security, "How happy would you feel if you got tenure? How happy
would you feel if you didn't get tenure?" Prior to the last election,
they asked people "How happy would you be if it was President Bush? How
happy would you be if it was President Kerry?" And it turns out people
radically overestimated the effects of these things. Having your
favorite candidate win is not such a big deal. Having your favorite
candidate lose is not such a big deal either. Getting tenure or not
getting tenure are really big when it happens. Six months later and a
year later your happiness doesn't seem to be affected.</p>

<p>The purchase of consumer goods, an Xbox 360, a nice flat screen TV,
those sorts of things make you very happy when you open up the package
and set it up but this happiness fades almost immediately. The moral
of--A lot of people are shaking their heads. It's true, not for me
but--the moral of a lot of this work is we think these things will have
big permanent and profound effects but they need not and they often
don't.</p>

<p>Why not? Why do we overestimate their happiness? And the technical
term for this, by the way, is "affective forecasting." Again, this is
Dan Gilbert's work and the idea is we are bad at affective forecasting.
That is, we are bad at predicting how happy or sad we will be in the
future based on what's happening to us. Why? Well, a couple of reasons.
One thing is there's often a failure to appreciate the day-to-day
irrelevance of certain events. So prior to the election--the election's
happening tomorrow and I ask somebody who's a diehard Democrat, "How
would you feel if Bush won?" and the person said, "I'll be miserable.
It'll be a miserable four years afterwards." But what often isn't
appreciated here is that whether or not Bush wins will make you sad or
happy after it happens but for the most of your day-to-day life you
aren't thinking about who the president is. I'd be very happy if I won
a huge prize and I'd be "Whoa, a huge prize," the Nobel prize, a
Guggenheim, a MacArthur ‘Genius' or I get them all in the same day.
[laughter] "What a day. I am really happy." But then a month later I'm
there and I've still got my regular insomnia and there's nothing on TV
and the plumber's not coming and my kids don't respect me and I
can't--and the fact that "Yeah, but I won the prize," it doesn't
matter. A lot of the things in life that'll make you really--that you
think will make you really happy don't have this day-to-day effect.</p>

<p>Also, there is the logic of the set point. And this comes to a
terrible word: We adapt. Right now I'm a guy without a Nobel prize. I'm
kind of used to it. If I got a Nobel prize I'd be a guy with a Nobel
prize. I'd be happy but then I'd kind of get used to that too. And if I
got a second one, "whoa, two!" but then I'd just get used to that too.
You get used to things. You get used to bad things.</p>

<p>Now, I don't want to overstate this. There are some very interesting
exceptions. So for instance, we don't get used to noise. A lot of
research suggests that if your environment is noisy, they're doing
construction around you, you can't get used to it. Your happiness drops
and it doesn't come back up. Your system cannot habituate to continued
noise. We adapt to good things, winning the lottery, winning a prize,
getting an "A " in a course. We adapt, we get used to it, also with
some surprising exceptions. One of the big--one of the other surprises
from happiness research is the effects of cosmetic surgery like breast
enhancement and breast reduction. One of the big surprises is it makes
people happier and then they stay happier. And one explanation for this
is how we look is very important. It's very important for how other
people see us and how we see ourselves, and you never get used to
looking in a certain way. So, if you look better it just makes you
happier all the time.</p>

<p>So, there are these exceptions but putting aside the exceptions, the
problem of adaptation is sometimes called "the hedonic treadmill" and
the idea is hedonic for happy. You keep on running but no matter how
fast you run you stay where you are, you get used to it. Habituation is
like you put--you step into a very hot bath but you get used to it. If
it's a cold bath you get used to it. A difficult environment, an easy
environment, you get used to it. The story is often illustrated--It's
often illustrated with a story from the Bible in Ecclesiastes of a king
and this king had it all. He had gardens, parks, vineyards, castles,
slaves and concubines and they were both male and female concubines.
[laughter] So, he had everything, right, but it didn't make him happy
and here's what he says: "I hated life. All this vanity and a chasing
after wind and there is nothing to be gained under the sun."</p>

<p>Now, in these books I talked about at the beginning these authors
give advice on how to deal with the hedonic treadmill. How do you deal
with the fact that everything you aspire to, once you get it you'll be
used to it and it will lose its value? Well, one answer is that
possessions are not the key to happiness. Possessions you very quickly
get used to. From there, there are two alternatives. One is endless
novelty. So one guy – I forget his name – wrote a book and he says,
"Look. There's the hedonic treadmill. The trick is always do something
different. Next week have sex with somebody you've never had sex
before. Then climb Mount Everest. You get bored with that, become an
accountant. Boring. Scuba diving. Boring." He had endless ideas, and
that's a possibility. You never--you--if you keep changing what you're
doing you'll never get used to anything and you'll always be happy. At
least he says that. Then there's the old guy alternative. Step off the
treadmill. Give up--give up chasing the whole happiness thing and then
seek out more substantial goods that might actually not make you happy
in the simple sense of a quick fix of delight, but substantial goods
like friends and family and long-term projects.</p>

<p>So, the first moral of the science of happiness is that your
happiness is actually rather fixed. It's fixed in part genetically and
it's fixed in part because what happens in your life you'll get used
to, to a large extent. Are you raising your hand? No. Oh, sorry. The
second one is happiness is relative. So, there's a lot of research on
money, power and happiness, and remember I did say before that it
doesn't matter whether you come from a rich country or a poor country.
As long as your country--as long as you're not starving to death, it
kind of doesn't matter how rich your country is for how happy you are.
But that's not the same as saying it doesn't matter how much money you
make. In fact, there's a set point or a range but there is some effect
on your salary and on your job on your happiness. And if you're
desperately poor, no matter where you are, no matter who's around you,
you're not going to be happy. But beyond that your happiness depends on
your relative circumstance. And this is an old insight. H.L. Mencken
wrote, "A wealthy man is one who earns a hundred dollars more than his
wife's sister's husband." The idea is what matters isn't how much you
make. What matters is how much you make relative to the people around
you.</p>

<p>And they've asked people this. "What would you rather? Do you want
to make seventy thousand dollars if everybody else in your office is
making sixty-five thousand or seventy-five thousand dollars if
everybody else is making eighty thousand?" Does it matter how much
money you bring home or does it matter how much money you make relative
to other people? Well, they're both factors but relative salary--and in
this example people prefer this. [pointing to the relative choice] They
prefer to be making less if they're making more than the people around
them. It turns out that there's research on British social servants and
their happiness and their health and the quality of their relationships
and how they love their lives doesn't depend on how much money they
make. It depends on where they are relative to everybody else.</p>

<p>We are very status conscious primates and your role in a hierarchy,
your level in the hierarchy plays a--has a significant effect on your
level of happiness. This is not really a secret. The opera star Maria
Callas and the English professor Stanley Fish had the same negotiating
strategy. When Fish got hired into his department, according to urban
legend at least, he said, "I don't want to talk salary. I don't have a
particular number in mind. I just want to get paid one hundred dollars
more than whoever is the top person in this department." And that's a
guy who knows about happiness. He walks in and he states, "I'm paid
more than everybody else. I don't care how much it is. It's just more."
[laughter] And that's relevant to happiness.</p>

<p>We're now in a position to give some advice to the king, summing up.
First, going back again to Dr. Nolen-Hoeksema's lecture, I think the
king is suffering from mild unipolar depression so we should--he should
get some SSRIs and cognitive behavior therapy. I think he needs to move
his castle to a quiet part of the kingdom. The noise of a busy castle
is stressful. And he needs to give up on the concubines. He needs to
find a queen. He needs to develop social relationships, join a club,
get involved in charity, maybe a hobby. The final finding is a bit of a
jump to a different topic but--sorry. You raised--yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> The question is, "Would you become used
to changes of social interaction?" An example is solitary confinement
or prison. People get used to a lot of things. It could be that in
those examples there is a shift in status as well and social
relationships and how you think of yourself relative to others so that
may be difficult to recover from. If you're popular at Yale and you go
to prison you're not going to be very happy your first few days in
prison probably. But then suppose you get popular in prison, people
like you, you're the head of the book club and everything. [laughter]
You'd rather not be in prison--been in prison but you'll probably be a
pretty--if you're a cheerful guy here you'll be a cheerful guy in
prison.</p>

<p>The final case is--involves judgments of the pleasure and pain of
past events. And I mentioned the Nobel prize a little while ago as an
example but the work I'm going to talk about is actually from the one
psychologist who's alive who's won the Nobel prize--sorry, one of the
ones who's won the Nobel prize, Daniel Kahneman. And he became
interested in happiness. And you remember him from his rationality
research and this is some work on happiness. Here's an example. Anybody
see the movie <em>Marathon Man</em>? It involves a dental torture
scene. Imagine you're going to the dentist and he's torturing you or
it's a cleaning but it's really painful and it's terrible. You're
sweaty, you're squeezing the thing, and it lasts for an hour and then
when it's done the dentist leans over and says, "We're done now. If you
want we could stop. But if you want, as a favor to you – I have five
minutes – I could top you off with some mild pain." This may seem like
a very odd thing to ask. Here's the alternative. What do you want? A
dental procedure that's very painful for an hour or a dental procedure
that's very painful for an hour--sorry about the "S" there [referring
to a slide typo] --and then some additional mild pain? Who votes for A?
You got to choose one. Who votes for A? Okay. Who votes for B?
Okay.</p>

<p>Here's the big finding. The big finding is "yes," B involves more
pain. It's true. "A" is an hour of pain. "B" is an hour of pain plus a
few minutes of more pain. Seems like a no-brainer but when you have A
or B and you have to remember it later on you'll have a much nicer
memory of B than A. Kahneman's insight is when you think back on events
you don't just add up the amount of pleasure or pain you experienced.
Rather, your memory is highly skewed to peaks and then to endings. And
you could imagine this. In the first case, "A," you leave and say, "Oh,
God, that was terrible. Oh." "B," you leave and say, "Oh, that was
mildly painful. There was something terrible in the middle there but it
ended okay, mild pain." It turns out, in general, endings matter a
lot.</p>

<p>Kahneman did his research with – both in a laboratory where you
could make – give people mild pain by getting them to stick their hand
in freezing cold water and with people undergoing extremely painful
colonoscopy procedures. And it turns out that if you want to give
people a good memory, or a less bad memory, of a horrible event topping
them off with some mild pain will do the trick. In the end, endings
matter. Both of these examples, a party that's hugely fun for ninety
percent, then the last ten percent somebody slaps you in the face and
pours dip on you or something-- [laughter] So, ninety percent of good
stuff, ten percent bad stuff, versus ninety percent people are slapping
you and pouring dip on you [laughter] but then ten percent, whoa, that
was a really good--when you think back on it, if you just added it up,
"A" would be much better but "B" has this huge pull because of the
power of how things end so endings matter.</p>

<p>So, I'm going to end things now. I'm first going to do a few things.
Before saying anything more, I want to thank the teaching fellows.
There's Sunny Bang, Erik Cheries, Jane Erickson, Izzat Jarudi, Greg
Laun, and Koleen McCrink. I think they did a superb job. [applause]
We've basically reviewed all the psychology. Here is a promissory note
we started with at the beginning of this semester. I think you are now
in a position to answer or at least consider answers about these
topics, about topics such as dreams, testimony, disgust, memory,
depression, language, humor, and even a little bit about good and evil.
This is an--a broad intro survey class, and the field of psychology is
broad and we've just gotten started. If you're interested, this is a
great department. There are some amazing scholars here and some amazing
teachers and there are courses that go into detail about just about
every topic I talked about. If you're interested in memory or social
interaction or mental illness, I could point you to some great courses.
I'm not taking any sophomore advisees next year because I'm on leave in
the fall but you should feel free to come talk to me if you want any
specific advice or suggestions.</p>

<p>Now, I know not all of you are going to end up majoring in
psychology. Some of you will choose cognitive science instead
[laughter] but on a more serious note I know for some of you this is
the last--maybe the first but the last psychology class you'll ever
take. And so I want to close this course by emphasizing two themes. The
first one is a bit of humility. There are some very basic questions
about the mind – and I've tried to be honest about this throughout the
course--There are some very basic questions about the mind that nobody
knows the answer to yet. We know the brain is the source of mental life
but we don't have any understanding at all about exactly how this
happens, about how a physical object, a lump of meat, can give rise to
conscious experience.</p>

<p>We know that about half of the variants in personality, about half
the differences between people, are due to genetic factors but we don't
know how to explain where the other half happens. It has to be
experienced but we have no real good theories of the sort of experience
that makes one person adventurous and another one timid, one bitter and
one satisfied. We know a lot about the social influences that can drive
people to do terrible things to one another but we don't know the
answer to the maybe harder question of why some of us--some people are
immune to these influences, why some people do good things, perhaps
even heroic things, regardless of the circumstances that they find
themselves in. So, there's an enormous amount left to do. It's an
exciting field just because there's just so much more we need to
understand.</p>

<p>The second theme is more optimistic. And this is the idea that we're
going to eventually come to answer these questions and many more
questions through the sorts of methods we've been discussing this
semester, through constructing scientific theories,
evolution--evolutionary, neurological, developmental, computational and
testing them through experimental and observational methods. This is
the idea that, in the end, the most important and intimate aspects of
ourselves, our beliefs and emotions, our capacities to make decisions,
even our sense of right and wrong can be explained through constructing
and testing scientific hypotheses. Now, the reason why I'm optimistic
is I think there's been some success stories where we really have
learned some surprising and important things about the mind and there's
no reason to expect this way of proceeding to fail us in the
future.</p>

<p>In my very--in the very first class on the brain I ended by talking
about people's worries here, and I'll be honest, that some people find
it a scary prospect. Some people believe that a scientific approach to
the mind takes the "special-ness" away from people, that it diminishes
us somehow. And I don't agree. If there's anything I've tried to
persuade you through the course, it's that the more you look at the
mind and how it works from a serious scientific point of view the more
you come to appreciate its complexities, uniqueness, and its beauty.
This has been a great course to teach. Thank you for coming and good
luck on the Final. [applause]</p>
