<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: Sex is really strange. You ask people,
"What's your favorite activity?" and if you ask people, particularly
college students, particularly just fresh from spring break – I've seen
teen movies – they'll often answer, "Sex." or some word that is
synonymous with sex. But there's a kind of a puzzle about how much time
we spend on sex. And it turns out there is data on this. So, people say
sex is their favorite activity, but it turns out we actually know how
much time the average American spends on sex. And the data I'm going to
follow from was summarized in this wonderful book by James Gleick:</p>

<blockquote>Americans tell pollsters their single favorite activity is
sex. In terms of enjoyability, they rank sex ahead of sports, fishing,
bar-hopping, hugging and kissing, talking with the family, eating,
watching television, going on trips, planning trips, gardening,
bathing, shopping, dressing, housework, dishwashing, laundry, visiting
the dentist, and getting the car repaired. On the other hand, these
same studies suggested the average time per day devoted to sex is four
minutes and three seconds. [As Gleick says,] This is not much, even if
the four minutes excludes time spent flirting, dancing, ogling,
cruising the boulevard, toning up in gyms, toning up in beauty parlors,
rehearsing pick up lines, showering, thinking about sex, reading about
sex, doodling pornographically, looking at erotic magazines, renting
videos, dreaming of sex, looking at fashion magazines, cleaning up
after sex, coping with the consequences of sex, building towers or
otherwise repressing, transferring, and sublimating .</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And I like this passage because it illustrates two points, two
important points. One is we don't actually spend that much time on sex.
In fact, the four minutes and three seconds is an interesting number
because when you do times studies on how much Americans spend filling
out tax-related forms for the IRS, it's four minutes and a few seconds.
But the passage also points out that regardless of the brute time we
spend on it, it is extraordinarily important. Everything in life
follows from it – marriage, family, children, much of aggression, much
of competition, much of art and music and creative pursuits. Much of
everything follows from it. If we were a creature without sex,
everything would be different.</p>

<p>And what's interesting is, there are creatures without sex. There
are creatures that reproduce by cloning. And in fact, this basic fact
about people – that we fall, roughly, into males and females – is an
evolutionary mystery. It's not clear why animals that are somewhat
large have two sexes. From a biological Darwinian perspective, having
two sexes is bizarre because each time you have an offspring you toss
away half your genes. My children only have--each of them have half my
DNA. If I were to clone, they would have all of it. And so, it's a
puzzle how sex ever evolved.</p>

<p>This is not a course in evolutionary biology, and that's not the
puzzle we're going to be looking at today. We're going to look at a few
questions. First, we're going to talk from first a theoretical point of
view and then an empirical point of view about how males and females
are different. Then we're going to talk about sexual attractiveness,
some research about what people find to be sexually attractive, and
then we'll talk a very little bit at the end about the origins of
sexual preference: why some people are straight, others gay, others
bisexual, and others harder to classify.</p>

<p>Now, of all the topics I'm presenting, sex is one of the sort of
dicey ones from an emotional point of view. These are difficult issues
because sex is, by definition, an intimate part of our lives, and it
matters a lot. Moreover, sex is fraught with moral implications. And
since I'm talking about this from, at least at the beginning, from a
Darwinian evolutionary perspective, I'm obliged to start off by dealing
with some of the moral consequences and moral implications.</p>

<p>So, for instance, many biologists – all biologists I would say –
will have argued that sexual behavior, sexual action, sexual desire is,
to some extent, a biological adaptation existing to spread our genes.
From that perspective then, non-procreative sex – including gay sex,
sex with birth control, sex by post-menopausal women – does not serve
this reproductive goal and, in some sense perhaps, is unnatural. And
one might argue then, "Does this mean it's wrong?" We'll also be
talking about sex differences, differences between men and women, for
instance, in how much you want anonymous sexual encounters, differences
between men and women in social intelligence, in aggression and
empathy. And regardless of what you think about these differences,
whether you think they're right or wrong or it doesn't matter, you'll
ask the question, "To what extent are they mutable?" That is, if they
exist through Darwinian natural selection, to what extent can we ever
get rid of them? And I want to address those two issues, the issues of
morality and inevitability, from the very start. And I want to start
off with--for each of them have a quote by a prominent evolutionary
scholar. So, the first one is by Steve Pinker in <i>How the Mind
Works</i>. And he writes,</p>

<blockquote>Nature does not dictate what we should accept or how we
should live our lives. Well into my procreating years, I am so far
voluntarily childless, having squandered my biological resources
reading and writing, doing research, helping friends and students, and
jogging in circles--ignoring the solemn imperative to spread my genes.
By Darwinian standards, I am a horrible mistake, a pathetic loser, but
I am happy to be that way, and if my genes don't like it they can go
jump in the lake.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Pinker's point, I think, is a reasonable one. It is true that
certain things we do exist to serve the dictates of natural selection,
but that doesn't make them right? If you think that something is only
right if it leads to the generation of more genes, if it leads to
reproduction, then you're not going to think very much about birth
control. You're not going to think very much about any sort of
non-procreative sex. On the other hand, if you're--Moreover, if you
think something's wrong if it's unnatural, you're going to think much
about flying in a plane or refrigerating food or surviving a severe
infection. More generally, our bodies and brains have evolved for
reproductive success, but we can use these brains to choose our own
destinies. Nothing moral necessarily follows from the facts of biology.
That's all I'm going to say about morality. But I want you to keep it
in mind when we discuss different claims about what's evolved and what
hasn't.</p>

<p>What about inevitability? Here I want to turn to Richard Dawkins.
Richard Dawkins writes,</p>

<blockquote>If a child has had bad teaching in mathematics, it is
accepted that a resulting deficiency can be remedied by extra-good
teaching in the following year. But any suggestion that the child's
deficiency might have a genetic origin is likely to be greeted with
something approaching despair. If it's in the genes, it is determined
and nothing can be done about it. This is pernicious nonsense on an
almost astrological scale. Genetic causes and environmental causes are
in principle no different from each other. Some may be harder to
reverse, others may be easy. What did genes do to deserve their
sinister, juggernaut-like reputation? Why are genes thought to be so
much more fixed and inescapable in their effects than television, nuns
or books.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>I like the nuns. And the point here is what causes something is
logically separate from what can reverse it. And you can think of clear
cases where something is plainly genetic but is fairly easily reversed
and where something is cultural and is very difficult to reverse.
Here's an example. My eyesight is quite poor. The reason why my
eyesight is quite poor is not due to the patriarchy, television,
culture or "the man." Rather, my eyesight is quite poor due to the
crappy genes Mom and Dad gave me. It is genetically determined if
anything is. It is also fairly easy to fix. There are these machines
where they put panes of glass in front of your eyes and help you to see
better. More advanced machines known as contact lenses actually stick
the thing into your eyes, and at the cost of occasional infections you
come to see better. It's biologically caused but fairly easy to
fix.</p>

<p>On the other hand, take an example of society's treatment of the
obese. It turns out when we – and we'll get to this a little bit when
we talk about sexual attractiveness – how thin somebody is or how fat
they are; what you think of that is actually not particularly
hard-wired. It varies a lot from culture to culture. But once it's in a
culture, it is almost impossible to shake. So, the point, there is just
that genetic does not mean inevitable, and cultural does not mean easy
to fix.</p>

<p>Okay. That's general background. Let's start with basic Sex Ed.
What's the difference between males and females? Well, don't even think
penis and vagina. There are a lot of animals that have neither one. And
the difference actually runs deeper. By definition, when biologists
talk about this, animals that are males have a little sex cell, which
carries genes and nothing else – sperm cells. Animals that are females
have a big sex cell, which has genes but also food and a protective
cover and all sorts of other stuff. Typically, the little sex cell is
much littler than the big sex cell. This is the only erotic picture I'm
going to show you today. It's a bunch of these little sperm circling
around the egg. It's romantic.</p>

<p>But this raises a puzzle. I just described male and female roughly
in terms of a size difference. Males are the smaller of the sex cells;
females are the bigger. Why is it then that for so many animals males
are the bigger ones, physically, and the more aggressive ones. This has
been a puzzle that has occupied scientists for a long, long time. And
we're pretty--there is now a pretty clear answer to it. And the answer
goes like this. It is based on an idea by Robert Trivers called
"parental investment." And what parental investment is, it's defined
here as, any investment that's going to increase the offspring's chance
of survival at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other
offspring.</p>

<p>So, for example, suppose an animal could create an offspring by
blinking an eye and then the offspring would run off? That would be
extremely little investment. Suppose another animal had to work for ten
years, and during those ten years could not create another offspring.
That would be a huge investment. Trivers points out that within a
species, females typically have a much higher parental investment than
males. Because females have these big sex cells, they typically
incubate them internally. They carry them. If they're eggs, they might
have to sit on them. And hence, each potential child is a huge
cost.</p>

<p>For males, which have the small sex cell, you don't have the same
thing. For males, it might just be a few moments of copulation and
that's it. If you could ask yourself, for humans, each one of you in
the room, "What is the minimum effort you can do to create a child that
has half your genes?" And it's apparent that the male investment, on
average, is lower than the female investment. Males can choose, or
might do better off in some circumstances by putting a lot of
investment into their offspring, but females don't have a choice.
Females, barring technological advance, have a huge investment into any
offspring; not investment in the sense or hard work and effort, though
there's that too. Investment in the sense that when you're--when you're
pregnant with one offspring, you can't have another.</p>

<p>What this does is it has ramifications that percolate upwards. So,
it leads to different psychologies. Males--and a single male could
fertilize several females, forcing some males to go mate-less and
giving rise to competition to see who can mate with the most females.
For females, however, females can always find mates. So, sheer numbers
don't count. But there's competition to mate with the right males,
those whose offspring have the best chance of surviving. The
competition now explains the puzzle we started with. It explains why
males are typically larger, and often why males have evolved special
weapons. These special weapons evolved for fighting other males for
reproductive access. It also explains something else. Females,
biologically, are choosy. And so males have to compete not merely with
other males to get reproductive access but also to woo females. And so
often, males have evolved special displays like this [showing a picture
of a peacock's plumage], which exist only to be beautiful, only to be
attractive and to attract mates.</p>

<p>This cold evolutionary logic was captured in this cartoon, which
really does sum up a hundred of mate-selection research. The logic goes
like this then: difference in the size of sex cells leads to
differences in typical parental investment, leading to differences in
the sorts of psychological and physiological mechanisms that evolved.
Okay, that's a good story. What sort of evidence is there for it? Well,
it turns out this could explain some otherwise surprising things. For
instance, there should be--there are some cases where the parental
investment is switched, some cases where it turns out--where the males
end up with more investment than the females. And it--and the theory
predicts that in these cases you should get an asymmetry.</p>

<p>So, in cases like pipefish, for instance, the male takes the eggs
into a pouch and plugs them into his bloodstream. The females shoot
off. They have less of an investment than the males. In this case, you
would predict, as is true, the females should be larger, the females
fight other females more than males fight males, and the females try to
compete for the attention of the males. Recall the movie "March of the
Penguins." We saw a clip from it, and this was in the context of
discussing the emotions that have evolved toward our offspring. But
remember the story and how both the male and the female have to go to
tremendous lengths to protect the egg. And if one of them fails, the
egg dies and neither one has it. You should then not even have to
remember whether male penguins are much bigger than female penguins.
You should realize they should not be, and in fact they aren't. They're
about the same size because the parental is equal.</p>

<p>You should be able to predict the size differences and aggression
differences based on differing parental investment. So for instance,
elephant seals are four times--the males are enormous. They're four
times bigger than the females. And this is in large part because
elephant seals compete for harems of females. It's a "winner take all."
Gibbons are about the same size. And this is because gibbons are pretty
monogamous; they raise children together.</p>

<p>This illustrates something, which is, it's not always the case that
male parental investment is low. There are some species, including
gibbons, where it's in the male's reproductive advantage to care for
the offspring. Imagine a situation, for instance, where an offspring
would die if both parents didn't watch it for many years and where the
effort devoted to that offspring had to be exclusive. If you focused on
another family or went away, the offspring would die. In that case,
you'd have equal investment. It would matter equally to the male and
the female to invest in their offspring, and the cost would be the
same. There's no species--it's hard to see species that have that much
of an equal system, but some primates are close to it. And this raises
the question then, "What about humans?" What about us? What do we know
about the differences between males and females?</p>

<p>Well, humans are a relatively polygamous species. Most
cultures--most human cultures are polygamous. American culture is what
they call "serial monogamy." So, we're not like some species of birds.
We don't mate for life. We do a series of peer-bondings for some period
of time. It could be for life, but indeed may not be and usually isn't.
Males are bigger than females. Human males--the size estimates vary so
much, but the average human male is about fifteen percent larger than
the average human female. This suggests that there's some--there's
been, in our evolutionary history, some male-male competition for
access to females, which suggests, in turn, that the parental
investment is not quite equal. Males have smaller testicles for their
body size than chimpanzees, but larger testicles than gorillas and
gibbons. And this suggests that there was some intermediate amount of
competition for the capacity to create sperm. And this is relevant for
a different sort of competition, which regards the impregnation of
females that have multiple mates. And this suggests that over
evolutionary history women were not wantonly promiscuous, but were not
entirely monogamous either; so much so that it paid from an
evolutionary point of view to evolve--males to evolve the capacity to
produce more sperm than other males.</p>

<p>Aggression. Males are meaner. I mean I'm summarizing here. Meaner is
not a technical term. Yes, females can be meaner, but males are at
least more physically violent. They're more violent in the womb, in
utero; they're more violent as children, and they're more violent as
adults. Again, this is not to say that you can't find violent women or
non-violent men. It's just on average there is this difference. They
kick more; males kick more in the uterus. As children they're more
involved in play fighting and violent combat-like sports. And as
adults, wherever you go you will find a prison. And wherever you go you
will find that prison is mostly full of men. They are far more likely
to kill one another and to harm one another. Male sex hormones, like
testosterone, are not the sort of thing one would want to inject in
somebody unless you want them to turn kind of mean. They increase
aggressiveness, both in humans and in other primates.</p>

<p>What about sexual choosiness? Do male humans and female humans
differ in the extent to which they will favor anonymous sex? And this
is relevant from an evolutionary perspective, because the parental
investment theory predicts males should be more receptive to anonymous
sex. Because for males, to impregnate somebody else might fortuitously
lead to another offspring; it might be good for you and doesn't carry
the sort of harm that females, on the other hand, have to be very
picky. Because they have to choose carefully. Remember, these systems
evolved before birth control and vasectomies and so on. So, what do we
know cross-culturally and psychologically?</p>

<p>Well, prostitution is a universally, or near universally, male
interest. There are male prostitutes, of course, but contrary to some
various fantasies and sitcoms, they cater to male customers.
Pornography is a human universal. In every society, males have done
some sort of depictions of naked females for the purposes of arousal.
Often they carve them into trees or do sort of sculptures. One of the
weirdest findings in the last decade or so is that this extends as well
to monkey porn. And so, some scientists at Duke set up a situation
where monkeys could pay in fruit juice, by giving up fruit juice, to
look a picture either of the female's hindquarters or of a celebrity
monkey, a socially dominant monkey, some sort of combination of
<i>People Magazine</i> and <i>Penthouse</i>. And so, there's some
interest in this even by non-human primates.</p>

<p>What about actually preference for sexual variety? Well, you can get
at this in different ways. There is what biologists describe as the
"Coolidge Effect." I have this here [on a slide]. And the Coolidge
Effect is based on President Calvin Coolidge. And it's a story about
Calvin Coolidge and his wife, who were being shown around a farm
separately. And the person showing around his wife pointed out that
there were a lot of hens; she noticed that there were a lot of hens but
only one rooster. And she asked the guy showing her around, "Is one
rooster enough?" And the guys said, "Well, you know, the rooster works
very hard. The rooster has sex dozens of times a day." And she said,
"Well, be sure to tell that to the president." The story goes, the
president went around, the guy tells the story to the president. The
president asks the man, "Huh. Has sex dozens of times each day. Same
hen every time?" The guy says, "No, different hen every time." And he
says, "Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge."</p>

<p>Now, there are two responses to this sort of story, and they're both
kind of negative. One thing is, "Well, everybody knows males prefer
anonymous sex with strange women. Duh." The other response is, "That's
sexist claptrap." You might think--you might be a male and say, "That's
not me." You might know males and say, "The males I know are not like
that." So, how do you find out? Well, there are indirect measures, such
who goes to prostitutes. But there are also fairly direct measures. One
fairly direct measure is you could ask people in anonymous surveys. So,
in fact, I'll give you some anonymous surveys. I'm not going to ask
people. And you just ask them. So, for instance, I want everybody to
consider this question. How many sexual partners do you want to have in
the next month? What is it--we're coming up to April. How many sexual
partners do you want in April? Next two years? Take many of you through
graduation. When you leave Yale, what do you want--like, "I had X
sexual partners, and that's what I wanted." Or your lifetime? We get
people to answer these questions.</p>

<p>Professor Chun last year in this course had clickers, and he got
people to do it. We are not so high tech, so we'll just do it in our
heads. But here is the way the answers come out. Women say less than
one in the next month. That doesn't mean they want less than one; that
means many of them--many of them say zero, some say one and so on.
One--four to five. Men--two, eight, eighteen. You can ask other
questions from this population. So, you could ask, "Would you have sex
with a desirable partner you have known--so somebody really
desirable--for a year; women say yes, six months--unsure, week or
less--no. Men [slide reads "yes, yes, yes"] [laughter]--and with men
you could get a majority going to five minutes.</p>

<p>This is all Q &amp; A, pen and pencil sort of things. Some brave
scientists have actually done experiments. And in one experiment
somebody--I don't, you know, this is the sort of thing which you
probably wouldn't do nowadays. This work has been done ten years ago,
where they have an incredibly attractive man and an incredibly
attractive woman and they approach people on campus. They're not from
campus; they're actors brought in. And they go to people, to strangers,
and they say, "I've been noticing you around campus. I find you very
attractive. Would you go out with me tonight? Would you come over to my
apartment tonight? Would you go to bed with me tonight?" The experiment
you wouldn't think anybody would've done has been done, and women
about--a very attractive man, over half of the women approached say,
"Yeah, I will. [go out with you tonight]" Very few agree to this
["Would you come to my apartment tonight?"], and nobody agrees to this
["Would you go to bed with me tonight?"]. For men, the data are like
this, they go up to there and then up to there [they say yes 50%, 69%
and 75% of the time respectively]. In this study, the twenty five
percent of males who said "no" apologized profusely, and they said,
"Oh, you know, my fiancé's in town, and [unintelligible]."</p>

<p>What about behavior? Well, you--if we're interested in sex
differences, you can't actually figure out what people want, male
female differences, by looking at simply at the average number of times
people have sex because if males and females have different priorities,
then heterosexual sex is a compromise between two groups of people with
competing interests. What's a more clear reflection then is gay sex
between two women or between two men, because then you get a pure
reflection of sexual desire. Now, the data here tend to be very messy.
Again, they're survey studies but by and large every study done tends
to find a difference in the expected direction, which is that females
tend to be--lesbians tend to be much more monogamous than gay men. Some
studies prior to AIDS – this was many years ago – found gay men to be
extremely promiscuous, often having over a hundred or over a thousand
partners. You wouldn't find this sort of promiscuity in females. And a
way to think about this is, what these gay men are doing is exactly
what your average heterosexual man would do if he had that degree of
willing females who were as willing as he was. And this all suggests
that there's some sort of difference along lines expected in sexual
choosiness in humans.</p>

<p>What about sexual attractiveness? What about mate preference? What
do we find attractive? Well, unlike the choosiness studies, here we
actually have some pretty good cross-cultural data. So one study, for
instance, was done in 10,000 people from thirty-seven countries, asking
people, "Who do you want to be with?" And there are different studies,
some of them asking, "Who do you want to marry?" Other studies, "Who do
you want as a mate? Who do you want as a sexual partner?" And one main
finding is kind of reassuring, everybody likes kindness and
intelligence, or at least everybody says they like kindness and
intelligence. These are valued pretty highly.</p>

<p>But at the same time, there are sex differences. Females focus more
on power and status and more on interest in investing in children. And
think about that from an evolutionary point of view and it makes sense.
It doesn't matter hugely, from the standpoint of reproduction, how old
the man is. The difference between fifteen and twenty-five and
thirty-five and forty-five may matter a lot for his status in the
community, his physical strength, his lifespan but from the standpoint
of his sperm it doesn't matter hugely. Later on there's a drop off and
it does begin to matter, but it doesn't matter hugely. What does matter
is his interest in being a good father, in protecting you from
predation, from murder, from assault by other people, and in taking
care of the kid. Women's brains are wired up to find males with those
properties.</p>

<p>Similarly, males focus a little bit differently. They're more
interested in all of these things, but also on the ability to have
children. So, from an evolutionary point of view, there's actually a
very big difference between a twenty-year old and a fifty-year old,
from a male standpoint looking at a female, because the one can have
offspring and the other cannot. So, this is a difference.</p>

<p>But what I want to focus more on right now is back to another
similarity. Everybody likes beauty. And I want to devote a little bit
of this lecture to talking about physical beauty. Physical beauty, as
these beautiful people say, is a curse. So she--she's like a big model,
a supermodel, maybe even a super-supermodel--points out the
arbitrariness of finding her devastatingly beautiful. Famous actor
points out how frustrating it is that people only ignore his
accomplishments and focus merely on his physical beauty. This is very
frustrating. So what is beauty? What does this mean we say we find--you
know, yeah, they really are very attractive people. What is it about
that that makes you look and say, "Yeah, that makes sense?" Well, we
kind of know the answer. We know some universals.</p>

<p>Beauty seems to signal two things. Beauty seems to signal youth--I
mean, not pre-school youth, but youth like sexually mature but young.
And so the cues we find beautiful are cues to that – large eyes, full
lips, smooth, tight skin. Beauty signals something else. Beauty is a
marker for health. And so what we find beautiful, things like the
absence of deformities, clear eyes, unblemished skin, intact teeth –
that's very big – and an average face. And that last part might seem a
little bit strange. What would be so good about an average face? And
there are different answers to that, but one answer is, an average
face, on average, should be considered attractive because any sort of
deformities are variations from the average. And if you average every
face together, you get a face that--where nothing bad has happened to
it. There's no distortion, there's no deviation. As one gets older, the
face gets less symmetrical and so on. Average-ness seems to factor out
all the bad things that could happen.</p>

<p>Good theory. How do we know it's true? Well, there's a photo roster
that comes--that I have access to for this class. So, I can look at
each of your pictures, and I will make you a bet about who has the most
beautiful face in this course. The bet is it would be all of you. Aw.
Wouldn't it be funny if I shouted out somebody's name? And you know, A)
I don't have the energy to do this, and B) it would probably violate
four hundred different privacy laws or whatever. But if I took all
those faces and morphed them together, I would get a very pretty face.
And how do we know this? Well, people have done this. They've done it
with--so look at the faces from here to here. And if you are like most
people, you see as you're going to the right they're looking better and
better and better. It's subtle, but it's actually not so subtle that
babies don't notice it. The same researchers who constructed
this--these face--these average Caucasian faces, male and female, have
shown these faces to babies and find that babies that prefer to look at
average faces--suggesting that our preference for averaging is not the
product of culture but rather is to some extent hard-wired.</p>

<p>These two people don't exist. They're computer composites. They're a
heavily averaged male face and a heavily averaged female face, both
from a Caucasian data sample. They don't look bad right? They're good
faces. They don't cheat. So the hair, for instance, is identical--so
they don't--you can't use hair cues. But they're pretty attractive. But
the story of attractiveness does not end there. How do you get a better
than average face? What can you do to these faces, these average faces,
and make them look even better? Well, I'll have a vote. Who's prettier?
Who says the one on the right? Who says the one on the left? Left is
average face, and there might be variation in this class. There are
definitely variations in what people favor. This is a feminized version
of the average face where certain prototype features were made more
feminine than average to cue this as more of a sexual object.</p>

<p>This is more complicated. Who thinks face A is more attractive?
[face A has exaggerated chiseled jaw and square chin] Who thinks face B
is more attractive? Okay. Most people like face B. The exception is,
and this has been statistically replicated, I think, now in three labs.
Face A is preferred by women who are ovulating, and the story about why
is complicated and will take us beyond the scope of this class. But
currently the idea is that this [face B] is a really handsome guy; he's
young, he's healthy, he looks strong, good provider; this guy [face A]
is really hot, and he may not be a good provider and everything, but
I'm sure he has wonderful genes. So, the idea is that one should have
sex with him [face A] and then have him [face B] raise the kids.</p>

<p>We've talked so far about things, about sex and sexual
attractiveness largely from a biological perspective, looking at
universals. And in fact, there are some universals in what men and
women have in common and what distinguishes men and women. And in some
of the sex differences, particularly related to aggression and mate
preference, seem to be universal. They seem to show up to some extent
across every culture you look at and, hence, are likely candidates for
biological adaptations. But there are other sex differences that people
are aware of where the origins are far less clear. And I think that
intelligent, reasonable people could disagree about this, but I am
personally quite skeptical about the extent to which these reflect
biology. I'll mention them to capture the debate, but the thing to keep
in mind here is that biology, natural selection, is one reason why the
men in this class might differ from the women in this class. But of
course, there are other, social, factors.</p>

<p>Babies are treated differently. There have been many studies where
you take a baby and swaddle it in blue and describe it as a boy versus
swaddle it in pink and describe it as a girl, and people treat it
differently when they think it's a boy than when they think it's a
girl. You're treated differently too. It matters a lot--and there's
study after study suggesting, for instance, that when you send an email
or a job application or a paper to a scientific journal, it matters
whether it has the name John Smith on it versus the name Joan Smith. It
matters because people have different expectations and different
reactions to males versus females. Some if you may have firsthand
experience with this if you're a man with a name that could be taken as
a woman's name – friend of mine is named Lynn, and often people think
he's female – or if you're a woman who has a name that could be taken
as a man's name, or if you have a name sufficiently foreign to Western
ears that people can't easily tell. You'll often find people saying,
"Oh," people are high-fiving each other there [referring to students in
the class]--you'll often find some degree of surprise and some degree
of people saying, "Oh my, I didn't know you were a man. Now I will
treat you differently." And so, these social factors could play a role
in explaining some male and female differences.</p>

<p>Also, there are the facts of gender self-segregation. So here
something very interesting happens developmentally. Males segregate
with other males; females segregate with other females--for a period
lasting, it depends on the culture, but say from age four to age
eleven. This self-segregation might exaggerate and enhance sex
differences. It might be, for instance, as Eleanor Maccoby has
proposed, that boys are slightly more aggressive than girls. But then
boys go into groups of boys, and that enhances and exaggerates their
aggression while the girls' non-aggressive behavior is enhanced and
exaggerated in different ways by them falling into girls' groups.</p>

<p>So, what sort of differences are we talking about when we say we're
not sure of their cause? Well, one difference is one in empathy. So
Simon Baron-Cohen wrote a wonderful book called <i>The Essential
Difference</i> where he argues that men are by nature less empathetic,
women are by nature more empathetic, and that this is a core sex
difference. So, what do you know? Well, what's the source for this? One
thing is men are more violent. Simon Baron-Cohen describes violence as
the ultimate act--murder as the ultimate act of a lack of empathy.
There's some relationship between how much testosterone you have in
your system and how social you are – more testosterone, less social.
Boys tend to be less empathetic than girls, and there's some evidence,
though it's not conclusive, that boys do worse than girls on social
cognition theory of mind tasks. That's what I have here, though that is
quite debated.</p>

<p>And the biggest effect, which isn't debated at all, is problems with
empathy, problems of social cognition, are much more frequent in men
than in women. So, these disorders like autism, Asperger's Syndrome,
conduct disorder and psychopathy are predominately male. And Simon
Baron-Cohen suggests that--basically, he has this slogan where he says,
"To be a man is to suffer from a particularly mild form of autism."
That males are just socially clueless relative to women. Final bit of
trivia--This is Simon Baron Cohen, who is a very famous developmental
psychologist, but his cousin Sasha Baron Cohen is far more famous.
Another debate is a debate concerning sex differences in the capacity
for math and science.</p>

<p>A few years ago there used to be a president of Harvard known as
Larry Summers. There are so many reasons to hiss at this point. And
Larry Summers is no longer president of Harvard for various reasons,
but one reason was this quote, which included in his speculations about
sex differences, "...in the special case of science and engineering,
there are issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the
variability of aptitude..." He argued, or suggested, that the
under-representation of women in the sciences in academia is because of
an intrinsic aptitude difference; women are, on average, less
biologically predisposed to do this sort of reasoning. The variability
point is that he wasn't suggesting that there's just a difference on
average. In fact, he agreed that the average skills of men and women
are identical. The claim is that males show more variation. This means
that there are more male retarded people and more males who are just
horribly bad at this, but it also means there are more male geniuses.
And he suggested that this plays a role.</p>

<p>This, as you can imagine, proved to be an extremely controversial
claim, and rather than go through it – because it would take me a class
to treat the pros and cons of this argument responsibly – I'm going to
refer you to a wonderful debate between Steve Pinker, who was quoted
earlier, and Liz Spelke who's one of the big infant cognition people.
And we spoke a lot about her work earlier on in the course. And they
have a wonderful debate between two of the smartest people I know on
<i>The Edge</i>, which was done at Harvard about a year ago and is on
video here
[http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/debate05/debate05_index.html]. So, if
you're interested in sex differences and different theories about the
mechanism of sex differences, this is where you should go.</p>

<p>Finally, and a final topic, some of us, about 98%--and the numbers
are very difficult to pin down. Maybe it isn't 98%; maybe it's
ninety-seven, maybe it's ninety-nine. Let's say 98% of women are
sexually attracted to men. About 96% of men are sexually attracted to
women. And the numbers vary and it's very difficult to estimate it
properly. As you could imagine, there are all sorts of problems with
this sort of research. But there's some proportion of the population
that's exclusively homosexual--some proportion of the population of men
who are only attracted to other men, some proportion of the population
of women who are only attracted to other women. When people talk about
sexual orientation here, it's important to realize we are not talking
here about behavior. There are all sorts of reasons why somebody might
have sex with somebody of the same sex. You know, they might be bored.
You may, you know, be experimenting, be whatever. The question is,
"What do you want to do?" All things being equal, what sort of
person--if you could be sexually or romantically involved with any
person, who would it be? And most people are heterosexual. There's a
considerable amount that varies cross-culturally of people who are
bisexual. But the real puzzle is exclusive homosexuality. So, why?</p>

<p>Well, nobody knows. We know some reasons, some answers are probably
not right. It is not the case, almost certainly – maybe there are some
exceptions – but it is not the case that people choose their sexual
orientation. I'm not going to do this in this room, but if you asked
people to raise their hands as to how many people decided who to become
sexually attracted to, very few people would. Part of the issue rises
in the fact that people who are gay are often extremely discriminated
against, and they have no wish to be gay. They might even think it's
morally wrong for them to be that way. That makes it implausible that
their sexual orientation is a conscious choice.</p>

<p>What about experience after puberty? So, there is a view that keeps
coming up over and over again in the literature that people who are gay
have in some sense been seduced by people, by other people--or
something happened to them afterwards. This seems unlikely. There are
in particular the seeds of sexual orientation later on in life seem to
show up quite early in life. Again, the studies are sort of suspect,
but there's some reason to believe that people who are gay and people
who are straight are different long before they hit puberty with regard
to their sexual and romantic fantasies.</p>

<p>You would now expect me to say, "Well, being gay and being straight
is built in. It's hard-wired. None of these stories seem right. It
seems to be built in." And the answer to that is, sort of. So, if you
do the standard behavioral genetic tests, and you by now know how to do
them--you'd look for differences between monozygotic and dizygotic
twins, you'd do the adoption comparison--you know adopted siblings and
biological siblings. The answer is yes, you find that there is some
sort of genetic predisposition towards homosexuality. But it can't be
entirely genetic. One reason why it can't be entirely genetic is, if
I'm gay and I have an identical twin, the odds that my identical twin
will be gay--it's about fifty percent. Those are very high odds
compared to the average in the population. But if it was truly genetic,
entirely genetic, what should the number be? A hundred percent – he's
my clone. He should be exactly as I am. And it's not. So, we know then
that some sort of experience, possibly prenatal experience, is what
explains it.</p>

<p>Why is it so – I said before this is a huge puzzle – why is it such
a huge puzzle? Well, exclusive homosexuality is an evolutionary
mystery. Again, do not think that this carries any moral weight to it.
What it does mean though is that it doesn't seem to follow as a
biological adaptation. The puzzle is not why is it that some men have
sex with men. That's not a big puzzle. Maybe they have sex with men as
some sort of recreational things or pair bonding or whatever. That's
not the puzzle.</p>

<p>The puzzle is why are there some men who don't want to have sex with
women? Similarly, why are there some women who don't want to have sex
with men? From an evolutionary adaptive standpoint, you would think
that the genes that give rise to such a behavior would be weeded out
because creatures with that behavior typically, putting aside modern
technology, don't have offspring. And that's what makes it such a
puzzle. So, your reading response for this week is "solve that puzzle."
I know I said early on in the course that reading responses would be
really easy and just require you reciting back things, but that proved
to be too boring. So, just solve this deepest of all puzzle. The thing
in brackets at the end is very important. Your account, whatever it is,
should bear some relationship to the facts as discussed in lectures and
readings. We have about five more minutes. Any questions or thoughts?
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: I like your leather jacket.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Thank you very much. She likes my
leather jacket. Any questions or thoughts, just like that one? No.
Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: My question's not exactly like that one, but in
other animals do they--is there similar data on other species?</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> On sexual preferences? That's a very
good question because certainly your answer to the origin – give me two
more minutes – certainly your answer about the origin of sexual
preference in humans will be informed by the question of cross-species
data. What we do know is that there are many animals that engage in
homosexual behavior; they engage in sex with members of their own sex.
What I don't know is whether you get exclusive homosexual behavior. So,
I don't know what the rate is in nonhuman primates, for instance, of
primates who do not want to have sex with members of the opposite sex.
Okay, I'll see you all Wednesday.</p>
