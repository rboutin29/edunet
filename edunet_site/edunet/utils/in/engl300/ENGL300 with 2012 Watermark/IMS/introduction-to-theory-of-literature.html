<h3>About the Course</h3>
<p>This is a survey of the main trends in twentieth-century literary theory. Lectures will provide background for the readings and explicate them where appropriate, while attempting to develop a coherent overall context that incorporates philosophical and social perspectives on the recurrent questions: what is literature, how is it produced, how can it be understood, and what is its purpose? <a href="/english/introduction-to-theory-of-literature/content/sessions.html"> view class sessions &gt;&gt;</a></p>
