<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>Professor Wai Chee Dimock concludes her discussion of <em>To Have and Have Not</em> by showing how, in the context of the Cuban Revolutions and the Great Depression, characters devolve into those who “Have” and those who “Have Not.” While protagonist Harry Morgan may look like a political and economic “Have Not”--he neither supports the revolution nor possesses enough money to extract himself from its seedier operations--his ability to bring happiness to his wife Marie makes him a social “Have” in a more profound sense. Dimock casts Harry as a “mediated Have,” someone who, through the eyes of others, might be said to be in possession of something vital, denied to others with material and political satisfactions.</p><p><em>Warning: This lecture contains graphic content and/or adult language that some users may find disturbing.</em></p>
