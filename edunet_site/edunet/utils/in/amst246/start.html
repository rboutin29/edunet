			<h3>About Professor Wai Chee Dimock</h3>
			<p>Wai Chee Dimock is William Lampson Professor of English &amp; American Studies at Yale University. Originally from Hong Kong, she received her BA from Harvard University and PhD from Yale University. Three concepts are important to Dimock: deep time; kinship among genres and media; and close reading. Her recent book, "Through Other Continents” (2006), received Honorable Mention for both the James Russell Lowell Prize of the Modern Language Association and the Harry Levin Prize of the American Comparative Literature Association. A collaborative volume, "Shades of the Planet,” further elaborates on these arguments. Outside Yale, Professor Dimock was a consultant for "Invitation to World Literature," a 13-part series produced by WGBH and aired on PBS stations in the fall of 2010. She is now working on two books, “Low Theory” and “Many Islams,” and a print-and-web anthology, “American Literature in the World.”</p>		</div>
