<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
What I want to do this morning is first of all begin by recapitulating a couple
of points that we made last time. You&#39;ll recognize our friend here, having her
blood feast, and last time we talked about the importance of malaria in human
history for a little bit, from ancient times to the contemporary world, and we
tried to suggest that malaria continues to impose an extraordinary burden of
suffering and death, along with those consequences that follow in its train:
poverty, low productivity, illiteracy, a low level of political, social and
education participation. </p>
<p>We also talked, as
you&#39;ll remember, about the transmission of the disease, with the complex
lifecycle of plasmodia and <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes. We talked about the
effect of the disease on the human body of the patient and symptoms that result
from malaria, and we tried to deal also with the great years of discovery at
the end of the 1890s, between 1898 and 1901, when the great mysteries of this
disease were largely unraveled in two different places. First in India, with
the collaboration of Ronald Ross and Patrick Manson, they demonstrated the
mosquito transmission of malaria with regard to avian malaria--that is, among
birds. And then the other place, even more importantly, was Italy, where
Giovanni Battista Grassi and other scientists of what was called the Italian
School, or the Rome School, proved the mosquito theory of transmission for human
beings. </p>
<p>I hope that in that
discussion, it was apparent to all of you that malaria is by far the most
complex of all the diseases that we&#39;ve studied, or will study, in our course.
And that point is important and underlies the fact that we spent a lot of time
talking about the complexity of the disease. It&#39;s important because it helps
us to understand a great deal of the history. One point is that if we
understand that, we&#39;re in a position to understand also why research on malaria
generated such intense intellectual excitement in the 1890s. It was then that
malariology because the centerpiece for the new medical discipline of tropical
medicine. Here was one of the world&#39;s oldest and most important public health
problems, and suddenly it was yielding its secrets. </p>
<p>There was a
tremendous excitement intellectually, and malariology attracted some of the
world&#39;s leading scientists and public health officials. We also wanted to talk
about the complexity of malaria, because a second reason is that it helps us to
understand why the public health strategies that we&#39;ve examined so far haven&#39;t
worked in dealing with malaria. If we think, for example, what are the main
public health strategies that we&#39;ve discussed so far--one was plague measures.
You know the drill by now: sanitary cordons, quarantines, isolation. These,
however, prove to be powerless against a disease that&#39;s borne by vectors as
efficient and mobile as <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes. </p>
<p>In high malarial
endemicity areas, mosquitoes are infinitely numerous and infinitely mobile.
Plague measures would be no help at all. We can understand also why another
form of public health was useless. The sanitary movement was irrelevant.
Malaria is not like cholera. It&#39;s not a disease of filth or the bacteria that
thrive in it. Places that are immaculately clean can be lethally infested with
mosquitoes and the plasmodia that they bear. Furthermore, malaria is a disease
of rural areas, primarily, and urban cleanups were therefore largely irrelevant
in combating it. So, a second strategy of public health that we&#39;ve confronted
so far was powerless in dealing with this disease. </p>
<p>Another public health
strategy that we&#39;ve examined was the strategy of vaccination, and we&#39;ve seen
that pioneered by Edward Jenner, and developed much more by Louis Pasteur. And
this too, thus far, has proved unavailing with regard to malaria. Let&#39;s think
for a moment about vaccines, and I&#39;d like to argue that they&#39;re effective
primarily under certain conditions, that they aren&#39;t universal panaceas for all
diseases. They&#39;re helpful primarily, first of all, in combating diseases
against which the body develops a robust acquired immunity. </p>
<p>Smallpox is a perfect
example. A patient who has once suffered from smallpox, but then recovers, is then
immune for the rest of his or her life. And, so, the strategy for vaccination
is to produce artificially the same effective immune response that was
generated by the naturally occurring infection. The strategy then is to
reproduce what nature does on her own. But in malaria, the immune response of
the body is limited, and it takes multiple infections and recovery there from
to acquire a partial immunity, and that immunity even then is short-lived.
It&#39;s partial and short-lived. </p>
<p>If you have painfully
acquired an immunity from malaria and then you move away from the malarial
area, in a couple of years your immunity fades away, and if you return to the
malaria area you&#39;re susceptible all over again. So, this is one factor that
makes vaccine development so very complicated. Another point about vaccine
development is that vaccines haven&#39;t so far been developed against a pathogen
with a lifecycle as complex as that of a plasmodium. </p>
<p>In targeting a virus
or bacterium, a vaccine is always dealing quite simply with the virus or the
bacterium. But the point about studying about--one of the points about
investigating the lifecycle of the plasmodium is that they&#39;re different. They
go through a series of complicated life stages. Sometimes they&#39;re sporozoites.
Sometimes they&#39;re merozoites. Sometimes they&#39;re gametocytes. And the problem
with a vaccine is that in order to be viable, it has to be effective against
all of those phases in the lifecycle of the plasmodium.</p>
<p>And then also another
feature, as I said, is that malaria is not a single disease. It&#39;s a family of
four different parasitic diseases, and the vaccine has to be effective against
not simply one, but against numerous, therefore, species of parasite. Now, I
don&#39;t want to argue that therefore the development of a vaccine against malaria
is impossible. In fact, as we&#39;re speaking, scientists are hard at work trying
to develop such a vaccine, and indeed, they have come up with one. You read
some rather silly things in the press. The vaccine developers came up with a
vaccine in the last few years that&#39;s about thirty-percent effective. </p>
<p>I remember reading in
places like the <i>New York Times</i> that malaria would therefore be
eradicated globally in five to seven years. This is a sort of rather silly
prediction, and even the people--I know because I&#39;ve talked to them--who are
developing the vaccine have no such illusion about its efficacy. They&#39;re
thrilled because it&#39;s thirty-percent effective, but that means that it&#39;s
seventy-percent not effective. </p>
<p>Well, in order to
understand the evolution of public health strategies against malaria and the
problem facing the world today in dealing with this disease, then we need to
know that the very complexity of malaria has led to a wide array of different
strategies to combat it, as well as to an ongoing debate on which course is
likely to be most effective. And as yet there&#39;s no consensus in the
international health community on the best and most effective strategy, despite
the fact that since the turn of the twentieth century, at the least, malaria is
a disease, paradoxically, that has such extraordinary ravages on the global
population, and yet, paradoxically, it&#39;s a disease that&#39;s both treatable and
preventable. There is an amazing paradox. </p>
<p>This morning, then, I
want to talk about not the effects, the nature of the plasmodium, the nature of
mosquitoes, the lifecycle or symptomatology of malaria, but I&#39;d like to look
instead at the disease from the societal point of view, and in particular on
efforts to development a successful antimalarial strategy. But developing a
strategy or thinking about the proper strategy against malaria is easier if we
think of a number of ways in which this disease might be characterized, the
ways in which it has been seen by leading scientists, physician, and public
health officials who&#39;ve dealt with it. So, I&#39;m wondering if we could think of
malaria--we might ask a number of questions about it. </p>
<p>How should we
describe this disease? Is it a disease of poverty, and what&#39;s the evidence for
that? That would entail dealing with--and in a particular way that might be
different from other ways. One of the leading world malariologists in the
early twentieth century defined malaria as a house disease. In other words,
it&#39;s primarily defined by poor housing conditions in which people are crowded
in order to work in agricultural occupations, and those houses are porous to
insects, and it&#39;s in the house that the disease is transmitted, and both
mosquitoes and human beings are infected. Or should we see it instead as an
occupational disease? We&#39;ve talked about the relationship of malaria to
agriculture, and it&#39;s quite clear that certain forms of agricultural production
create and generate high risk for those who practice them, and malaria is contracted
overwhelmingly by people who work in fields under certain conditions. </p>
<p>Another way of
thinking about it is, in that case, one way of attacking a malaria then would
be to have occupation improve the conditions of farming, of agriculture, to
regulate rice fields and all the rest of it. That would be what you would do,
perhaps, if you define it as an occupational disease. Should we think of it
instead as an environmental disease, that it&#39;s a disease that flourishes where
the environment has been degraded? Where there&#39;s been deforestation, for
example. Where the hydrology of rivers has been undermined. Where there&#39;s
flooding of places where there are swamps and impounded water. In that case,
the way of dealing with malaria, you might think, might be to have land
drainage, reclamation, environmental sanitation--quite a different strategy for
dealing with the disease. </p>
<p>What should we call
this particular disease? Is it an endemic disease, or is it an epidemic
disease? And here I think that malaria is one of those diseases that we&#39;re
studying in our course that&#39;s actually both. That is to say, in a particular
locality, it is an endemic disease. For example, if you were to go to the
tropical areas of Africa today, malaria is present throughout the year. It&#39;s
highly, even hyper endemic. But it&#39;s also capable of being an epidemic
disease. First of all, that&#39;s easiest to see, perhaps, it temperate zones
where malaria has also been prevalent, because then it&#39;s seasonal and you have
the winter when the disease--it&#39;s too cold for the plasmodium to be
transmitted, but you have an annual summer epidemic. But in addition, under
certain conditions we would say that the epidemic is intensified in conditions,
for example, of years of exceptionally heavy rainfall. Or, say, in tropical
Africa, it becomes an epidemic disease when something happens to the
environment, where there are complex emergencies or famines that cause people
to move in large numbers--who lack immunity to move to areas where the disease
is prevalent. </p>
<p>So, malaria can cause
extraordinarily intense epidemics against a background of being also an endemic
disease. I would like to argue, and I will be arguing that part of the
complexity of malaria--and if I were asked the question--although you may want
to disagree with me, because people are still arguing about how one defines a
malaria and how one deals with it. But I&#39;d like to suggest that perhaps it&#39;s
all of those. It&#39;s a disease of poverty. This is part of its complexity, its
biological, social, and environmental complexity. It is a disease of poverty.
It&#39;s also a house disease. It&#39;s an occupational disease. It&#39;s an
environmental disease. It&#39;s an endemic disease. And it&#39;s an epidemic disease
as well. </p>
<p>Well, what are the
kinds of strategies that have been deployed against this dreadful disease? One
was since we now know that it&#39;s transmitted by vectors, Ronald Ross, who was
one of the people who won the Nobel Prize, in fact for establishing that very
idea, developed very question the idea then if it&#39;s a disease that&#39;s
transmitted by vectors, perhaps the right course for dealing with malaria is
vector control. Kill mosquitoes by insecticides, or remove their breeding
grounds by environmental sanitation, by dealing with an unregulated hydrology
of an area, by land drainage, by removing uncovered water. </p>
<p>A different strategy
would be to deal with not the mosquito but with the plasmodium. And so there
have been--and here I&#39;ve talked about the Italian School of malariology, and
Giovanni Battista Grassi had the idea that you would be able to eradicate
malaria by the use of antiplasmodial--that is, quinine--one the first effective
magic bullets. He thought the idea was that if we know what causes malaria and
there is an effective treatment for it, if you can use it prophylactically to
prevent people from being infected for a number of seasons in a particular
geographical area, or if you can destroy the plasmodia in the bloodstreams of
all of the sufferers, then you can prevent mosquitoes from being infected for
the following year. And if you do that for several seasons, then you could
break the cycle of transmission and eradicate malaria. </p>
<p>Both of the people
who discovered the mosquito theory of transmission very quickly came to the idea
of malarial eradication. Ross did so, and Grassi immediately thought that
malaria had what he called--it was the &quot;colossus with feet of clay&quot;--and that
quinine would be the instrument that would enable the world to eradicate it.
But if you think of it as a disease of poverty, you might think instead--and a
disease of housing, and an occupation disease--then you might think of a
different strategy of social uplift, that what you need to do to deal with
malaria is to practice social medicine to deal with poor diet, poor wages,
child labor--those whole series of complex factors that create the substratum
in which malaria thrives. </p>
<p>And then there is
another strategy which is quite commonly thought of. It has not made much
progress, at least to date, though who knows, maybe it will in the future, and
that&#39;s the Jenner/Pasteurian strategy of hoping to develop an effective
antimalarial vaccine. So vaccine development is one of the great hopes in the
antimalarial struggle, and enormous amounts of resources are being invested in
antimalarial vaccine development as we speak. Well, I want to give an example
of a particular place. It&#39;s the one you&#39;re reading about this week, which was
the impact of malaria on a particular country. And I&#39;ve chosen Italy for particular
reasons. One is that Italy had a special relationship to malaria. It was the
only Western European country where it wasn&#39;t a colonial issue, but rather the
most important domestic public health problem. It was also the international
center of malariology from about 1900 until the Second World War. </p>
<p>In other words, we&#39;ve
talked about the hegemony of powers in international medicine in the early
nineteenth century down the middle of the nineteenth century. In the smaller
domain of malariology, Italy was the center of the action from 1900 until World
War II. This is the place where people went to be trained in malariology.
People traveled--physicians from all over the world--to study with those people
who were called the Rome School, or the Italian School of malariology--Giovanni
Battista Grassi most prominent. But other names were extremely prominent also,
like Angelo Celli, and we could list a whole series of others. And it was
Italians primarily who were responsible for unraveling the mysteries of
malaria. </p>
<p>And finally, Italy
was a place that did something quite extraordinary. It was the first place to
have a successful strategy of antimalarial campaigning. In other words, a
campaign began in 1900 and was successful in a eradicating malaria by 1962.
The last indigenous case of malaria in Italy was in Sicily in 1962. So, this
means that Italy has lessons, and there are not many places where there have
been campaigns that have succeeded intentionally in eradicating the disease. This
leads to a message of hope--what can be accomplished by doing it, and it also
means that I think it&#39;s useful to look at the this successful campaign in order
to draw lessons from it, but to beware also of the misuse of history, because a
lot of what I think are the wrong lessons have also been drawn from it.</p>
<p>Well, in any case,
let&#39;s look just very, very quickly at the Italian experience. As you know,
Italy was united in the middle of the nineteenth century, and by the 1880s the
new liberal regime became aware of the prevalence of the disease throughout the
country, and this is the map that was--it&#39;s not the best map artistically or
even in terms of clarity, or I would even say in terms of accuracy; and, so,
you&#39;re wondering why do I show you this map of malaria in Italy when there are
actually better maps that are more colorful and all the rest? But for
historians, this is the important one, because this is the one that shook
Italians up and convinced them of the enormity of the problem in their
country. </p>
<p>One of the things
that&#39;s quite clear, even in looking at this map, is that malaria was present
everywhere virtually. There are areas that are yellow, pink, and red of
prominence or extreme prominence of malaria. And it was the case also that
after unification, instead of the problem--unification seen as a foundational
moment for this new regime that&#39;s supposed to deliver civilization, economic
betterment, progress, and also public health--but instead, the years at the end
of the nineteenth century see the malarial problem, already intense, getting
worse. Worse because of things like deforestation of the Apennines. </p>
<p>The railroad era
actually had a devastating impact, because it led to the demand for trees to
make the railroad ties and the stations and all the rest, and therefore led to
massive deforestation and deregulation of the hydrology of the entire
peninsula, which was turned topsy-turvy. It was also a time then of economic
difficulties and crises, and malaria feeds on human misfortune, and it did so
in the late nineteenth century. Well, in any case, Italy also provided--we&#39;ve
talked about malaria as a housing disease--I thought I&#39;d just show you a
representative type of peasant housing, even down through the 1930s and &#39;40s,
and when you live in places like this, in a malarial area, you&#39;re highly
vulnerable because this is almost like being outdoors. In fact, it&#39;s probably
worse in terms of mosquitoes. It&#39;s entirely vulnerable and open to flying
insects, and having numerous people sleeping in conditions like this helps to
promote the disease and transmission. </p>
<p>Similarly, we talked
about it being an occupational disease. It wasn&#39;t by chance that Italy is also
a place of rice fields, and rice fields are actually wonderful places for
mosquitoes, and the rice workers were among those people who were most
vulnerable, and became symbolic as the victims of the plasmodia. So, in any
case then, there was an epidemic and endemic condition in Italy. And Italy
showed all of those terrible consequences of malaria that we&#39;ve been talking
about: absenteeism in agriculture; waste--whole areas that weren&#39;t cultivated
because they were so dangerous, and those who did work on them sickened and
died; an area of low productivity, of illiteracy; the underdevelopment of civil
society; low participation in politics; mass emigration. </p>
<p>And I would argue
indeed that one of the features of Italy is that we&#39;ve talked about North and
South, and I talked about agriculture being a determinant of malaria, and that
the global North had advanced forms of agriculture that were intensive and not
conducive to malaria; and the South, the global South, had the opposite. Well,
this was reproduced in a microcosm in Italy in that the North of Italy was much
less vulnerable to malaria, and the form of malaria was the milder <i>vivax</i>
malaria, while the South of Italy was riddled with malaria, and it was malaria
that predominantly <i>falciparum</i>; that is, the most devastating and lethal
form of the disease. </p>
<p>Well, there was a
time of great scientific discoveries that we&#39;ve talked about. Oh, this is a
famous picture, just to show you. This is a painting called &quot;Malaria,&quot; and as
you see, it&#39;s sort of like a <i>pietà</i>, or a deposition from the cross, and
I think it conveys, in a moving, emotional way, the reaction of a society to
intense malarial transmission. This is the prime minister at the turn of the
century until the First World War, under whom the antimalarial campaign gets
started. And this is Giovanni Battista Grassi--I tried to show him last
time--who was the person who proves the mosquito transmission among human
beings, the leading representative of the Rome School of malariology, and his
work was--we&#39;ve talked about institutions--this is the Santo Spirito Hospital,
where he conducted his research, because there were an enormous, almost
unending supply, of malarial patients. And it was here that he first
successfully infected human beings with malaria with a number of scientific
experiments, that you might consider ethically problematic, but in any case,
there weren&#39;t rules about such things at the turn of the twentieth century. </p>
<p>Well, the pillars of
the eradication program--the pillar of it was initially going to be quinine.
And so Italy passed a series of quinine laws from 1900 to 1907, with support
from the liberal prime minister. And the idea was that you could kill the plasmodia,
break the cycle of transmission, and eradicate the disease. Grassi thought it
would be merely a matter of a few years. In fact, it then turned out to be
impossible to eradicate the disease so easily that people were not used to
contact with physicians. There wasn&#39;t access, in other words, to medical
care. Distributing quinine was tremendously problematic. It also has to be
followed according to a very complex regimen, and it has to be followed for
months at a time, and you can&#39;t get people to do that unless they understand
the disease. </p>
<p>And, so, actually to
have an effective antimalarial program, turned out you have also to deal with
poverty and with illiteracy, which are the allies of the mosquito and of
malaria. And so it was important to teach people the discipline of quinine and
the reasons for it so very quickly, and also health access was important. And,
so, new parts of the program turned out to be rural health stations. It&#39;s
expanding now beyond quinine to include rural health stations, education and
rural schools. In other words, a whole panoply of things that we might call
social medicine, improved housing. Actually, Celli argues that trade unions
were a powerful antimalarial tool because they helped deliver better wages, and
with that, better diet and better clothing, and child labor laws--and we know
that children are particularly susceptible to malaria--and the regulation of
occupations that were particularly dangerous, such as working in rice fields. </p>
<p>Well, the results of
the liberal program, which has expanded well beyond distributing quinine--in
other words, it starts with the vision of a magic bullet and moves very quickly
to a whole panoply of things that we might, for shorthand, call social uplift,
with having to do with access to medical care, improved housing, civil
liberties, education, and all of those sorts of measures. The results of the
liberal program, by the eve of the First World War, were a massive decline in
mortality, at least, but still the persistence of the disease. And then comes
World War I, which was an extraordinary setback for malaria. And I&#39;ve talked
about the way that malaria is a disease that thrives on human misfortune, and
there is no misfortune that is better for malaria than war. </p>
<p>I thought I would
show you a few paintings of the First World War to show you the kinds of
conditions that led in Italy that destroyed, almost, the first fifteen, sixteen
years of antimalarial efforts, and created this huge explosion of epidemic
malaria during the First World War. And this is a famous painter--Sartorio is
his name--who was a combatant in the First World War, but then was wounded, and
returned to the front as a painter--rather, as a photographer--and he took
photographs of the conditions at the fighting front, and then he did paintings
from his photographs. And these are some of the most impressive, I think,
moving pictures of the sorts of conditions. You can see exactly how mosquitoes
would thrive in conditions of this sort. This is not dead soldiers. These are
soldiers bivouacking after a battle, and I think you can imagine them being
from non-malarial areas and not having resistance, and you can see that they
are a wonderful feast for <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes, and the soldiers from
non-malarial areas fell sick and died in enormous measures. </p>
<p>We&#39;ve talked about
malaria as a housing disease. Well, also the destruction of housing renders
people vulnerable; if you have to move into tents or into the open fields to
bivouac, to move from area to area, from cities to the rural areas and all the
rest of it, you become extraordinarily vulnerable. And, so, the destruction of
housing and the housing stock was extremely important. So, there was this
tremendous upsurge of malaria during the First World War. After the First
World War, in 1922, we have a new regime, and this was the fascist regime of
Benito Mussolini. We won&#39;t talk about the conditions that brought Mussolini to
power, but we now have a totalitarian, one-party dictatorship--the end of
elections, police repression, violence, the secret police, and a foreign policy
of expansion to restore an empire and to pursue broad European and African
conquest. </p>
<p>By the end of the
1920s, Mussolini is fully in power, and he institutes some antimalarial
measures that became extremely famous, and he&#39;s often thought as a hero of the
antimalarial movement because of what he did in this area--the Pontine
Marshes--which is just outside of Rome, and you&#39;ll be reading about that. This
was done, however, for political purposes more than for medical ones, because
the point about the Pontine Marshes was that only a couple of thousand people
lived there in 1930, and this became the height of the regime&#39;s antimalarial
measures, which were to drain the swamps, to build new housing, and to settle
the land. But it doesn&#39;t actually confront malaria in the parts of Italy where
the most numerous people were getting ill and dying. It was an enormous propaganda
effort to demonstrate, more than health, the power of the regime: that
Mussolini could succeed where liberals had failed, where the popes had
failed. </p>
<p>The sorts of measures
that were undertaken, this is the kinds of conditions that he found--the swamp
conditions. I guess I&#39;m overdoing it, but I&#39;m showing you there was plenty of
water and there were plenty of mosquitoes, and it was estimated that you had an
eighty percent chance of contracting malaria if you spent a single night in
this area in the summer, before the drainage of the swamps. Well, this is the
construction of something modestly called the Mussolini Canal, and we&#39;ll see
also it went pumping stations, land drainage; you see canals being constructed;
water being raised to be harmlessly diverted to the sea went with it as well;
the distribution of quinine--I&#39;m showing quinine being distributed; education
and literacy, and the teaching about the mosquito theory of transmission--all
of that was important. </p>
<p>We see fascist Boy
Scouts learning about larvae and their collection, and taking that information
home to their families, was part of the idea. Here they&#39;re doing the same
thing. There were sanatoria. And you see the improved housing. These are
sturdy houses. They have screened windows and all the rest of it. You see
screens going up. So, this was really a huge, huge project. It also included
things that weren&#39;t so--the building of new cities. Suddenly an area that was
a swamp, you see modern cities going up. The display of power is enormous. This
was really an idea that had as much to do with the power of the regime as with
public health. I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s my view that fascism is in fact bad
for your health rather than good for it. </p>
<p>Here are some of the
propaganda pictures of the first peasant of Italy here, among his smiling,
happy crowds, and all the rest of it. So, this was used in that way. Well
then, part of fascism, however, you can&#39;t understand it without its impetus to
expansion and to war. And the Second World War, again, led to a major
destruction and to devastation, repeating even a worse scale what had happened
during the First World War. So, I won&#39;t talk about that. I won&#39;t talk either
this morning about a war crime that I do discuss in the book, that will see the
use of malaria as an instrument of bioterrorism. But my theme this morning is
what are the tools for dealing with malaria, and the lessons that can be
learned. </p>
<p>And, so, I&#39;d like to
look then--with the downfall of fascism and another terrible upsurge of malaria
during the Second World War, there is a campaign to eradicate malaria that gets
underway 1945-1946, and succeeds by 1962. And it&#39;s done with Allied
cooperation, the leadership of the Rockefeller Foundation and money from this
country, and it involves the idea of a powerful new weapon to destroy
mosquitoes--a technological weapon. DDT was discovered during the war and is
now used as an instrument, a powerful insecticide, to destroy malaria. And
this is thought, in fact, to be--and becomes--a premise, if we like. The
lesson is drawn that malaria was eradicated in Italy after the use of DDT, and
so DDT is thought to be the cause of the destruction of malaria, the successful
campaign. And this becomes the premise for an international campaign, a global
campaign, of the World Health Organization from 1955 until 1969 to use DDT
worldwide to eradicate malaria globally. </p>
<p>I want to argue that
this is in fact misleading, because the wrong lessons were drawn from what
happened in Italy. In actual fact, the eradication after World War II was
possible in part because it marked not only the use of DDT, but it also meant a
massive investment of American aid to provide food, clothing, housing and
employment, that becomes, first, UNRA, and then the Marshall Aid Plan. And so
there is an enormous campaign to improve housing and conditions of people. In
other words, there&#39;s a massive social uplift, if we like, that&#39;s going along at
the same time as the use of DDT. At the same time, you have the reestablishment
of healthcare services and rural health stations, and the massive distribution
of quinine and artificial quinines developed during the war--Atabrine and
chloroquine. </p>
<p>So, it&#39;s not a
simple, unidimensional program that succeeds. By 1962, Italy becomes
malaria-free, and I think that&#39;s one of the factors that led to the possibility
of the economic miracle, and Italy&#39;s becoming after, by our day, the world&#39;s
seventh industrial power. So, there&#39;s an amazing measure of hope of what can
be done. When you eradicate malaria, you unleash productivity and
development. But in addition, this example then becomes the basis of the post
World War II program of global eradication that believed that it would be
possible simply to have a panacea, a technological intervention with DDT, and
this is an experiment that by 1969 collapses in failure, and I would like to
argue that this ought to lead us to enormous questions about today&#39;s
antimalarial program of the World Health Organization, Roll Back Malaria, and
very often it&#39;s thought that the development of using some sort of magic bullet
would be adequate. </p>
<p>I want to argue that
this was partly based on a misunderstanding of the Italian lesson, and I think
we&#39;re dealing with, in our own world, the consequences of that in the form,
now, of either DDT- or insecticide-treated bed nets as being the most useful
instruments; and I think the campaign is having enormous difficulties, and I
think we need to think about how we define this disease--what is its
substratum; what conditions promote it; and what kinds of strategies are
effective in combating it. So, thank you.</p>
