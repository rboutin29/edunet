<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
And with that, I&#39;d like to turn to our subject for the morning, which is about
the third--it&#39;s the third in our series of lectures on bubonic plague, and I&#39;d
like to talk about the effects, or some of the effects, of bubonic plaque on
European culture. We&#39;ve been trying to suggest that plague had a major impact
on European society, and I want to be arguing that that impact was felt not
only on political events but also on culture and intellectual life, and I&#39;d
like to look at that this morning. </p>
<p>But I want us to
remember that when we&#39;re talking about those effects, I&#39;ll be trying to say it
was the effects not only of plague itself as a disease, but also the impact of
the organized reaction to plague, the anti-plague measures, and the sense that
for the first time society had means that were effective, and could protect
itself against this dreadful outside visitor. Well, let&#39;s start again at the
beginning. And, as you know, there is a biblical interpretation for the themes
of this course. And this is the one that you&#39;re now well familiar with; this
is the Fall. </p>
<p>This is Adam and Eve,
as painted by the greatest of all--perhaps the greatest of all--plague
painters, Jacopo Tintoretto, who was a painter in Venice and lived from 1518 to
1594. You know this is the story of Genesis; that Adam and Eve tasted of the
fruit that they were forbidden, and as a result they were expelled from the
garden and for the first time became subject to death, and also to disease and
illness. And if we move forward, this is the next step. You saw the original sin.
This is Masaccio&#39;s--one of the great painters of the Italian Renaissance--this
is his painting, in the Brancacci Chapel in Florence, of the expulsion from the
garden. And you know they&#39;re looking extremely miserable. Not only are they
going to die and become ill and experience pain in childbirth, but they&#39;re
also--and I&#39;m sorry about this--they&#39;re going to have to work. So this is a
tremendously painful experience, and you can see the pain written in their
faces, of Adam and Eve. </p>
<p>So that, in a way, is
a story of our course. And I&#39;d like to talk now about some attitudes towards
what followed--that is, illness and death--just before the arrival of the Black
Death. And I&#39;d like to refer to the work of a French historian who died fairly
recently and was the great, perhaps, historian of death. His name is Phillippe
Ariès, and he had an
idea, that before the Black Death, he talked of it as &quot;death tamed.&quot;
That is, there were ways that people had beliefs, practices and rituals, that
helped them to face the issue of our mortality; to cope with loss; to heal the
tear that was caused in a family or a community, the loss of a member of a
family; and also to express grief and to pay one&#39;s last respects. And there
were two great aids in doing that. One we might say was the <i>ars moriendi</i>,
which was &quot;the art of dying.&quot; </p>
<p>There were certain
rules that you should be aware of that would prepare you for the final moment
and the passage from this life to the next. And then there were what were
called a <i>memento mori</i>, which is a reminder of death; that is, a
reminder--you should surround yourself with reminders that it&#39;s time to get
ready, because any day could be the last and death could come very soon. We&#39;ll
see the art of dying portrayed in instructions; sometimes in paintings or
engravings; also in books on how to die properly, according to Christian
doctrine--who should be there?; what are the last rites?; that is, extreme
unction--the final confessions of sins; the last communion and viaticum; the
funeral rites; the laying out of the body; the wake; the procession, with
perhaps a town crier announcing the event; the funeral service and a burial
ceremony with a blessing; an interment in consecrated ground; and finally a
funeral meal for surviving friends and relatives. </p>
<p>Leading themes in
this are themes of solidarity, dignity and community. And in this slide of the
<i>ars moriendi</i>, we see a dying person inhabiting two worlds: the natural
world he&#39;s about to leave with possessions, friends, family and home, and a
supernatural world he&#39;s about to enter, and that only he can see, but is
represented by angels and devils vying for his soul. We can also see in
another example by Nicolas Poussin, also a great seventeenth century French
painter, who--this is a painting of extreme unction. It&#39;s an illustration of
the good death to which everyone should aspire. </p>
<p>Now, the seventeenth
century, the time of Defoe&#39;s great work, also witnessed in Britain the
publication of the work of one of the most famous of all writers on the theme
of <i>ars moriendi</i>, the art of dying; that was the extraordinary Anglican
preacher and bishop, Jeremy Taylor, who lived from 1613 to 1667, and wrote two
major works, both of which have gone through edition after edition, they were
so popular and so influential. The first was called <i>The Rule and Exercises
of Holy Living</i>, of 1650, and the other was <i>The Rule and Exercise of Holy
Dying</i>, of 1651. Taylor argued that this life is short and unimportant, and
so we should use our time primarily to prepare for the eternal world, making
certain that we die with our worldly affairs in good order, and with our souls
in a state of grace, prepared to meet our maker on Judgment Day. His books
then were instructional manuals on how to do that. And he reminds us that
there really isn&#39;t a moment to waste, especially with the threat of plague
ever-present, with sudden death that could happen any moment now. </p>
<p>So, Phillippe Ariès thinks then the
opposite of the good death is death by bubonic plague. That is something we
might call &quot;death unleashed,&quot; a sudden mass death for which society
had no defenses, and no one was prepared. This sudden death is <i>mors
repentina</i>--sudden death--which was always feared. Because sudden death
catches a person unprepared, with his will unwritten in this world, and his
soul in a state of sin that could lead to eternal damnation in the next. And
death from plague was not only sudden but, as we know now, agonizing and
dehumanizing. It often meant that the sufferer was alone and abandoned, and it
was death without the attentions of the clergy, without funeral rites and
proper burial. Or your body was hurled unceremoniously into a mass plague pit;
burned perhaps; thrown into the sea, picked over by vultures and crows. </p>
<p>Now, remember, don&#39;t
think that this fear of <i>mors repentina</i> was something medieval and very
distant from us, or simply early modern. The historian Drew Faust, in her
extraordinary recent book on the American Civil War, <i>This Republic of
Suffering</i>, places the fear precisely of <i>mors repentina</i> at the center
of her account of the Civil War. It was a widespread anxiety, pervasive among
the soldiers on both sides of the conflict, and it recurred again and again in
the letters they wrote home. Total war, like bubonic plague, provides
unlimited opportunity for an unprepared and sudden death that could set us all
on the wrong path for eternal life. Well, literature also gives expression to
this new and horrifying reality. You&#39;ve seen Boccaccio in his introduction to <i>The
Decameron</i>. You&#39;re reading Defoe and <i>The Journal of the Plague Year</i>.
You could read about it again in Camus&#39; <i>The Plague</i>, or Edgar Allan Poe&#39;s
short story, &quot;Mask of the Red Death.&quot;</p>
<p>Remember too that
another aspect of <i>mors repentina</i>, the sudden unprepared death, was the
fear of premature burial. The certification of death in the early modern
world, say at the time Defoe was writing, was extremely imprecise. The only
really certain indication was putrefaction. And, so, those religious rites of
laying out--the wake, the funeral procession and so forth--were practical, in
that they allowed time, and they ensured observation, to be certain that the
dead person really was dead before being interred. But plague, on the other
hand--we&#39;ve seen the plague regulations. They meant instead a rapid, hasty
burial, with no attention and no observation, and isolation raised a real
danger of being buried alive. </p>
<p>In times of epidemic
diseases that swept populations, this fear of death was very pervasive. And
we&#39;ll come back to it when we talk about cholera in the nineteenth century,
when the cemeteries had all sorts of experiments with providing caskets with
little bells above ground and a rope underground, so that someone could raise
the alarm if they woke up unexpectedly. So, the plague then really led to
death unleashed. Let&#39;s look at some of the portrayals of it, in painting and
sculpture, from the plague centuries of the second pandemic--remember, from
1347 to 1743. Here&#39;s a bas-relief of Pierre Puget. This was the plague in
Marseilles, and I think one can see the extraordinary portrayal. </p>
<p>I wanted to move on
though to this particular painting, one of the most important of the plague
years. And this again is Poussin, whom you saw earlier telling you how to die
properly, what the good death should look like, who should be there and all the
rest. This is his famous painting of 1631, now in the Louvre in Paris, called
&quot;The Plague of Ashdod.&quot; Let me remind you, it&#39;s again a biblically
inspired painting. Let me remind you of what Ashdod was. The story is from
the First Book of Samuel in the Old Testament. Ashdod was a city in the Holy
Land near Gaza, occupied in biblical times by the Philistines who worshipped
the idol Dagon. The Philistines defied the Israelites in battle, and
confiscated the Arc of the Covenant as war bootie, and set it up in the Temple
of Dagon in Ashdod.</p>
<p>So, the Book of Samuel
tells us: &quot;And so it was. The hand of the Lord was against the city, with
a very great destruction. And the Lord smote the men of the city, both small
and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.&quot; A special reward
to any of you who tell me what an emerod actually is. But anyway, this slide
is about the destruction of the great temple of Dagon. You can see that here.
This may be the Arc of the Covenant. It is, then--again we can see it&#39;s a
representation in painting of plague as being a punishment for divine anger and
for sin. Some of the things we can note are the gruesome and particular
details. We can see that there are rats scurrying. You know the role that
rats played in plague. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s look--here we
can see our friend <i>Rattus rattus</i> playing a starring role. Or let&#39;s
notice, again in the foreground, the attempt--the terrifying, haunting
attempt--of a baby to suckle its mother who&#39;s dying--I&#39;m sorry, that was in the
preceding, and that&#39;s here in the foreground. And we&#39;ll look at this person
here. And we can see the passerby holding his nose because of the stench of
the victims and the fear of miasma. Or let&#39;s look at another portrayal. And
this is Pietro Gaetano &quot;The Plague of the Late-Seventeenth Century.&quot;
Or quite a terrifying picture by Micco Spadara, &quot;The Plague of Naples in
1656.&quot;</p>
<p>While we look at
this, let&#39;s think of the reference that it&#39;s making. You can see that things
are happening in the heavens. And this is Naples being devastated by the
plague. There are plague pits and all the rest of it in this picture. I think
we should remember how people thought of this. It seemed to be an acting-out
of the Book of Revelations, the day of the Apocalypse. The <i>Dies Irae</i>,
the day of wrath, and the Lord&#39;s judgment, when the lamb opened the Great Book,
closed with seven seals; and that&#39;s the reference in Bergman&#39;s film to <i>The
Seventh Seal</i>. </p>
<p>And in the Book of
Revelations, let me remind you of what people were thinking at times like
this. In Chapter VI it says: &quot;And I saw when the lamb opened one of the
seals. And I saw him behold there was a white horse. And he that sat on him
had a bow, and he went forth conquering and to conquer. And when he&#39;d opened
the second seal, there went out another horse that was red, and power was given
to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, that they should kill one
another. And when he had opened the third seal, I beheld a black horse, and he
that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And he opened the fourth
seal. I looked and beheld a pale horse, and he that sat on him was death, and
hell followed with him... At last the lamb opened the seventh seal and seven
angels appeared, bringing the wrath of God. There was thunder, lightening and
earthquake. The sea turned to blood. The grasses were burned up. The waters
turned to wormwood. The sun and moon were smitten and a bottomless pit
opened. And I saw another sign in the heavens, great and marvelous: seven
angels bringing the seven last plagues. For in them is filled up the wrath of
God. And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels,
&#39;Go your ways and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth&#39;. And
the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air. And thence came a great
voice saying, &#39;It is done.&#39;&quot; I think that&#39;s what&#39;s happening in the
heavens here. </p>
<p>Well, other examples
of death unleashed are portrayed in the theme that was common in European
painting in the time of bubonic plague, during the plague centuries, and that&#39;s
the theme of the triumph of death, which is often complete with the horsemen of
the Apocalypse, that I just read to you about, and a usual scene is a great
cart, pulled by oxen, driven by the figure of death, wielding a great scythe,
while before him there goes the Angel of Death blowing a trumpet. And all
around you may see dead people and graves that are opening and skeletons. Let
me give you one of the scariest paintings I know. This is Pieter Bruegel the
Elder, who lived in the sixteenth century. And this is &quot;The Triumph of
Death,&quot; now hanging in the Prado in Madrid. And if you look at the
details, I think it becomes all the more disturbing, the closer you look at
it. You see death coming with his scythe and mowing down the population in their
masses, which is what bubonic plague does in particular. </p>
<p>We can look at
another artist. This is Andrea Mantegna, who died in 1506, his painting
&quot;The Triumph of Death.&quot; There were other new themes in European art
that emerged during the plague centuries. And one of these, that I&#39;ll show in
a minute--which is not this--but will be the theme of <i>vanitas</i>; a new
theme in European art during the plague centuries, when death was unleashed in
Europe repeatedly. <i>Vanitas</i>, as a theme, flowered in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. Now what did it mean? Well, <i>vanitas</i> paintings
were meant to display the temporal goods of this world: flowers perhaps;
fruits; symbols of learning and culture such as musical instruments or books;
or signs of earthly achievement and wealth, like gold and jewels. But they&#39;re
juxtaposed to striking and more shocking symbols of what&#39;s meant to be the
deeper reality of this transitory, fragile life that we live, and the imminence
of death. </p>
<p>And, so, alongside
these earthly things, you&#39;ll see a skull; a candle whose flame has just gone
out; an hourglass marking the passage of time; the crossbones. And the message
is--that also is a biblical one--vanity from Ecclesiastes. Let me just read
you a sentence. &quot;What profit hath a man of his labor under the sun? One
generation passeth away and another generation cometh.&quot; In an age of
sudden mass death, human achievement was futile and impermanent, and you should
instead be preparing yourselves for the true reality of death and the ever-lasting
life. Now, this we can see directly linked to what you&#39;re reading about in Defoe.
</p>
<p>Here we have the
London Bills of Mortality, in 1664 to 1665; years that you know and are coming
to love. And this is the illustration that introduced the bills. It helps us
to make the direct connection between plague and the iconography I&#39;ve just been
talking about. You&#39;ll notice that the symbols are the classic <i>vanitas</i>
symbols of the seventeenth century. You see the skeleton, the crossbones, the
shovel and all the rest of it, all around the edges. The skull, the hourglass
here. The time is running out. And indeed you&#39;ll see right here that this is--the
inscription is a <i>memento mori</i>. This is to remind you that death is
coming and could strike at any moment, and you had best prepare. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at another
painting of these centuries. This is Lucas Furtenagel--well, this actually isn&#39;t,
I&#39;m sorry. This is a different one. But let me move--you can see in this
painting again the candle going out. You can see the skull and human
achievements. All are vanity, is the lesson. Or this, rather--this is the one
I was mentioning; Lucas Rutenagel, in the sixteenth century in Germany. This
is &quot;Hans Burgkmair and His Wife,&quot; a painting of 1527. And the point is that
looking in the mirror, they see the true reality of themselves, which is their
skulls after death. And, so, this is reminding us that this is the true
reality that lies beneath all of us. Or let&#39;s look at another painting. </p>
<p>This is Harmen
Steenwyck, a painting called &quot;Vanitas,&quot; of 1640. I&#39;m trying to show
you paintings from different countries, from England, France, the Low
Countries, Germany and so on. This is the Low Countries. And this painting,
housed in Leiden, and is quite clearly about exactly what we&#39;ve been talking
about; the candle, the skull, the books that are evanescent. Or more subtly
but quite famously, this is Hans Holbein the Younger&#39;s painting called
&quot;The Ambassadors,&quot; which now hangs in London in the National
Gallery. It&#39;s an ironic commentary on the court of Henry VIII. All about the
painting you see the display of symbols of wealth, power and learning: elegant
costumes, the globe, the book, musical instruments. But in somber
juxtaposition to them all is the apparent smudge in the foreground of the
painting. But if you look at it closely, what it actually is, is a large and
perfectly constructed skull, seen from a different perspective; a technique
known as an anamorphosis. Let&#39;s look at one more vanitas. This is Renard de
Saint-Andre&#39;s seventeenth-century painting called, appropriately,
&quot;Vanitas&quot;. I think you get the picture. </p>
<p>Another theme of
these centuries, of death unleashed, is the theme called the <i>danse macabre</i>,
the dance of death. Now, let me stress that once again this is not a school of
painting. This is part of the iconography. It&#39;s the theme in the painting.
It appears as a common motif in European Art, from the mid-fourteenth century
to the sixteenth; in paintings, in prints and very importantly on tombstones.
It began with the Black Death. And with the eighteenth century and the
vanishing of the plague, it becomes rarer and rarer, it more or less fades
out. </p>
<p>The <i>danse macabre</i>
portrays death as a skeleton, inviting people of all ages, ranks and sexes to
join in the merry dance of death. And death is usually armed with a scythe, or
an arrow, or a dart, and often plays a musical instrument. In the words of <i>The
Catholic Encyclopedia</i>: &quot;The Black Death brought before popular
imagination the subject of death and its universal sway, as never before. At
this time, death appeared as the messenger of God, summoning men to the world
beyond the grave. During those years, many churches enacted literal dances of
death, or transformed it into a play conveying the idea of the fragility of
life and the nearness of death and the need for repentance.&quot; There are
other examples. </p>
<p>I&#39;d like to show you
five slides from St. Mary&#39;s Church of Lübeck in Germany. A glorious mural from 1463,
one of the glories of the Renaissance in Germany. But unfortunately it was
destroyed by Allied bombing in the war, and so there&#39;s only a black and white
reproduction that I can show you. But the theme comes across quite clearly,
and is a good example of the <i>danse macabre</i>. What it is, is a portrayal,
in separate paintings, of a whole society suddenly summoned by Angel of Death,
the bubonic plague. The first one is the pope and the emperor being summoned
by death. It doesn&#39;t matter who you are, everyone falls victim in time of
plague. Well, here we see another level of society, a canon and a nobleman
being called again by death. Or the third is the parish priest and the
artisan, who are also being asked to take part in the dance, and then the
priest and peasant. The whole of society, in other words, is being stricken by
mass death. And here we have youth, a maiden and a baby. So, we have a
portrayal, in a sense, of universal death. This was important in the time of
bubonic plague. </p>
<p>There was another
major development of the plague centuries, and this was the emergence of cults
of famous plague saints. Saint Sebastian, San Rocco and Saint George. And
let&#39;s look then at four pictures of Saint Sebastian, from four of the great
artists of the Plague Era. You remember why Saint Sebastian was so important?
Because the arrows were symbols of the plague, and Saint Sebastian is offering
his body to defend humanity against the wrath of the Lord. And Saint Sebastian
is a theme who becomes very important in these centuries, for the first time in
European painting. This is Sandro Botticelli&#39;s painting of Saint Sebastian of
1484. Or let me show you another major painter, Raphael&#39;s &quot;Saint Sebastian.&quot;
Or let me show you Guido Reni&#39;s picture of him. Or finally, from the Low
Countries, Hendrick ter Brugghen&#39;s early-seventeenth-century painting, 1635,
Saint Sebastian. </p>
<p>It was also, as I
said, --the time of the cult of another saint--and this is Saint Roch, or we can
call him San Rocco. You know his life already. He was from Montpellier in
France, and devoted himself during his travels to tending the plaque-stricken
in Italy, and protecting the faithful. After his death, then, his intercession
was invoked across Europe, and his cult spread from country to country. Often
we see Sebastian and Rocco painted together. This is Andrea da Murano, &quot;Christ
Embracing the Saints,&quot; Sebastian here to his right, and San Rocco to his left.
And you can almost always tell that San Rocco has the bubo in his thigh. It&#39;s
clearly the bubonic plague that&#39;s being referred to here. Or Francesco Vecellio--this
is the Madonna, between Sebastian here and San Rocco there. </p>
<p>In addition, it was
larger scale than just paintings. It also affected architecture across Europe,
and churches were built to San Rocco across Europe, in France, in Austria, in
Vienna, in Rome. But I think if we&#39;re going to talk about plague and its
impact on the built environment and architecture, as well as painting, I think
the best place we could go is Venice. Venice, as you know, because of its site
in the Mediterranean, at the center of the trade routes, was scourged again and
again by bubonic plague, and was the place that first devised the anti-plague
measures. So, Venice has a deep association with bubonic plague, and it left
its imprint in stone and on canvas. I&#39;d like to look at some of--if you were to
visit Venice, you would see that its whole urban landscape is deeply affected
by bubonic plague. Also, even the gondolas are, in fact, a reference--that&#39;s
why they&#39;re black--to bubonic plague; from conveying the bodies at the time. </p>
<p>This is the church of
Saint Mary of Health [Santa Maria della Salute], built in the 1530s. And what
it&#39;s doing is after the plague had passed, this is a church that&#39;s built to
commemorate the passage of plague, and to thank God for allowing his wrath to
be assuaged, and for health to be returned. And, so, that&#39;s why we have one of
the most important churches in Venice is Saint Mary of Health. And these are a
couple of closer pictures of it. And that&#39;s moving into the interior. Let me
also show you another church. </p>
<p>This is the Church of
the Redeemer, and it&#39;s a church also built at time of plague to thank God for
the assuaging of his wrath and the survival of the city. A closer picture.
And we&#39;ll move on. This is again one of the glories of Venetian art. It&#39;s
called the
Scuola Grande di <em>San Rocco</em><em><i>,</i></em> which is the Great School of Saint Rocco.
Let&#39;s remember what the school meant. There were three-hundred or so so-called
&quot;schools&quot; at Venice in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. What they were
is confraternities, associations of laymen, including the leading trades of the
city. Some of them had large and wealthy memberships, and played a major role
in the government of the city, and amassed enormous wealth. </p>
<p>The functions of the
confraternities were originally devotional. And given the exposure of Venice
to the plague, it&#39;s not surprising that the very largest and most powerful of
the schools chose Saint Rocco as its patron saint. And this is--it bears the
name. It constructed a magnificent building, and commissioned the greatest
Venetian artist of the century, Jacopo Tintoretto, to decorate it, in
veneration of Saint Rocco, and in direct rivalry to the Sistine Chapel in
Rome. So, let&#39;s move inside. There we are. And we&#39;ll see that we&#39;re looking
at--in these plague scenes, we&#39;ll be seeing that we&#39;re going to look at the
magnificence of the art. And this is the interior of it. </p>
<p>I just wanted to show
you that at the height of the painting is Tintoretto&#39;s painting of the Triumph
of San Rocco; San Rocco, the great plague saint, achieving his reward in heaven
and going up to God. Plague also affected across Europe. Let me also say
another theme in the urban landscape involved plague columns. And you can see
these, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, a great plague column in the
center of Vienna, or also in Pilsen in the Czech Republic. Or in--here&#39;s yet
another in Hungary. Now, in these plague scenes, of course, remember that by
definition we&#39;re looking at works by survivors, whose sense of horror was
tempered perhaps by a bit of relief. If it were possible to have works by the
victims, perhaps the scenes would be even more wrenching. There are also
aspects that aren&#39;t mentioned in the literature and are unknowable, but perhaps
probable. </p>
<p>What happened to
those who suffered from the plague and then were recovered? Was their
fertility affected? Were there long-term sequelae and neurological deficits?
Were there psychological effects that we would now term posttraumatic stress
syndrome? But in our discussion of plague, I also want to say that there were
a couple of speculative, large-scale conclusions that I want to hint at. The
presence of plague over four centuries, as we&#39;ve just seen, had a major impact on
religion, on culture, on societal attitudes toward life and death, and left a
major imprint on architecture, on painting and sculpture. In addition, I want
to speculate for a moment and say that we might also think that perhaps the
plague--and especially not the plague itself, but the triumph over it, by the
means we described last time--may have been a factor that helped to transform
European intellectual history. </p>
<p>Now, it&#39;s one of the
great clichés that the eighteenth century, the Age of Enlightenment, was a
great age of optimism and belief in progress. But I&#39;d argue that perhaps the
belief in progress required some tangible material foundation, and that this
was grounded in a new sense that life, in fact, was becoming more secure, and
that perhaps mankind could master its environment and its destiny. And, so, I
would argue that it&#39;s very significant that the first great medical
conquest--at least public health conquest--resulted from the application of the
power of the state, of administrative measures in the plague regulations. And
it&#39;s no coincidence then that the eighteenth century--and during this time, the
State came to be seen as a source of redeeming power, that could transform
human lifeand society. Here was an impetus towards reform, and a re-thinking
intellectually. </p>
<p>Medical history, in a
sense, one could argue, was one factor that helped to sound the death knell of
the old regime, dramatically and successfully demonstrating humans&#39; capacity--that
is, man&#39;s capacity to make his or her own history. Here was a basis for a new
faith in reason, and the creative potential of political power. Perhaps it&#39;s
suggestive to remember that Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the founder of modern
revolutionary political thought, began his--and one of the heroes of the
Enlightenment--began his career in Venice, which for a time he regarded as a
model regime. And that his time there included a month of reflection, as he
underwent a term of quarantine in the great Venetian lazaretto. But again, I
want to avoid giving any suggestion that I want to propound a germ theory of
history. </p>
<p>As a historian, I&#39;m
opposed, by training, to mono-causal explanations of major events. And, so,
what I&#39;m not saying is that the conquest of the plague caused the
Enlightenment; I&#39;m not saying that. I merely want to note that the conquest
over the plague first--and we&#39;ll be talking next week about smallpox
second--were extraordinary influences, triumphs over the two most feared
diseases of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the first conquest over
infectious disease. And I would say that that wasn&#39;t a million miles away from
being a background influence on the coming of the Age of the Enlightenment. </p>
<p>I would also
speculate that the triumph over plague first, and then smallpox, also played a
role in the coming of the industrial revolution; that the plague and smallpox
had been enormous brakes on demographic growth and the growth of the economy.
And the conquest of the plague by the eighteenth century, followed by victory
over smallpox, had a major impact on launching a great age of European
population growth. And population growth, in turn, was a precondition for the
coming of the Industrial Revolution. Again, note that I&#39;m not saying that the
conquest of plague was a mono-causal explanation for the coming of the
Industrial Revolution. I&#39;m saying simply that it was one of many
pre-conditions; that it was a growing population that provided that endless
supply of free laborers for factories, mines and sweatshops. And it also provided
a growing market for industrial products. Demographic change then supplied a
large home market for industry.</p>
<p>Having made that
argument with regard to plague, next week what I&#39;d like to do is to turn to the
second major epidemic disease. If plague was the greatest feared disease of
the seventeenth century, and from the fourteenth through the seventeenth, in
the eighteenth century the most feared disease was smallpox. And I&#39;d like to
look next at smallpox, its impact, and on the second great development of a
public health measure, a very different one, which was the public health
measure of vaccination. So, that&#39;s where we&#39;re going next. </p>
