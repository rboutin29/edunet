<p><strong>Professor Frank Snowden:</strong> Our topic this morning is influenza, which is timely for today.  And I&#39;d like to begin by talking about influenza virus more in general, and we&#39;ll concentrate our attention, for obvious reasons, on the Spanish Lady, the great influenza of 1918, 1919.  Now, influenza virus was isolated in the 1930s by Andrews, Wilson and Laidlaw, and the mechanisms of the disease were then unraveled subsequently.  As you know, there are three types, A, B and C, and it&#39;s A virus that&#39;s the cause of pandemics among human beings.  </p>
<p>In terms of the
structure of the virus, as you know, it&#39;s RNA, wrapped in a protein envelope,
with protein spikes on the surface--you can see them--and the spikes are of two
major types: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase.  The hemagglutinin enables the
virus to attach itself to a host cell, in this case in the respiratory tract,
and it&#39;s neuraminidase that enables the fusion of the virus with cells, so that
the viral RNA can be released into the cell&#39;s cytoplasm and then migrate to the
cell nucleus.  The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase have various strains that
have been numbered, and you have on your handout those that have been
identified for the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first century.  And
everyone knows now H1N1, the swine virus that&#39;s currently with us.  And I&#39;m
sorry on the handout that I&#39;ve got 2010; I meant to have 2009 to 2011.  So, if
you could make that correction, that would make me feel happy.  </p>
<p>The viral RNA then
hijacks the cell and transforms it into a viral factory for the reproduction of
virus, and it eventually destroys the cell itself.  This process of
reproduction is extraordinarily efficient, and nearly instantaneous, so that
the idea of measuring generations of viruses begins to lose all meaning.  We
also need to point out, about influenza virus, that the RNA combines in all
sorts of ways, making a genetic characteristic of extreme instability, or
should we say mutability.  </p>
<p>The processes
involved, that you can study up on Science Hill in more detail, involve things
called antigen drift, antigen shift, mutation, hybridization, giving rise to
subtypes, strains and variants.  All of these changes are part of the success
story of influenza as a disease, and there is no crossover immunity from one
strain to another; acquired immunity, that is, is strain specific.  Well, mutability
also explains an epidemiological feature of influenza, and that is that
pandemics tend to arrive in waves, each being biologically different, with
different symptoms and different virulence.  And we&#39;ll see that the great
pandemic, after World War I, had four major waves.  </p>
<p>Well, influenza tends
to be reflective of the relationships also of human beings and animals--birds,
horses and pigs--in that there&#39;s interspecies transfer from animals to humans,
and from humans in the reverse direction.  And this may be the route by which
human beings first contracted the disease, and it&#39;s known that this, the animal
reservoir, is a source of new strains.  The hypothesis recently has been that
there&#39;s a reservoir in Asia, perhaps in China or Asiatic Russia.  But
interestingly, it&#39;s that very hypothesis that misled public health responses
when the swine flu pandemic first got underway, in that surveillance was active
in the Far East but the disease arrived instead in Mexico.  </p>
<p>What&#39;s the history of
human beings and influenza?  The origins simply aren&#39;t known.  The earliest
clear evidence, of a literary kind, is in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries.  But records are fragmentary and unreliable.  So, the best we can do
is to look at the last few centuries; the eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth,
and the first years of our own century.  In the eighteenth century, there were major
pandemics: 1729 to &#39;30, &#39;32 to &#39;33, &#39;61 to &#39;62, and then especially 1781 to
1782, and then 1788 to 1789.  In the nineteenth century there were pandemics
1830 to &#39;31, &#39;33, &#39;50 to &#39;51, and then the great pandemic of 1889 to 1890.  And
in the twentieth century we&#39;ve had a number of pandemics, the greatest being
1918 to &#39;20; the Spanish Flu, as it was called.  </p>
<p>Now, the reason I was
reading out the rather grim years of influenza pandemics was to point out
first, of course, that they&#39;re recurrent and are still with us, as you know,
but also to note that there seemed to be something of a pattern of more or less
one major pandemic in every century.  Well, influenza is a viral infection
transmitted person to person; an airborne disease, much more contagious than
say SARS, that we remember from just a few years ago.  SARS requires prolonged
face-to-face contact, but not influenza.  </p>
<p>So, a notable feature
then of the flu is its rapid communicability.  It also has a short incubation
period, just twenty-four to seventy-two hours.  All of that implies also that
epidemiologically it&#39;s different from a number of the infectious diseases we&#39;ve
studied.  As I said in the email that I sent to you about social diseases, it&#39;s
really a spectrum, not an absolute, when we talk about being a social disease
or not.  And I would submit to you that influenza is at the far end of that
spectrum, in not really being a classic social disease.  It&#39;s not very
sensitive to economic conditions, sanitation and diet; those features that were
hallmarks of malaria, say, or tuberculosis.  </p>
<p>Its diffusion occurs
wherever human beings move in numbers and breathe.  It follows networks of
communication: railroads, steamships, airplanes in our time; and ports and
railroad hub cities, or now we would say airport centers, tend to be foci of
infection, and were first attacked with lightening speed.  So, flu was favored
by the transportation technology of the industrial revolution and since, and
once again by urbanization, and of course population growth and overcrowding.  </p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at a
precursor to the great pandemic of the First World War, and this is the
horrible pandemic of the nineteenth century, of 1889 to 1890.  This was the
first truly global pandemic of influenza, and the most devastating one in history,
until that time.  It affected every continent.  The reasons were that the world
was prepared now for pandemic influenza, as a result of the transportation
revolution--the railroad and the steamship--urbanization and trade, demographic
growth and colonialism.  Vulnerability to influenza then seems to be, in part,
a byproduct of modernization, as we&#39;ve been reminded by recent events.  Studies
of 1889 to 1890 demonstrate this in more detail.  </p>
<p>In cities like
Moscow, Paris or London, the first cases occurred in October to November of
1889.  And these tended not to be noticed; there was nothing particular about
them that people noted at the time.  But they occurred among very particular
sectors of the population that were most involved in trade, commerce and the
nodes of communication; that is, the first people to fall ill tended to be
dockers or post-office workers, railway men, policemen.  Furthermore, the less
industrialized the locality, the more remote and agricultural it was, the later
and less severely the locality suffered.  In 1889 to 1890, the Alps in Europe,
Italy, Spain and Portugal, all lagged behind Northern Europe and the United
States, and even in the great urban centers there were isolated, small
communities that sometimes survived entirely unscathed; monasteries and
convents, for example, in both Moscow and Paris experienced the pandemic
without victims, in some cases.  And this was sometimes true also of closed
institutions like prisons.  </p>
<p>Then typically, after
following the transportation network--and this was true of 1889 to &#39;90--the flu
spread along what&#39;s called the urban hierarchy; that is, it went first to major
cities, and from there into the hinterland of those cities, and only later to
smaller towns, villages and rural areas.  And 1918 to &#39;19, in the United
States, shows this same pattern; that is, the flu went almost instantaneously
from Boston and New York to Cincinnati, Chicago, New Orleans, Detroit, San
Francisco, Seattle, and then at greater leisure it moved into almost every place
in between, until there was hardly a settlement of any size that had been
entirely spared.  </p>
<p>Wherever it went,
rich and poor, educated and illiterate, men and women, the physically fit and
the unfit, were similarly infected.  But there were circumstances, certain
ones, that were especially favorable to the disease.  A crowded urban
environment was clearly one, where people were streaming in and out, in closely
packed milieus: schools, theaters, barracks, naval ships, tenement buildings,
college dormitories.  In all the epidemics of influenza, except 1918 to &#39;20,
there was also a strong predilection of the influenza virus for the infants and
the elderly.  There also tended to be an over-representation of people with
pre-existing respiratory diseases--say tuberculosis or bronchitis--or people
with immunosuppressive diseases.  The great example, until the HIV/AIDS era,
was, of course, malaria, and malarial victims were highly susceptible to
influenza.  So, the tubercular and the malarial died massively during influenza
pandemics.  </p>
<p>A typical graph then
of the influenza mortality would show a neat U-shaped curve, spiked at both
ends of the age spectrum of the population, the very young and the elderly.
Another common feature of influenza pandemics was pronounced seasonality.  In
the Northern Hemisphere, influenza almost invariably peaked in the winter
months, November to February, and ended with the coming of warm weather in the
spring.  The reasons for--good epidemiological explanations have to do partly
with human behavior.  People tend to congregate indoors in the winter, often in
buildings and rooms that are poorly ventilated.  The virus itself doesn&#39;t
survive well in an environment where there&#39;s sunlight and high humidity, and
winter is a time when people tend to sneeze and cough more than at other
times.  </p>
<p>What are some other
features of flu pandemics?  One is short duration.  This helps to understand
societal responses as well.  We know that plague and cholera tended to lay
siege to a locality for months, and in the community it felt quite like that.
But flu tended to last just a few weeks, and then to move on.  It was true also
that there was a high morbidity--that is, lots of people would fall ill from
influenza--but there was a low case fatality rate.  The overall mortality would
be large simply because of the large numbers of sufferers.  The kill rate was
low.  In the nineteenth century, influenza, however, killed far more people
than cholera, and a stark contrast then could be drawn.  </p>
<p>Flu seems to be
quintessentially a contagious disease.  But since you&#39;re interested in the
debate between--this is one of your favorites, I&#39;m sure--between
anticontagionism and contagionism, we might point out to you that even although
you think it seems to be self-evident that influenza, the grippe, the flu is
contagious, that many of the, in fact the dominant current, still in the 1890s,
was that influenza was not contagious.  And the eminent British epidemiologist,
Charles Creighton, still held to anticontagionism regarding this disease, down
into the 1890s.  </p>
<p>Well, what sorts of
things held Creighton back from accepting influenza as an infectious disease?  First
he argued the disease would affect most parts of a country in the same two or
three weeks. There simply wasn&#39;t time for a contagious disease to spread with
that extreme rapidity, he thought.  He also thought within a smaller radius it
seemed to affect everyone, say in a household, more or less simultaneously.
Everyone would fall ill at once.  So, it seemed there wasn&#39;t time for
contagion.  And it was this simultaneous, sudden outbreak of influenza that
gave it some of its traditional names.  It was called the grippe; not only in
French, <i>la grippe</i>, but also in English in the nineteenth century it was
referred to as grippe.  And partly that&#39;s because it seemed suddenly to seize
people in its grasp.  </p>
<p>Typically, you could
be healthy at breakfast, only to find yourself suffering with chills, fever,
aching bones and nausea by lunchtime.  Similarly, Moscow seemed, to physicians,
to be healthy on the first of November, 1889, but by the middle of the month
the disease was everywhere.  Shops and schools were closed, commerce nearly
ground to a halt.  And this gave it--was part of the reason it got its other
name, influenza.  This was an Italian word meaning influence, and in this case
people speculated about the influence of some cosmic factor that would disturb
the microcosm as well.  Perhaps it was the influence of the stars or the
heavens that poisoned or corrupted the atmosphere and lay low whole cities all
at once.  </p>
<p>What about symptoms,
effects on the individual?  I think we can be brief, because it&#39;s probably very
familiar to you, from personal experience; that is, seasonal influenza.  The
onset, as we&#39;ve said, is normally sudden.  The symptoms then are ones that you
know: a high fever, 100 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, typically; an unproductive
cough; aching of muscles in the back, the legs; watery eyes; sometimes nausea
and vomiting; general malaise; headache; pain in the joints; sometimes
dizziness; and a general sense of fatigue and weakness.  Typically the acute
phase would last three to five days, and for a few days more you&#39;d suffer from
your cough and from lethargy.  And then, in the vast number of cases, there would
be recovery.  </p>
<p>Flu, for young adults
in good health, enjoyed a reputation as a nasty but mercifully short, and
usually not serious, affliction.  Influenza in the middle of the nineteenth
century--that is, at least before the cataclysm of 1889 and 1890--was--people
joked about it, that it was a disease that was so unimportant that the only
physicians who gave it much attention were those who simply had too few
patients, and so started treating people with flu as a means of enhancing their
income.  On the other hand, for infants, for the elderly and those with chronic
disease, it sometimes led to serious and even fatal complications; and it was
the complications, much more than the flu, that tended to kill.  Patients who
didn&#39;t recover after three or four days then moved on to serious complications
like pneumonia or bronchitis.  And about once a century, a strain of influenza
that was not seasonal but pandemic appeared, and demonstrated that flu can in
fact, under certain conditions, be one of the most deadly of all diseases.  </p>
<p>Well, what about
treatment?  Today, as in the past, there&#39;s no specific remedy for influenza, as
we&#39;ve been reminded by recent events in the newspapers.  The disease is
self-limiting normally, and simply runs its course.  So, therapy is supportive
and symptomatic, rest and nursing care, more than active medical intervention.
In the nineteenth century this was also recognized, and physicians weren&#39;t
inclined to try heroic remedies, as they did say with Asiatic cholera.  But
there were certain attempts at therapeutics in the nineteenth century, and even
after World War I people were given aspirin, cinnamon with milk to lower
temperature, fluids and nourishment, bed rest.  Quinine was administered to
lower the fever.  There were warm baths for hydrotherapy; oxygen sometimes
administered to patients with respiratory complications.  And some physicians
recommended caffeine to raise the flagging animal energy, as it was called.</p>
<p>Today the only actual
therapeutics is antibiotics, but they don&#39;t combat the influenza itself, but
its complication of pneumonia.  Well, against that background, let&#39;s look more
closely at the Spanish influenza--the Spanish Lady, the Spanish grippe, as it
was called--from 1918 to 1920.  Well, first you&#39;ll probably wonder, why this
Spanish association?  And the reason has actually nothing to do with Spain
itself and disease.  It was simply that Spain was not a belligerent in the
First World War, and therefore was free of censorship of the media.  Hence a
free press reported the medical crisis there extensively.  A popular theory in
circulation these days is that perhaps the Spanish Lady originated not in Spain
at all, but in Kansas.  </p>
<p>In any event, on the
morning of--finding the case zero is a perilous art, but let&#39;s say that at
least this much is known--on the morning of the eleventh of March, 1918, at
Fort Riley, the cook, Albert Gitchell, reported sick.  By noon, the camp
infirmary had some 100 cases, and these were the earliest known examples of
this new influenza.  There&#39;s some background that helps us comprehend the
extraordinary case of 1918 to 1920.  As in the past, mutations occurred, and in
this time produced a new strain that turned out to be more virulent than any in
influenza&#39;s history.  Its mode of communication was identical to other flu
pandemics, but its effects on both the individual and society were radically
different.  </p>
<p>So, let&#39;s talk about
this pandemic as coming in four waves.  The first was in the spring of 1918,
and was relatively mild, in March and April.  It soon passed, and it attracted
little attention.  Wartime press censorship was partly a factor, but people
were simply preoccupied with the war and not with the presence of a mild
outbreak of a well-known and common disease.  The second wave was the fall of
1918, which was the worldwide disaster.  It began in August with simultaneous
explosions in places as far apart as Sierra Leone, Boston in this country,
Brest in France; a common feature being that these were all port cities, and
had an important role in the movements of troops and supplies.  In this case,
one could argue that not only the war itself, but also the coming of peace,
contributed to the spread of the flu.  </p>
<p>Armistice Day itself
produced huge crowds and gatherings, which were not propitious for stopping the
spread of the disease.  Then came the spring of 1919, a less, much less,
mercifully less severe wave.  And then finally January, February of 1920, the
fourth wave of the Spanish Lady, which was mild, and limited in its morbidity even.
Partly, of course, because by then so many people were already immune.  Well,
there are a number of features of the Spanish Lady that made her unique.  The
first was that it possessed an extraordinary mortality and morbidity.
Comparing it with normal outbreaks of influenza, it&#39;s impossible to generate
precise statistics.  But there are speculations that this was perhaps, in
absolute terms, the greatest demographic shock that humanity had ever
experienced from infectious diseases.  </p>
<p>More people died of
influenza than of casualties in the First World War.  Worldwide, some
estimates--the estimates vary widely, so one has to take them with great
caution.  But they ranged from 25,000,000 people perishing, upwards to--the
highest estimates are about 100,000,000.  In the United States it&#39;s pretty well
known that at least 675,000 people perished; more than American casualties in
all twentieth-century wars; ten times the numbers killed in First World War.
In a normal--if there is such a thing--influenza outbreak, a case fatality rate
might be something like 0.1 percent.  In the case of the Spanish influenza, the
case fatality rate was just above 2.5 percent, and this yielded a vast total
mortality, because indeed, as it seemed at the time, almost everyone was infected.
</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at a slide
of the death rates.  You can see the influenza, the great wave in October,
November, December of 1918.  The black is 1918--rather, sorry, is the average
1911 to 1917, and the grey is 1918.  So, this compares influenza then with what
we might call normal influenza.  You can see the extraordinary new mortality.
Another feature of this influenza was the lack of understanding of the disease
when it broke out.  Indeed, I&#39;d like to quote Victor Vaughan, who directed
public health in the United States Army against the Spanish Lady.  And he said,
and I&#39;m quoting: &quot;Doctors know no more about the flu than fourteenth-century
Florentines did about the Black Death.&quot;  And I think it&#39;s important to
understand this idea of a sense of helplessness facing this medical
catastrophe.  </p>
<p>Some physicians
indeed, in 1918, termed what they were facing &quot;epidemic pneumonia.&quot;  And then,
as now, there was no effective treatment.  The symptoms were distinctive.  As
you now know from reading Crosby, this influenza was fulminant, and post-mortem
lung examinations revealed things that were unlike anything that examining
physicians had seen before.  Enormous quantities of bloody fluid, like a froth,
filling the lungs.  Some physicians, on their first encounter, suspected that
this was a kind of pneumonic plague.</p>
<p>Right here in New
Haven, in the New Haven Hospital, pathologists wrote that the devastation
caused to the lungs more than anything else resembled the effects of poisonous
gases used in World War I,-like phosgene or chlorine, were the comparisons that
came to their mind.  Furthermore, although other organs of the body could be
affected--the spleen, for example--the impact of the Spanish Lady on the lungs
was so overwhelming that that alone was often the cause of death, and pulmonary
effects were almost the only ones that people noticed.  </p>
<p>Let me read a passage
from Katherine Anne Porter, the famous writer, <i>Pale Horse, Pale Rider</i>,
where she was herself a victim of the influenza.  And she writes here in the third
person, but she&#39;s describing her own symptoms, and I think it&#39;s worth noting
how she felt:  &quot;Silenced, Miranda sank easily through deeps upon deeps of
darkness, until she lay like a stone at the farthest bottom of life, knowing
herself to be blind, deaf, speechless, no longer aware of the members of her
own body, entirely withdrawn from all human concerns, yet alive with a peculiar
lucidity and coherence.  All notions of the mind, the reasonable inquiries of
doubt, all ties of blood and desires of the heart, dissolved and fell away from
her, and there remained only a minute, fiercely burning particle of being that
knew itself alone, that relied upon nothing beyond itself for its strength, not
susceptible to any appeal or inducement, being itself composed entirely of one
single motive, the stubborn will to live.  This fiery, motionless particle set
itself unaided to resist destruction, to survive, and to be in its own madness
of being, motiveless and planless, beyond that one essential end.  She felt, without
warning, a vague tremor of apprehension, some small flick of distrust in her
joy.  A thin frost touched the edges of this confident tranquility.  Something,
somebody was missing.  She&#39;d lost something.  She had left something valuable
in another country.  What could it be?  &#39;There are no trees, no trees here,&#39;
she said in fright.  &#39;I&#39;ve left something unfinished.&#39;  A thought struggled at
the back of her mind, came clearly as a voice in her ear.  &#39;Where are the
dead?  We&#39;ve forgotten the dead.  The dead, where are they?&#39;  At once, as if a
curtain had fallen, the bright landscape faded.  She was alone in a strange
stony place of bitter cold, picking her way along a steep path of slippery
snow, calling out, &#39;Oh I must go back.  But in what direction?&#39;  Pain returned,
a terrible compelling pain, running through her veins like heavy fire.  The
stench of corruption filled her nostrils.  The sweetish, sickening smell of
rotting flesh and pus.  She opened her eyes and saw pale light through a coarse
white cloth over her face, and she knew that the smell of death was in her own
body, and she struggled to lift her hand.&quot;</p>
<p> There are also
pictures of--this is a famous painting of Edvard Munch, <i>After the Influenza,
in 1919</i>.  Or this is also--in fact, this is called <i>After the Flu</i>,
painted in 1919.  A doctor wrote that his patients died, struggling to clear
their airways of a blood-tinged froth that gushed from their noses and mouths.
The fluid then filled the respiratory system, from the trachea to the tiniest
alveoli and bronchioles.  And at post-mortem examination the lungs were greatly
distended, and when pressed, even lightly, oozed with blood-tinged fluid and
yellow pus.  The walls of the alveoli collapsed under the pressure, leaving a
formless mass where neither blood nor air could flow freely, and the patient
died of asphyxia, or the blockage of pulmonary circulation.  </p>
<p>Let me show you two
pictures of the lungs of a young woman who died of the Spanish Lady at the New
Haven Hospital, and I think you can see the enormous and terrifying destruction
of the lungs that occurred.  Well, in addition, there were important sequelae.
One feature of the Spanish Lady was the distinctive length of convalescence.
And also there were neurological aftereffects, protracted depression, and there
is speculation that throughout the 1920s there was an outbreak of neurological
afflictions, that Oliver Sacks deals with in his famous book <i>Awakenings</i>.
There&#39;s some dispute about whether this was an authentic, among authentic
sequelae of the Spanish influenza, but it is at least plausible.  </p>
<p>Another feature that
made this pandemic distinctive was the age profile of the victims.  We&#39;ve seen
how normally in influenza there&#39;s a U-shaped curve.  It does what seems normal
to people, attacking the very young and the elderly.  The Spanish Lady instead
had a preference for adults in the twenty to forty-year age group.  And so it
produced something that seemed highly unnatural, a W-shaped curve, with a spike
in the middle, afflicting the people in the prime of life.  Victor Vaughan
again observed that the Spanish flu imitated the war itself, and that it killed
young adults.  Like war, he said, this infection kills young, vigorous, robust
adults.  The reasons are still mysterious.  But one could point to a couple of
partial factors.  </p>
<p>Perhaps the elderly
had some immunity left over from the great pandemic of 1889 to &#39;90.  And it was
the young, of course, epidemiologically, who most directly experienced the war
and military service, in close, crowded conditions; just the young population,
most at risk.  And for those of you who think that working out at the gym
protects you from influenza pandemics, I would point out that the physically
fit also fell ill in comparable numbers.  John Hellum, the U.S. pentathlon
champion--that is, someone who did the broad jump, discus, javelin, 200-meters
and 1500 meters--died in October 1918 of the flu.  As did Jackie O&#39;Shaughnessy,
who was the U.S. National quarter-mile champion.  So, physical fitness had
nothing to do with survival from the influenza.  </p>
<p>Let me show you a
graph.  This is the notorious U-shaped curve of the influenza.  And you see the
two curves together.  The dotted line is normal influenza, and this solid line,
with the terrible W in the middle, is the mortality from the Spanish Lady.
Well, meanwhile, what happened with public health?  And here a major feature is
to point out--and we should think of this in terms of lessons for preparedness
today--was the way that the public health service was overwhelmed.  It was
overwhelmed in part because of the extreme rapidity with which this disease,
through its airborne transmission, was spread; by the speed of transportation,
and the short incubation period of the disease.  </p>
<p>It was also true that
there is a percentage--perhaps ten percent, in the Spanish Lady--of people who
are asymptomatic carriers.  Influenza also was not a reportable disease.  It
was maximized also because of the unavoidable and uncontrollable movement of
troops, because of the war.  But in addition, there was a lack--and we might
think about this--of preparation for just such an emergency, a shortage of
doctors, nurses, hospital beds and space on hospital wards.  Influenza also has
the terrible feature, unlike cholera for example, that it creates chaos within
the health system itself, by striking down caregivers who are among those who
are most vulnerable.  And then there was the war itself, in which doctors and
nurses were mobilized to deal with the victims of the conflict.  </p>
<p>So, there were drastic
shortages of healthcare personnel available to the civilian population.  Rupert
Blue, whom you will remember from the Barbary Plague, was a director of public
health services during the crisis, and he was forced to lure doctors and nurses
out of retirement, to help deal with the emergency; to recruit even from
old-age homes.  Well, what were the measures adopted to deal with the crisis?
Anti-flu measures, by this time, were based on the premise that this was a
contagious disease, and the understanding that influenza was spread somehow
through the air.  A first major goal was to prevent those who were healthy from
inhaling the contaminated air of the infected.  To that end, public gatherings
and assemblies of large numbers of people at close quarters were banned.
Public institutions were closed: schools, dancehalls, movie theaters, bars.
Churches in this country were allowed to remain open, but the number of
services was greatly reduced.  </p>
<p>In many cities,
people seen by the police to be coughing and sneezing, without covering their
faces, were stopped and fined.  The New York City Department of Health posted
some 10,000 placards around the city, bearing a message that was familiar to
the public, because of its similarity to the urgings of the campaign against
tuberculosis.  So, one can see the anti-tuberculosis campaign preparing people,
in a sense, for dealing with influenza.  And in New York City the placards
said: to prevent the spread of Spanish influenza, sneeze, cough or expectorate,
if you absolutely must, into your own handkerchief; you&#39;re in no danger if
everyone should heed this warning.  </p>
<p>Another widespread
measure was a practical application also.  One was masking with gauze masks,
and some municipalities required their whole populations to put on masks.  San
Francisco did so, and so did San Diego.  Another was disinfection practices,
applied in hospital wards, sickrooms and ambulances.  Trains too were washed
down with antiseptic solutions.  You can see a picture of the properly masked
police. I think this is San Francisco.  And here you can see the general
masking of the whole population.  And this was a public notice, a public health
poster from Kingston, New York or--and it says about the measures I&#39;ve told you
about; theaters, churches, schools, hospitals, and so forth.  Or you can see
here another poster for public health.  </p>
<p>State boards of
health also isolated the ill through quarantine, as far as possible, and the
military tried to quarantine its training camps.  On hospital wards, sheets were
hung between beds.  Ambulance trains were washed down with antiseptic.  People
were urged to avoid nervous and physical exhaustion.  You can see a long legacy
of this idea.  You remember Laennec talking about the <i>passions tristes</i>,
the sad passions, and their influence on your constitution.  So, some of the
advice had a really long history that you&#39;ll recognize.  And they also
cautioned you to avoid chills.  They urged people to gargle with warm water and
salt, and to spray saline solutions up their nose, to wear gauze masks.  And
legislation was passed to prevent the use of common drinking cups.  Some people
sprayed their nostrils with carbolic acid spray, and some towns set up fines to
punish people they called--this was one of the jargons at the time--the
open-face sneezer.  </p>
<p>New York City
modified the opening hours of stores and businesses in order to stagger rush
hour, so that subway trains and trams would not be so crowded and not be so
dangerous.  Congress voted special funds to enable Surgeon General Rupert Blue
to recruit thousands of doctors and hundreds of nurses.  But, as I said, the
war effort complicated his task, and he turned to people who&#39;d retired.  And
those were other--I wanted to show you a camp.  The fact that it was wartime
made it easy for the government to induce people to accept rigorous measures.
People by this time had grown used, by 1918, to invasive and restrictive
measures.  They already knew all about the draft, or rationing, or daylight
savings time.  But existing facilities were inadequate to cope with a sudden
surge, and so the general public, one can see, suffering as a result of that.  </p>
<p>I wanted to mention
that there were also popular remedies that people adapted, and especially in
rural areas, recourse to folk remedies and magic.  Onion soup was thought to be
a preventative.  People stuffed salt up their nostrils to ward off danger.
They wore garlic around their neck, as they had in Florence in the time of
bubonic plague.  They burned hot charcoals with sulfur or brown sugar, to give
off a reassuring protective aroma; you can recognize this too from the plague.
There were rumors that the disease perhaps was an act of bio-terror.  There
were thoughts that there were mysterious German agents who landed on U-boats
and started the epidemic.  There were suspicious too that poisonous gases
associated with the war effort had escaped and caused the disaster.</p>
<p>Well, I will run out
of time now, and just say that one of the things to think about then are what
are possible lessons?  And I just wanted to leave us to think, as we deal with
our own H1N1, and possibly whatever its successor is, that clearly in 1918 and
&#39;19, there&#39;s a collective memory in the public health service of the
vulnerability of a society of critically ill patients, turned away from
hospitals, that were full to bursting, with no care available because the
system was overwhelmed.  And there&#39;s a fear then of what about the effects now
of the impact of organized care medicine, on a managed care basis, with
cost-cutting search for savings in our system; the commitment to ridding
hospitals of excess capacity and spare beds.  And so this approach raises the
question of what would happen in another time when the system might once again
be tested? </p>
