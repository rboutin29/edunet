<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden: </b>Without
more ado, then, we&#39;ll turn to our topic of the morning, which is about the
first embodiment of a rational scientific medicine, which is rather an
extraordinary one because it lasts from the fifth century B.C. down to the
nineteenth century as a dominant--not exclusive--but a dominant medical
scientific paradigm. It was associated with this idea of the first form of a
rational, secular, naturalistic form of medicine, with ancient Greece in the
fifth century, and in particular with the so-called father of medicine,
Hippocrates, who lived from about 460 to 377 B.C. Now, there&#39;s some debate
about whether he was one person or a school, a group, of people. There is a
corpus of Hippocratic writings that consists of about sixty works, perhaps by
multiple hands. But that issue won&#39;t really concern us. </p>
<p>We&#39;re concerned with
Hippocrates as either this composite or single figure, and with the various schools
that followed in his name. The sixty works, some of them are very famous to
you already. You know about the Hippocratic Oath. We&#39;ll be talking about such
other works as <i>On the Sacred Disease</i>, <i>On Human Nature</i>, <i>Epidemics</i>,
<i>On Airs, Waters, Places</i>; and he also had a collection of aphorisms. One
would note the variety of the Hippocratic corpus. It consists of a whole
series of things. He/they invented case histories, and they&#39;re included.
There are lecture notes. There are memoranda of all sorts; writings on every
form of medical practice at the time: surgery, obstetrics, diet, the
environment, therapeutics. All of that forms part of the Hippocratic corpus.
So, enormous variety. </p>
<p>In terms of what
Hippocrates accomplished, I&#39;d like to make a contrast, and that is with the
supernatural view of disease. And the first form we could think of that, in
drawing our contrast--the contrast to what Hippocrates accomplished--we can see
it in terms of the breakthrough from something that preceded it and went alongside
it, down to our own day, and this would be first of all the supernatural view
of disease; that epidemics and pestilence are divine punishment sent by an
angry god for sin and disobedience. You can see this in many parts of our
culture. It&#39;s embodied in the Bible, for example. In Genesis, you know that
Adam and Eve lived happily and enjoyed eternal life in the Garden of Eden,
until they committed the sin of eating of the forbidden tree of the fruit of
knowledge of good and evil, and as a result this was original sin and they were
kicked out of the Garden of Eden. From then on for things they had to work.
They also became subject to disease and to death. They were immortal until
that time. </p>
<p>So, we see in Genesis
the embodiment of this idea that diseases are a punishment of sin. This was
also clear--you can read further in the Bible, in the book of Exodus, where you
learn about the bondage of the Israelites in Egypt and God asking for Moses and
Aaron for the Pharaoh to release his chosen people. But the Pharaoh&#39;s heart
was hardened and so the Egyptians were punished with this series of terrible
plagues that are all in Exodus. Another way of embodiment of this was in Psalm
91, and this is of particular importance to us--let&#39;s move to share this with
you. This is the text of Psalm 91. This is particularly important because it
embodies the idea of plague and pestilence as a punishment by God. But also in
terms of our historical experience, as you&#39;re reading Daniel Defoe, you&#39;ll
realize that it&#39;s Psalm 91 that was read out from the Christian churches during
times of epidemic. </p>
<p>This was the great plague
psalm. It embodies hope and an interpretation of what the experience of plague
was all about. Let me read part of it here. &quot;Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day, nor for the
pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor for the destruction that wasteth at
noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right
hand, but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shall thou behold
and see the reward of the wicked. Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my
refuge, even the most high by habitation. There shall no evil befall thee;
neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.&quot; So, if you renounce
sin, the pestilence won&#39;t come near you. </p>
<p>Let me turn also to
another embodiment in culture, our Western culture, and this is the opening
scene of Homer&#39;s <i>Iliad</i>, which as you know is all about the Trojan War,
and it begins just before this scene with Achilles&#39; anger. That is to say,
Achilles was the greatest of the Greek warriors, but the Greek King Agamemnon
had taken his concubine for his own, and as a result, enraged, Achilles
withdrew from combat and sulked in his tent. Now, he had a friend who was a
priest of the god Apollo, and this friend tried to intervene and beseeched
Agamemnon to write the wrong and return the woman. But Agamemnon rebuffed
Apollo&#39;s priest; or as we might say, he dissed him. And, so, what we have here
is this tremendous and terrifying scene at the beginning of the <i>Iliad</i>. Let
me just quote from the beginning then. </p>
<p>&quot;Over and over
the old man [that is, the priest] prayed as he walked in solitude to King
Apollo. &#39;Hear me Lord of the silver bow; bring to pass this wish I pray for.
Let your arrows make the Danaans pay for my tears shed.&#39; So he spoke in
prayer, and Phoebus Apollo heard him, and strode down along the pinnacles of
Olympus, angered in his heart, carrying across his shoulders the bow and the
hooded quiver, and the shafts clashed on the shoulders of the god, walking
angrily. He came as night comes down, and knelt then apart and opposite the
ships, and let go an arrow. Terrible was the clash from the bow of silver.
First he went after the mules and the circling hounds, then let go a tearing
arrow against the men themselves and struck them. The corpse fires burned
everywhere and did not stop burning.&quot; </p>
<p>So, that was Apollo
punishing the Greeks on behalf of his priest. Or let me also mention
something, an example, that&#39;s more recent and closer to home; that is, I want
to talk for a minute about a Yalie. And this is our friend here John Humphrey
Noyes of the nineteenth century, who was at the Yale Divinity School, and he
read the pieces we&#39;ve just talked about, and thought about disease as a
punishment for sin, and decided well there was a remedy. And, so, in all
modesty he and a group of his friends decided that they were going to renounce
sin all together, and they called themselves The Perfectionists. And they
founded an ideal community, first in Putney, Vermont, and then in Oneida in New
York State--it&#39;s part of the history of American utopian communities--in which
they renounced sin and were going to live together in harmony and peace, forever,
as eternal people. And every morning began with a mutual criticism in which
they pointed out each other&#39;s faults--this must have been a lot of fun--in
order that they not fall by the wayside and lapse once again into sin. </p>
<p>Well, I&#39;m sorry to
tell you--this was the 1840s--by the 1890s the ideal community had become
instead a joint stock company, and you still have Oneida pottery and
silverware. And I&#39;m very sorry to report that all of the members of the
community have been buried. I don&#39;t know if that was because they couldn&#39;t
stick the pace, or if the concept was wrong from the outset. In any case, this
was an embodiment, then, of the idea of disease as a punishment for sin. But
if we view this view of pestilence as divine punishment, it does at least imply
a law-governed cosmos. Disease exists for an intelligible reason, and it
implies a rational therapeutics, which is repentance: propitiation of God,
amendment of conduct, and renewed obedience to the laws. </p>
<p>There&#39;s another
variation of a supernatural view, which is more capricious, and let&#39;s call that
the demonic theory of disease. This postulates that the world is populated by
powerful arbitrary and evil spirits who cause disease through their malign
influence. These may be evil persons, such as witches or poisoners, the
disembodied spirits of the dead, superhuman beings, or the devil himself.
We&#39;ll see this view throughout the course, the idea that epidemic diseases are
diabolical plots, not natural events. There&#39;s some occult secret crime caused
by the poisoning of witches or scapegoats, and this gives rise to witch-hunts,
to hunt down and punish the guilty. We know this famously in the seventeenth
century and in our own country at Salem. But the idea was clearly expressed in
Europe by Martin Luther who declared, &quot;I would have no pity on the
witches. I would burn them all.&quot; </p>
<p>Alternatively--that
was a good therapeutic idea--alternatively a person could be deemed to be
inhabited or possessed by an evil spirit, and in that case the cure was to cast
out the devil through exorcism. And this cosmology survives in our own
language when we talk today about someone acting &quot;like someone possessed,&quot; or &quot;out
of his mind.&quot; And healers pursuing these sorts of ideas would invoke magic, or
have incantations. They&#39;d prescribe special concoctions, chants, sacred rites
and spells. And in European history, a relatively recent illustration of that
idea was the idea of the healing power of the royal touch. Charles II of
England, for example, administered this treatment in the seventeenth century to
about 100,000 people. So, healers could do that. They could also recommend
magic practices, offerings and sacrifices; magic charms to ward off the evil
spell; or they could recommend escaping by taking flight; or invoking the power
of a powerful ally, as in the Christian cult of saints that we&#39;ll be talking
about later. </p>
<p>So, if you hold that
up--those two views, then, of supernatural interpretations of disease--then you
can understand the breakthrough that was made in fifth century Greece. This
was in contrast to the supernatural divine and demonic theories, and it&#39;s in
contrast to them that we can see the importance of a new idea; the idea that
disease instead is a naturalistic event that can be understood by natural
causes. Examples of this new, naturalistic, secular view abounded in the fifth
century. You can see it in Thucydides, in his account of the Peloponnesian
War, the famous Plague of Athens that may have been typhus, or more recently it
was thought to have been typhoid. But in any case it was a natural event, and
is described as such by Thucydides, with no reference to the occult or the
supernatural. You can see it in Hippocrates&#39; discussion on epidemics in which
diseases, epidemic diseases, are caused by a corruption of the air. </p>
<p>But let me talk about
this very famous example, and dramatic one, of Hippocrates, <i>On the Sacred
Disease</i>. By the sacred disease he meant epilepsy, and it looks--I guess if
you wanted any disease--it looks like a possession by a demon. It is
epilepsy. And Hippocrates wants to tell us that this is not a supernatural
event, or a possession. He says instead something extremely different. What
he tells us is that: &quot;It is thus with regard to the disease called sacred.
It appears to me to be no wise more divine or sacred than other diseases, but
has a natural cause, like other afflictions. Men regard its nature and cause
as divine, from ignorance and wonder. And this notion of its divinity is kept
up by their inability to comprehend it. Neither truly do I count it as a
worthy opinion to hold that the body of man is polluted by God; the most impure
by the most holy. For were the body defiled, it would be likely to be purified
and sanctified, rather than polluted. Those who first referred this malady to
the gods appear to me to have been just such persons as the conjurers,
mountebanks and charlatans are. Such persons then, using the divinity as a
pretext and screen for their own inability to afford assistance, have given out
that the disease is sacred.&quot; </p>
<p>This was a very major
breakthrough conceptually, the beginning of the foundation of a scientific
medicine. So, therapeutics then got rid, in a naturalistic view, of chance,
potions, spells and sacrifices; and exorcism, appeasement of the gods. The
importance of this momentous step in human consciousness was expressed by a
Yale professor of epidemiology in the 1940s, Charles-Edward Winslow, who
wrote--and let me quote a sentence or two from him. &quot;If disease is postulated
as caused by gods, daemons or demons, scientific progress is impossible. If it
is attributed to hypothetical humors, the theory can be tested and improved.
The conception of natural causation was the essential first step. It marks
incomparably the most epochal advance in the intellectual history of
mankind.&quot; That perhaps is putting it a little strongly, but you certainly
get the point. </p>
<p>Now, why perhaps was
there a rational scientific medicine in fifth century Greece? Here I think the
main part of the answer has to be imponderable factors such as the inspiration
of Hippocrates himself, and his associates. But there were influences we could
point to as important: The absence of a priestly bureaucracy, with the power to
sanction heretics; the centralized city states; the legacy of Greek natural
philosophy, the work of Plato and Aristotle in particular; a culture of
individualism. And I think we also need to remember the Hippocratics&#39;
positions. Although they were known to treat the poor and slaves, their care
was not by and large available to the masses. The primary clientele consisted
of educated, prosperous elites in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, and this was
a medical philosophy that suited them. The educated doctor and the educated
patient spoke the same language, and the therapies that the physician proposed,
such as a special diet or rest, were remedies the wealthy could afford. </p>
<p>We should say that
Hippocratic medicine is still with us. We can see it in the return to holistic
medicine. We can see it also in the Muslim world, and you can still be treated
in Unani medicine by a Hippocratic style medicine. And you can see it in
certain popular cultural precepts, such as &quot;feed a cold and starve a fever.&quot;
Well, if that&#39;s its importance, let&#39;s look at its content. What was the content
of this first embodiment of scientific medicine? And it was humoralism. Here
let&#39;s talk about what that is. The fundamental assumption was that there&#39;s a
correspondence between the macrocosm of the universe and the microcosm of the
individual body. Both are composed of the same materials, subject to the same
laws, and disorder can occur in one and be followed by disease in the body. </p>
<p>According to
Aristotle and natural philosophy, the macrocosm consisted of four elements that
you can see here. They were earth, water, air and fire. And each of the
elements is associated with four qualities, which can be dry and hot like fire;
or dry and cold; or cold and wet; or wet and hot. So, the elements embody also
four qualities, in different proportions, of course. And this went on over the
centuries, and there were four seasons, four winds, later on four evangelists. </p>
<p>The point for us is
there was also a microcosm, and one can see the theory expounded on human
nature in which there are four humors, which are phlegm, black bile, yellow
bile and blood. And each of those--also the body is composed of these--and
each has qualities of as being wet and cold, or hot and dry. This also
determines--the balance of these humors in the body--the four temperaments:
whether you&#39;re melancholic, phlegmatic, choleric or sanguine. Those words
survive in our culture. There are four ages of man, four principal organs of
the body: the spleen, the brain, the liver and heart. You see the importance
of four. And the system is axiomatic. It&#39;s based on deductive reasoning from
first principles. Central, of course, to all of it was the climate of Greece,
with its seasonal patterns and its specific patient population. Many were
malarial victims with the complications of pneumonia. And Hippocrates, indeed,
was the world&#39;s first malariologist. </p>
<p>Now, health
consisted--was called eucrasia, which meant a balance or equilibrium of the
humors, and therefore the qualities. And variations are possible, up to a
certain threshold, and at various times in your life--or from one person to
another--the balance among the four humors can change. But once you cross a
certain threshold in variation--that is, one humor becomes overly dominant, or
one humor is lacking in sufficient supply--that&#39;s an imbalance. That&#39;s
dyscrasia; an excess or deficiency of one of the humors, and that is disease.
So, we know what disease is then. It&#39;s an imbalance of the humors. Note that
there is no single--that is to say there aren&#39;t discrete individual diseases,
as in modern medicine; that is, disease is classified as typhoid, cancer,
pneumonia, and all the rest. Disease instead was a holistic phenomenon of body
equilibrium. There was, in a sense, only one disease. </p>
<p>Now, what were the
causes? The causes were said to be, what we might call in modern jargon,
environmental insults; that Galen later on was to codify as the six
non-naturals. The human body and constitution then had contact with the air,
which might be corrupted, or &quot;miasmatic,&quot; as it was called later. Motion, or
what we might call exercise, was the second--or its lack--non-natural. Sleep
or wakefulness; excretion or retention of whatever was ingested; and the
passions of the soul, these were the non-naturals that could tip the body into
disease. Restoring health was based in part on nature itself; that is to say,
there&#39;s a teleology of the body, embodied in the phrase <i>v</i><i>is medicatrix naturae</i>; which is the
healing power of nature. And the means to restore--the body, in other words,
strives to restore equilibrium, through its innate heat or through the
elimination of excess humors, when you sweat, you sneeze or you vomit; for all
of that is your body&#39;s attempt to get rid of the humor that&#39;s making you sick because
of its excess. So, this led then to humoral therapeutics. And let&#39;s talk
about that. </p>
<p>The basis of medical
strategy was that the physician was the ally of nature, and of the body. The
body was trying to restore itself to health, and the physician would join it in
doing battle against disease. He would read the signs to decipher the
underlying process; would take a case history; would practice close
observation, taking the pulse, listening to the body; and would examine the
urine, its color, its density. He would smell it and taste it, and see whether
it contained blood or was frothy, as all of those were worrying prognostic
signs. It was a holistic treatment where you didn&#39;t treat individual symptoms,
but the whole constitution. And it also had an idea of the individualism of
the patient. Treatment should be tailored to the constitution of the
individual. There are no disease entities, because disease is not a thing but
a process. </p>
<p>This was a medicine
that was rather indifferent to diagnosis or classification. What it stressed
instead was the answer to the patient&#39;s eternal question, &quot;Am I going to
be all right doc?&quot; Prognosis was what really mattered to the Hippocratic
physician. The therapeutic principle was that opposites treat opposites. So,
if you have an excess of a dry and cold humor, like a black bile, if that&#39;s the
humor that&#39;s causing your illness, then you would like perhaps to give the
patient a food to ingest that would be wet and hot; and hot in this case, think
of it not simply as the touch. We think of it when we talk about spicy food as
being hot. All the elements that you have also have qualities, and so diet is
very important to this therapeutics. </p>
<p>The tools available
to the physician, then, are first of all diet. In some sense the Hippocratic
physicians thought we are what we eat, and all foodstuffs had qualities--hot,
cold, moist, dry--to balance an opposite defect or excess in the human body.
Exercise was also important. A change of environment; in modern terms, going
to a spa or a sanatorium. Moderation in the emotions, moderation in sex. And
medication was important, because they did practice, Hippocratic physicians,
internal medicine. Examples were to promote evacuation by providing emetics,
sudorifics, purgatives or diuretics. And most important perhaps was a primacy
of venesection--by which I mean bloodletting or phlebotomy--that became the
hallmark of the orthodox physician.</p>
<p>Medicine, in other
words, was conceived as a process of addition and subtraction, adding what is
wanting and subtracting what is in excess. Now, you may have your doubts about
venesection. Let me just mention some of its advantages in the eyes of
Hippocratic physicians. It was systematic, like disease itself. Its effects
were immediate and you could control them. It was speedy. Its limits were
also self-evident to the experienced doctor. Perhaps the patient fainted, the
pulse disappeared, or the color of the blood altered. There were however, of
course, contraindications to bloodletting: old age and efficiency of blood; the
summer heat; evacuation already occurring by other means; or extreme cold. So,
the lancet, the instrument for bloodletting--there we have real lancets--became
the symbol of the orthodox physician, down through the nineteenth century. </p>
<p>Now, note that there
is no real humoral physiology, no idea of the circulation of the blood. The
heart is not a pump but a furnace, drawing air from the lungs, heating it and
distributing it as innate heat in the body. So, this was the first embodiment
of scientific medicine. I want to talk about an alteration that it went
through, through the second father of medicine. And this is another Greek
physician, who lived however in ancient Rome, and that is Galen. And that&#39;s a
picture. Now, his personal--he lived in the second century A.D., from 130 to
about 201, with his formative years being lived out in Rome. His personal
qualities are important. He was very different from Hippocrates.</p>
<p>Hippocrates was a
great observer, an empiricist. Galen instead prided himself above all on his
knowledge of the texts of Hippocrates. He almost worshipped Hippocrates, but
regarded himself as the authorized interpreter of Hippocratic works, which he
turned into a dogma. Now, in Rome, Galen was physician to the gladiators. His
personal position helps explain his influence. He then became private doctor
to the emperor. And he regarded himself as the ideal physician, philosopher
and scientist. He was a man of over-weaning self-confidence, who had nothing
but withering scorn for his opponents and colleagues, whom he called
&quot;murderers, amateurs, unversed in Hippocratic wisdom.&quot; He called them
&quot;more ignorant than animals.&quot; </p>
<p>It was true also that
Galen had an encyclopedic knowledge, and we can only understand his influence
if we remember that he was a man of immense knowledge of all branches of the
medicine that existed at his time. And only half of his written works survive,
but they alone fill twelve volumes of about a thousand pages each. In other
words, he was extraordinary in his productivity, and that too is important on
his influence. Now, Galen had a view that was foreign to us of the meaning of
scientific progress. To him Hippocrates was the permanent foundation of
medical science, and the main tenets of that science could never be overturned
or revised. Instead, there was no room in his thinking for scientific
revolutions. The writings of Hippocrates were valid forever. They could only
be completed and perfected. And, in fact, that was Galen&#39;s view of himself.
He was the person who perfected Hippocratic ideas. So, in fact, further
progress was probably unnecessary and perhaps impossible. </p>
<p>So, Galen became the
authoritative interpreter of Hippocrates. This is what we might call Galenism.
And in his hands, Hippocrates became a cult figure, an object of veneration and
almost worship. Hippocrates, about whom so little was known in his personal
life, was now endowed with all manner of apocryphal virtues. He was idealized
as a model of wisdom, courage, temperance, humanity and honesty. Mythologies
developed about his religious piety, his heroism and his hard work. There was
a legend that he was descended, on his father&#39;s side, from the god Asclepius,
and on the maternal side from Hercules. He was said to be a great patriot who
saved Athens from the plague, a man who scorned money and was perfectly wise
and perfectly just. So, he became one of the greatest cultural figures of
antiquity, an equivalent, in a different way, of Socrates, Plato and
Aristotle. </p>
<p>Now, probably some of
you are wondering--we&#39;ve talked about humoralism and its advocates, and you
want to know, &quot;well, that&#39;s all very fine; did it work?&quot; I&#39;d like to say that
humoralism had a number of strengths. It was a quantum leap from magical
thinking to naturalistic explanations of disease. It appealed because it was
accessible to educated laymen. Contemporaries with an education understood
everything that Hippocratic and Galenic doctors said and prescribed. It was
consonant with contemporary understandings. We also need to know that
Hippocratic and Galenic physicians practiced therapeutic modesty. They did not
participate in surgery except, for example, for setting bones, lancing
abscesses and practicing venesection; but the internal cavities of the body
they knew were off limits. It was based on observation. They took case
histories. </p>
<p>And we ought to
remember, in terms of medical effectiveness, that--my wife, for example, who is
a primary care physician, says that about seventy-five percent of patients who
present themselves in a clinic have self-limiting illnesses, or psychosomatic
ones, and mostly need reassurance that everything will be all right. So, the
point about Hippocratic medicine was that experienced physicians, accustomed to
seeing ill people, would be pretty good at prognosis and reassurance. They
would refuse to treat cases they regarded as hopeless, and hopeless cases, they
also had a referral system--we&#39;ll refer to in a minute--which was to temples. I&#39;ll
come back to that in just a second. There were, however, a number of
weaknesses. </p>
<p>So,
Hippocratic/Galenic medicine had a number of powerful strengths. It provided a
lot in terms of reassurance and prognosis, and the answer to that eternal
question, &quot;Will I be all right doc?&quot; and the other question,
&quot;What can I do to help myself?&quot; There were a number of weaknesses.
It was a closed system. It was based on deductive reasoning, and came to be
bound up in the authority of the ancients, with empiricism fading away; and
indeed in later centuries it comes to be called &quot;library medicine.&quot; It was
anchored in a cult of personality--the cult of Galen, and through him of
Hippocrates--and practiced a cult of antiquity, with knowledge almost becoming
a form of revealed truth. So, Galenism involved authority and tradition, an
elite medicine of university-trained physicians who were involved, particularly
in their training, in studying the classics. How do you train a physician?
You have them read Hippocrates and Galen, in the original languages. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to say,
however, that there were no challenges. It&#39;s extraordinary to reflect that
humoralism, as a dominant medical philosophy, persists into the nineteenth
century. But I don&#39;t want to think that it was unchallenged. We know there
were demonic and religious views that ran alongside. But in addition, there
were a series of scientific challenges that occurred in a number of major
shocks to the system that slowly weakened its hold and gave rise to doubters,
but did not thoroughly dismantle humoralism until the late nineteenth century;
and even then it persists in popular culture and some forms of alternative
medicine. What were some of these challenges? I don&#39;t expect you to remember
these at this point; we&#39;ll come back to them later in the course. But just so
that you&#39;ll understand that it wasn&#39;t as though this system never had
challenges. </p>
<p>Protestantism was a
challenge, with a challenge to authority and established texts. And
Paracelsus, whose dates are on your handout, was called the Martin Luther of medicine,
who rejected Galenic and Hippocratic medicine all together. William Harvey
discovered the circulation of the blood, which overthrew or challenged Galen&#39;s
anatomy and his physiology, which were proved not to correspond to the observed
results of dissection and pathology. So, the discovery of the circulation of
the blood was a major blow; although, oddly enough Harvey himself never
rejected humoralism, Hippocrates and Galen. </p>
<p>Then there was the
scientific revolution. And in particular one can think of the chemical
revolution associated with men like Joseph Priestly and Antoine Lavoisier.
They destroyed the Aristotelian notion of elements. Earth and air, for
example, were found themselves to be composed of a great number of modern
elements that go to make up what we know as the periodic table. And more
generally, the scientific revolution marked a democratic turn from authority to
empirical evidence, and it envisioned scientific and medical knowledge as
infinitely expandable and not bounded by set texts. And then, from the point
of view of our course, the experience of epidemic disease, as we&#39;ll see, made
the idea of dyscrasia improbable as a mechanism needed to explain epidemic
disease, because it&#39;s fairly flimsy as a basis for explaining why so many
people, in a single place, at a single moment of time, had their equilibria all
unbalanced at the same moment. </p>
<p>So, the experience of
epidemic disease is important, and we&#39;ll see the physician, Fracastoro, came up
with the idea of contagionism many centuries ago. In the nineteenth century
we&#39;ll see also, with the development of pathology, the idea of disease
specificity; and finally in the late nineteenth century the germ theory of
disease, which offers an entirely different paradigm for disease. So, that&#39;s
the journey we&#39;ll be taking, to the time when humoralism is replaced, and we&#39;ll
look at various embodiments along the way of what people considered to be
scientific medicine. But here a number of you will be thinking that I&#39;ve
involved myself in an important contradiction, and you&#39;ll be thinking about
Asclepius and the fact that I talked about temples and a god. And in
particular let&#39;s look at--that&#39;s the god Asclepius, and this is the--I&#39;ll talk
about who he is. </p>
<p>Hippocrates and Galen
were both pious and devout; that is to say, although they believed in a
naturalistic medicine, it wasn&#39;t that they didn&#39;t also believe in the gods, and
through the gods they found in temple medicine what we might call the world&#39;s
first referral system. Asclepius, who was he? He was first a moral hero who
became half human and half divine, and then entirely a god. He was thought to
be the kindest of the gods; the one who loved humanity enough to sacrifice himself
for their sake. His father was the god Apollo. His daughters were
interestingly named the goddesses Panacea and Hygieia. And physicians in the
ancient world might call themselves Asclepiads, meaning the sons of Asclepius,
who regarded their father as a patron saint. </p>
<p>By the time of
Alexander the Great, Greece possessed three to four hundred temples dedicated
to Asclepius. Asclepius was said to have been killed by Zeus because he taught
mortals the art of healing and Zeus feared that men and women would compete
with him in no longer being subject to death. But Asclepius never practiced
magic. He was merely the most skilled of physicians, using the same principles
that Asclepiads, like Hippocrates and Galen, would use as well. Note, of
course, there are similarities to the story of Christ, and Asclepius was in
fact a major competitor with Christianity for a number of centuries. And like
Christ, after death he was said to have risen and to be present eternally in
the temples. So, the temples were shrines to Asclepius, at places like
Athens. </p>
<p>I&#39;ll show you, I
hope, a couple of examples. That&#39;s Chios, where Hippocrates was from, and this
is the temple at Pergamon. I just want to--there, it&#39;s a whole--this is more
than just a temple, although it is a temple. It&#39;s almost a compound. Now, the
usefulness of identifying yourself with Asclepius was that there was--it
provided physicians with a badge of identity, a source of authority. They were
wandering peripatetic healers, but now they&#39;re recognizable as members of the
same guild. This gave them a collective presence and authority, and Asclepius
also vouched for their ethical conduct. Remember, these are peripatetic
physicians whom you invite into your home. And, so, they needed to have
someone vouch for them, and he vouches that they&#39;re good doctors and that they
have special care for the poor who can&#39;t pay him. But again, there is no
contradiction with naturalistic medicine. </p>
<p>The temples were
precursors, in a way, to health spas, sanatoria or hospitals. There they
provided care for the poor and the seriously ill. Patients could enter them,
the precincts of these compounds, after a period of preparation in which they
bathed, fasted, prayed and offered sacrifice. But the therapeutic strategy comes
to them in a particular way, which is called an &quot;incubation&quot;; which
is to say that at night, after you&#39;ve prepared yourself carefully, in the way I
just mentioned, when you--then the priest will help you--and when you fall
asleep at night you&#39;ll have a dream. This is the incubation, and the god
Asclepius will appear to you and tell you the strategy you should pursue in
order to become well again. But the strategy was nothing other than what a
skilled physician would have prescribed, had he been skillful and wise enough
to have known. </p>
<p>There was never a
treatment prescribed by Asclepius by magical means or miracles, or by practices
that weren&#39;t accessible to the ordinary doctor. So, this is humoral medicine,
the first embodiment of scientific medicine. And I want us to look, for the
next several sessions, at the way in which it was used as a lens to view the
experience of terrible epidemic catastrophes. And we&#39;ll look also at the way
in which the experience of bubonic plague and other epidemics challenged or
raised major questions about humoral theory, and helped propel the scientific
medical elite towards a different view of disease and what it was. So, we&#39;ll
see epidemics, beginning next time, as a process. And we&#39;ll also want then to
explain it, and we&#39;ll look at bubonic plague as the first of our major
epidemics in our course. </p>
