<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Last time, as you&#39;ll remember, we talked about a general overview of the three
pandemics, as well as the impact of the plague bacterium--which we have here, <i>Yersinia
pestis</i>, the star of our show--on the individual human body.  This morning
I&#39;d like to talk about community responses to bubonic plague, first in terms of
unorganized, spontaneous responses.  And then I&#39;d like to look at something
really decisive, which was organized community responses; that is, the first
form of successful public health ever devised, and the first victory over a
human disease, over bubonic plague.  So, that&#39;s where we&#39;re headed this
morning.  </p>
<p>And just so you&#39;ll
remember, plague is not a disease entirely of the past.  The third pandemic
reached these shores, and I wanted to remind you that plague is still with us.
These are the areas in the United States where plague, at the present day, is
endemic among wild rodents, and it causes every year a small trickle of cases
of bubonic plague, usually in the southwest of the United States.  Well, in
terms of community responses, probably the first and most spontaneous of all
was flight.  Panic and fear of sudden death led people to depart in haste.  As
Defoe makes clear, those who were the first to flee were people of means, and
those often included the authorities, and physicians themselves, and clergymen,
thereby increasing disruption and chaos, and magnifying the sense of terror.  </p>
<p>I imagine you
could--for an equivalent, if you were to wake up tomorrow morning and hear that
there was something terrible on the medical front happening in New Haven, and
that DeStefano and Rick Levin had taken the last train out, I can imagine some
of the responses that you might have.  In any case, let&#39;s remember the
atmosphere in a city visited by the plague.  Last time you heard a description
of Florence in 1348, provided by Boccaccio, and you&#39;re now reading about Defoe
and London in 1665.  So, let me give you a different and also dramatic
example.  And that was Naples in 1656.  </p>
<p>Naples, one of the
largest cities in Europe, especially vulnerable because of its urban poverty
and overcrowding, and its status as one of Europe&#39;s great port cities.  It had,
in 1656, the year of this terrible visitation, a population of 500,000--an
enormous city by seventeenth century standards--and 300,000 people died no less
in this visitation.  Every activity in Naples ceased at the time.  There was
general unemployment and universal hunger.  The living--as in the
clichÃ©--weren&#39;t sufficiently numerous to bury the dead, and I mean that
literally.  Cadavers were left, not only in doors, but in all public places.
In the end, some 60,000 bodies were burned in pyres, and 20,000 more were
unceremoniously dumped into the sea.  </p>
<p>Imagine a great city,
then, with the intolerable stench of decomposition, with dogs, vultures and
ravens picking at cadavers, and a total breakdown of law and order in every
public service.  Imagine too the flight of people, the sense that the end of
the world was at hand.  And indeed one of the popular images of the plague in
art was a black figure on horseback, one of the dread horsemen of the
Apocalypse who had come on this final day of reckoning.  So, it was from places
like this that everyone who could took to the roads, often with the fear in
their hearts that God and his anger were in hot pursuit.  </p>
<p>So, the first
spontaneous reaction was to escape.  But remember what we said about
humoralism, Hippocrates and Galen.  And if you&#39;ll remember then, looking back,
medical theory at the time sanctioned this particular reaction, or led to it
logically.  Because epidemics and humoral theory, as you now know, were caused
by an imbalance in the humors, triggered by a poisoned air, one of the &quot;six
unnaturals,&quot; a miasma.  In other words, the disease was tied to the air around
a given locality, and so it made perfect good sense, by the medical theory that
people had inherited, that they should escape the locale and therefore the
poisonous miasma.  </p>
<p>The response of
populations was mediated by the ideas that people had in their heads, by the
ways an epidemic was understood, or--in a fashionable modern phrase--how it was
socially constructed.  Now, orthodoxy was spawned in particular with an idea of
what&#39;s called miasmatism; that is to say there was a miasma, which is derived
from the Greek word for corrupted or defiled.  A miasma was a corruption, a
defilement or poisoning of the air.  Poisonous atoms, emitted by rotting
organic matter of infected people and the objects they had touched, were
released, became an effluvia in the air, which was poisoned thereby.  And once
the air had been made poisonous, it could be absorbed by anyone in a locality--through
the pores in the skin, perhaps, or by being inhaled.  So, the body would then
be poisoned like the air.  </p>
<p>And, so, the search
in the city was for a corrupting agent.  What did people who had this idea,
this medical philosophy of bubonic plague--where would their suspicious
alight?  Well, first they would fall on foul odors; and these were plentiful in
an early modern city.  There was the night soil that people hurled from their
windows and doors, the offal that butchers swept into the streets.  There were
the products, the noxious products, of stinking trades, like metal or
leatherworking, or the retting of hemp and so on.  This meant that the logical
consequence would be urban cleanups.  And, so, authorities ordered cleanups.
They collected refuse, closed down certain workshops and trades, cleansed the
streets, halted work in abattoirs, and ordered the prompt burial of cadavers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in
Christian Europe water had a symbolic, if we like, ritual cleansing attached to
it.  It was a purifying quality because of its role in baptism, where it
cleansed the soul.  So, throughout Europe, cities ordered their streets
cleansed with water in times of plague.  They did more though than just cleanse
the streets.  They tried also to cleanse the air directly.  There were bonfires
that were set, especially with aromatic wood like pine, or with sulfur.  And
there was the firing of cannon, with the idea that this too would purify the
air.  Those were authorities who took those measures.  </p>
<p>There were also ideas
of individual self-protection.  And since the cause of the plague was this
horrible poisoned air around you, it was a good idea to have a little vial of
aromatic spices around your neck, or it might be vinegar; and tobacco had a
certain popularity, as people smoked their way to health in the seventeenth
century.  It was also wise to shut up windows and doors, if you were indoors,
to prevent the poison from entering your home.  The garments of people who were
infected also fell under suspicion, because the miasmatic poison was held to
cling to them, just as you know in your own experience that the scent of
tobacco or perfume can cling to a dress, a sweater, a shirt.</p>
<p>Well, for this
reason, people also tried to protect themselves with special plague costumes.
You can see you&#39;d be very handsome dressed like that.  And the idea was that
the costume would be waxed, because that would prevent anything from adhering
to it.  In this case they weren&#39;t thinking about fleas, they were thinking
about the atoms of the corrupted, defiled atmosphere.   And you&#39;ll note that
there&#39;s a prominent feature; is the beak here.  And it&#39;s not because it&#39;s a
bird.  The idea was that in the beak you would fill it with herbs that were
spicy and would protect you that way.  </p>
<p>And you&#39;ll notice
that the person is carrying a rod.  That&#39;s not for instructive purposes.
That&#39;s to keep people away, at a safe distance from you.  So, what better way
than to be a bit like a verger?  Or let me show you another example.  And here
you might have your own brazier of coal that&#39;s burning, and you might have
sulfur or something else that would scent the atmosphere around you.  And
always, of course, you would have your stick to keep people at a good safe
distance to you.  </p>
<p>You also took other
precautions.  You would approach a plague victim, if you suspected that you
were encountering one, upwind, and it was said that plague victims could be
approached if you stayed upwind and kept your distance.  But for those who
approached downwind, illness was likely, and the outcome would depend on a
body&#39;s susceptibility, on its organic disposition, that would determine the
balance of the four bodily humors.  If the balance was precarious, any small
influence that disturbed the equilibrium could be fatal, such as fear, a
dissolute lifestyle, a sudden chill.  </p>
<p>But this idea of
cleansing, in early modern Europe, could also have more sinister and
ritualistic possibilities.  And these were derived from ancient popular ideas
of magic, of God&#39;s anger and punishment for sin.  In other words, the contamination,
it was thought by many people, could have moral causes, which had stirred the
divine wrath.  So, a vigilant community might well try to identify and cast out
those who were morally responsible for the calamity.  Sin could be the abuse of
food and drink; excessive sleep and idleness; immoderate, unnatural or sinful
sex; or blasphemous religious practices and beliefs.  </p>
<p>Let me show you this
rather terrifying slide by Jules Elie Delauney, of 1869, which is called &quot;The Plague of
Rome.&quot;  And it refers to the Rome plague in the seventeenth century, a
major epidemic.  And what we see here is the Angel of God pointing out to the
avenging angel the home of a sinner, and the plague is about to destroy the
sinners inside.  This is the idea that people had in their heads.  So, with
that idea, who might be inside?  Well, suspicion fell on prostitutes, for
example, and they were rounded up in many places and expelled from towns, and
brothels were closed.  It might fall also on infidels, religious dissenters,
Jews and gypsies.  There might be attacks on foreigners and outsiders, witches
and lepers who were already suspected of being grievous sinners.  Or for people
who had the view that predestination could be seen by your outward success in
life, whether you were the elect or not, was visible by your worldly wealth,
then beggars, by their poverty and misfortunes, were seen as having already
received a first installment of the punishment they deserved for their secret
sins.  </p>
<p>So, towns throughout
Europe closed themselves to outsiders, and inside the towns undesirables might
be rounded up and expelled.  Or worse still, in some places there were
stonings, lynchings, burnings at the stake; full-scale pogroms, or what we
might today call ethnic cleansing.  The poisoning hysteria reinforced this
idea, and there was often an hysteria that the poisoning and the atmosphere was
not a natural event but a crime.  And there were anointers called &quot;untori,&quot;
or poisoners, who were out to destroy people.  This was a diabolical plot, and
so a hunt was often on to find the culprits.  </p>
<p>Let me give two
famous and notorious examples, a first and early one at Strasbourg in the
fourteenth century, where rumor had it--you&#39;ll remember in the fourteenth
century, the Jews were cast out of the Iberian Peninsula, and the panicked fear
was that they were carrying out a plot as vengeance to destroy Christian Europe
by poisoning the wells of Christendom.  So, crowds at Strasbourg rounded up 8,000
Jews, took them to the Jewish cemetery and burned them alive.  Or let me tell
you another example from Milan in 1630, and not really a more cheerful one at
all, although on a smaller scale.  And it&#39;s told in one of the--two
actually--of the great works by the inventor of the Italian novel, and one of
the great European novelists of the nineteenth century, Alexander Manzoni.  The
novel is called <i>The Betrothed</i>.  And he also wrote a historical work
called <i>The Column of Infamy</i>--that is to say, Milan.  </p>
<p>Here&#39;s a picture of
the event I want to tell you about, as described by Manzoni, acting as a
historian.  The city of Milan in 1630 was at war with Spain, and to their
misfortune, four hapless Spaniards were found in the city, just as plague was
breaking out, and they were accused of starting it by spreading poisonous
ointment on the doors of the houses of the city.  Under torture, they confessed
to the crime and were convicted of high treason, and then sentenced to have
their hands cut off, to be broken on the wheel, and then burned at the stake.
So, at the site of their execution--and hence the term--we have this, which is
the Column of Infamy.  </p>
<p>You can see the
prisoners being brought, and you can see they&#39;re being broken on the wheel, and
all the rest of it in the picture.  And you can also see that there was erected--here&#39;s
the chief criminal, Jacob Mora.  And on the site in Milan, after the plague, a
plaque was posted--the column was meant to deter anyone else from ever doing
something so diabolical--and this plaque was placed in Latin saying what had
happened and what the punishment had been, and warning people to commemorate
this event; that no house should ever be built on this site.  And this is the
inscription on the plaque.  So, those were reactions.  </p>
<p>Another reaction was
one of mass repentance to propitiate an angry divinity.  And to do that, how
did you go about it?  One way was by outdoor processions, confessing your sins,
repenting, and urging your neighbors and everyone else you encountered to do
the same.  There were religious revivals.  The plague years were marked in
particular by a new cult of saints, the ones held to be most willing to
intercede on behalf of humanity and to divert the divine anger.  There was a
great cult of the Virgin Mary.  There was a cult of Saint Christopher.  But in
particular, of two new saints who had an extraordinary vogue during the plague
year.  The first was Saint Sebastian, and the other was Saint Rocco or Saint
Roch.  </p>
<p>Here is Saint
Sebastian.  And if you think of the iconography, you&#39;ll remember that when we
talked in the first lecture about Homer, we saw that Apollo took arrows to
shoot the plague, to destroy the Greeks.  And so there has been a constant idea
symbolically of arrows as symbols of the plague, and Saint Sebastian is someone
who was willing to give his life to save his fellows, by absorbing the arrows
into his own flesh.  He was martyred by the arrows, and this was said to be his
way of defending humanity.  So, there was a great vogue in this era of Saint
Sebastian, who was invoked to help human beings to avoid the plague.  </p>
<p>Another was Saint
Rocco.  Now, who was he?  He was an aristocrat from Montpellier, and according
to legend he gave his riches away to the poor, and set off on a pilgrimage to
Italy, where he had the great misfortune of arriving--and you know it was a
misfortune--in 1348, at the onset of the Black Death.  He, however, fell ill,
but survived.  And then he stayed to tend to the ill, only eventually to return
to France where he faced arrest and finally died in prison.  Like Saint
Sebastian, he was a man who was held to be willing to sacrifice his body, his
wealth and his life, to save the people of God.  </p>
<p>So, images of these
saints--and we&#39;ll look at this next time when we look at the artistic
representations, the legacy of bubonic plague on the arts--images of these
saints, in particular, proliferated in this period--at the entrances to houses,
in people&#39;s bedrooms, in public squares--as a protection against the plague.
And there was a vogue in these saints&#39; names that parents gave their children.
Another way to propitiate--I said professions.  Well, one of the mysterious
movements of the plague years, in the early time of the third pandemic, was a
mass movement known as the flagellants.  Here the adherents vowed to devote
themselves for a month to mass pilgrimage and repentance.  They carried the
cross.  They prayed.  They listened to preachers, and they underwent public
whipping and indeed self-flagellation, in order to satisfy God&#39;s anger.  And
when you come to look at the film by Ingmar Bergman, <i>The Seventh Seal</i>,
one of the depictions in that, one of the scenes that will be most interesting
to you, is the capturing on film of this procession of the flagellants.  You
see them praying and beating themselves, and each other, with whips.  </p>
<p>We will see next time
too that this affected the iconography of European Art, from the fourteenth
century through the seventeenth.  There is a theme we&#39;ll see next time of the
dance of death, the so-called <i>danse macabre</i>, of people being rounded up
by the grim reaper.  There are also what are called vanitas symbols, which are
symbols in art of how life is very insecure; that it&#39;s brief and can end very
unpredictably.  Now, these weren&#39;t a school of painting, or an artistic style,
they were the iconography.  They were themes that painters depicted.  And it
may also be that portraying the disease in this way was a kind of exorcism of
the mysterious scourge, and this was a powerful reminder of the transience of
all things.  </p>
<p>There were also
popular superstitions in these days.  From astrology, there was the belief that
certain metals or precious stones--rubies and diamonds--had protective
properties against the plague, as did certain magical numbers.  And it won&#39;t
surprise you that one of the great numbers that you could conjure with was the
number four.  You know the drill: four elements, four temperaments, four
evangelists, four humors, four winds, four seasons, and so on.  So, the number
four was very powerful and protective.  Another aspect of plague, of course, was
that there were people who profited from it, profiteering.</p>
<p>The great cities in
grip of plague were lands of opportunity, for rogues of every sort.  The
epidemics of disease brought, in their train, outbreaks of crime and
swindling.  Thieves plundered the homes of those who had fled--remember, those
who had fled were usually the wealthy--and charlatans peddled every variety of
magical remedies, while astrologers sold comfort and advice.  Healers charged
astounding sums for practicing their dangerous arts.  Those were forms of
spontaneous reaction to plague.  </p>
<p>What I&#39;d like to do
next is to talk instead about something very different, that I promised, which
is organized response by authorities.  And this is the first form of organized
public health, that eventually leads, by the late seventeenth and the early eighteenth
centuries, to the first victory of human beings over a major infectious
disease.  So, let&#39;s look at what those public health measures were.  Well,
empirical observation in time of plague gave rise not only to spontaneous
reactions that we&#39;ve described but also to a new idea that began to spread
alongside medical orthodoxy--a new idea, the idea of contagion.  That somehow
the plague spread in an unspecified manner from person to person.  This idea
was largely rejected for centuries by learned official medicine, which clung to
the older idea of miasmatism of Galen and his system.  But it became an
important idea in popular culture, and in the thinking of certain medical
heretics.  It was fully developed by Fracastoro--whom we&#39;ve mentioned
before--of Padua in Italy, in the sixteenth century; but also by the German
Jesuit Kircher in the seventeenth century.  </p>
<p>The theory was that
of a so-called <i>contagium vivum</i>, which consisted of animalcules of some sort.
Public policy was--to deal with plague--was first devised in the northern
Italian city-states, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries--places like
Florence, Venice, Milan and Genoa--and then were adapted elsewhere, in France
and Spain and Northern Europe.  What was involved, as I say, was momentous; the
world&#39;s first system of public health.  And it turned out to be an
organizational idea of genius.  The embryo of the system was established during
the Black Death, and then became increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive
through the middle of the sixteenth and seventeenth and then the eighteenth
centuries.  But the Achilles heel, early on, was that the system was narrowly
municipal or local in scope.  A quantum leap was made that turned to make it
more effective in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the idea was
taken up by early modern states that devoted the military power of the state to
the effort.  </p>
<p>You&#39;ll note the
operation of magistrates, and their power in London, as you&#39;re reading Defoe,
in the seventeenth century.  So, the early vision combined, by this time, with
the necessary power over a sufficiently large area to make success possible.
Now, an interesting aspect of the situation is this: the authorities took
action, although there was no medical understanding of--or at least nothing
that we would regard retrospectively as an efficacious understanding of the
disease they were facing.  They acted more or less in the dark, and in the
process took measures that were sometimes extreme and heavy-handed; that often
wasted resources and were sometimes actually counterproductive.  But in the
end, the path they pioneered led to the first victory over a major human
disease.  </p>
<p>So, let&#39;s look at the
policies.  What were they?  First of all was a new institution.  Originally,
that is, they were called health magistrates.  We now know them as boards of
health.  And these magistrates, or boards of health as they came to be known
later and are still known, were endowed with extraordinary powers during
emergencies that gave them--they combined in their hands a plentitude of
legislative, judicial and executive authority in matters that related to public
health.  By the late sixteenth century, cities in the vanguard of the movement
even had permanent health magistrates, and their example was followed across
Europe.  That was one thing, a new authority then.  </p>
<p>A second plague
measure was compulsory burial.  And there were so many dead in a major epidemic
that you wanted to dispose of them quickly before they poisoned the atmosphere,
and you couldn&#39;t bury them individually, and so they were cast into common
pits, plague pits.  And this was followed by the destruction by fire of their
personal effects, and the banning of funerals and funeral processions, a
banning of the laying out and the wake.  And this problem of burial was an
important issue in every outbreak of plague.  Priests and gravediggers were
decimated, and there weren&#39;t enough people left then to dispose of the dead in
normal ways.  And it must be remembered that this generated terror in itself; the
presence of large numbers of unburied cadavers, in a city where the indignity
of disposal of hurling newly dead people into improvised pits heightened the
horror of the disease.  </p>
<p>Another feature of
the plague measures was the control of movement--the control of the movement of
people from plague-infested regions by quarantine, and squads of soldiers
turning people away from city gates and opening fire on those who tried to
cross the line.  Another feature of these times was the isolation of the
infected, in pest houses, known across Europe as lazarettos.  Or alternatively,
as you know from Defoe, people were simply shut up, together with their
families in their own homes, and forbidden to open the door, while guards
enforced the rule and were stationed outside.  Most fearful of all was a
measure called &quot;general quarantine&quot;, in which everyone in an infected
neighborhood was sealed inside his or her home for forty days, with watchmen outside
to arrest or even kill those who tried to escape.  </p>
<p>Let me show you a
slide--well, this is actually not the one I had in mind--this is Marseilles in
1720 to 1722, during the time of the plague.  And if you looked carefully, you
could see many of the events that we&#39;ve been describing taking place in the
foreground.  But instead of that, I&#39;d rather concentrate on this, because this
has to do with your reading in Daniel Defoe.  This is London in 1656, that you
now know and love.  And you can see here the bonfires, an attempt to purify the
air.  You can see these are watchmen stationed outside to prevent people
leaving their houses.  And you can see the homes that are shut up and sealed,
with people inside, are marked, that these are the homes of plague victims.  </p>
<p>So, those were
important, those regulations.  Then there were lazarettos, the pest houses.
And these shouldn&#39;t be confused with modern hospitals.  They weren&#39;t places of
cure but rather barrack-like places of horror and death, where inmates died en
masse; where people were locked up, not so much to be cured, but to spare the
city of the danger of inhaling deadly vapors from their contaminated bodies.
The pest house was really the antechamber to eternity.  And the word lazaretto
comes from a biblical reference to Lazarus, who was raised from the dead.  </p>
<p>In any case, let me
show you a slide of a lazaretto.  This is a picture from the nineteenth century
by Gros of &quot;Napoleon in the Pest House of Jaffa.&quot;  And this is a
picture by Tintoretto, of whom we&#39;ll see much more next time.  This is Saint
Rocco--remember I promised you Saint Rocco, who stayed behind, who visited
Italy in time of plague, and fell ill himself, revived and stayed behind to
tend the dead or dying.  And here we see him in the lazaretto, which is pretty
much a place of dread and horror.  And people were conveyed there--and this was
important too--by carters.  </p>
<p>And the carters also
inspired fear.  People were forcibly gathered up and hurled into their mournful
heaving conveyances.  And these were dreaded almost as much as the disease
itself.  This fear often was due to the fact that these petty officials risked
their lives as an investment through extortion.  Healthy men and women could be
threatened.  The ill could be blackmailed, so they could be left to die at
peace in their homes.  Burglars could be sold information on empty houses.  And
often they were drunk, as they consumed spirits to fortify their courage.  </p>
<p>Another part of the
plague regulations was the control of markets and provisions, to guarantee the
supply of food to an afflicted locality, so that people wouldn&#39;t die of famine,
as well as disease.  The health magistrates, or boards of health, had also the
power to close brothels and arrest prostitutes.  As I&#39;ve said, they often
attempted to purify the corrupted atmosphere with bonfires and with sulfur and
gunpowder.  Well, taken together, all of these plague measures were draconian,
and when first applied they probably increased fear and chaos, promoted flight
by people desperate not to be locked in a dying city or carted away to a pest house.
And this may have assisted the spread of plague itself.  </p>
<p>Anti-plague
regulations were causes of suffering, and they often met in various parts of
Europe with fierce opposition and caused civil disturbance and social
tensions.  They involved the infinite horror of the pest house; the separation
of family members; the burning of precious possessions; the prohibition of
processions and gatherings; the prohibition of movement; the closing of
markets; the denial of funeral observances.  So, from Moscow to London, all
across Europe, the passage of plague was marked by demographic disaster, by
social tensions and economic disruption.  Great cities took on the appearance
of ghost towns.  And these scenes were repeated for centuries after 1347, with
outbreaks here and there every generation, and great European-wide pandemics
several times a century.  </p>
<p>As you know, the
normal pattern was that the plague laid waste to a locality for months, and
then the disease ebbed and faded away, as mysteriously as it began.  And this
too left a legacy.  For the faithful, the final departure of the plague was a
sign that God had been appeased, and was a testimony to the wisdom of their
repentance, and perhaps to their decision to hunt out the guilty in their
midst.  And let me remind you that this still is marked in the landscape of
urban Europe.  And I&#39;d like to show you an example.  And this will be the
Castel Sant&#39;Angelo, right here, one of the most common tourist sites of memory
in modern Rome today.  That&#39;s a general view.  </p>
<p>Let&#39;s close in a
little more closely.  And here we can see as we&#39;re approaching the Castel
Sant&#39;Angelo--I want you to see--I&#39;ll have a next picture where we&#39;ll look at
the top.  And this then is one of the major landmarks in a major European city
today.  And what is it?  It&#39;s due to plague.  At the top of the Castel
Sant&#39;Angelo is the archangel Gabriel, and what he&#39;s doing is sheathing his
sword, as a sign the divine wrath had been appeased, that God had relented and
that the scourge of the population of Rome was no more.  For a modern
epidemiologist, the thinking might be quite different; that a vital link in the
great chain of infection had been broken, in the chain of transmission; perhaps
that the infected population of black rats had been destroyed; that all of the
susceptible members of the human population had already perished; that the
onset of winter and cold weather had reduced the activity of fleas.  </p>
<p>In any case, the
point I want to make was that eventually the plague measures and regulations
were, or at least seemed to be, effective, especially after the seventeenth
century with the increased military power of an early modern state that
deployed standing armies and naval forces to apply the policy rigorously and
over a substantial territory.  Venice provided perhaps the first important
example; that was soon imitated in country after country, until Western Europe
was medically isolated by quarantines, lazarettos and sanitary cordons.  </p>
<p>Let me talk a little
more in detail about the Venetian idea of public health.  It was that--and
Venice was a great port, as you know--that the ports of Europe could be
protected by isolation from an invasion by sea.  To achieve this objective, the
authorities constructed a great fortress on the outlying islands, to which all
arriving ships from the Eastern Mediterranean were directed.  There they were
impounded for six weeks, while they were scrubbed and fumigated.  Crews and
passengers were disembarked at these fortresses and quarantined for forty
days.  And the cargo and passengers&#39; effects were unloaded, turned in the sun,
fumigated and aired.  And only at the end of forty days were goods shipped and
passengers released to enter the city at will.  The theory was that by strict
quarantine any pestilential vapors would be given time to disperse.  And so the
city might be spared.  </p>
<p>Well, let&#39;s look at a
couple of lazarettos.  This is at a port called La Spezia.  And the point I&#39;m
trying to make is that these were very complicated and authoritarian
institutions.  They&#39;re fortresses no less.  This is at Naples, the island of
Nisida.  Or at Marseilles, this is the great lazaretto on Pharo Island.  This
was simple in principle.  It was a maritime quarantine.  But to be effective,
it presupposed state power.  A lazaretto was a fortress for thousands of
passengers and crew; had to be policed, provisioned and isolated from all
contacts with the city.  It required a strong naval presence too, to compel
unwilling and possibly terrified sea captains to anchor within these waters,
and to prevent attempts at evasion or escape.  </p>
<p>Within the lazaretto,
there were detailed, complex regulations to ensure that hundreds, sometimes
thousands of passengers, in different stages of quarantine, would be isolated
not only from the city but also from each other, and that the items of the
ship&#39;s crew would all be properly fumigated and exposed to the sun.  The idea
of quarantine was an empirical result of long experience, and its
establishment, to be successful, presupposed the bureaucratic naval and
administrative resources of the early modern state.  Well looking back with
modern understanding, you would probably conclude that the medical theory
underlying the Venetian system of quarantine was flawed by modern standards.
There were no pestilential miasmas, and many of the rituals of purification
were to no effect.  But the idea of lengthy and military-enforced isolation was
highly effective in practice.  Forty days exceeded the incubation period of the
disease, and so were sufficient to guarantee that a person then released was
medically harmless.  At the same time, the period of quarantine was long enough
to ensure the death of infected fleas, and of the bacterium itself.  </p>
<p>So, an inaccurate
theory produced sound administrative procedures.  The Venetian lazaretto,
backed by the Venetian fleet, demonstrated that it could, in practice, protect
the city from disaster.  And within a generation, other Mediterranean powers
imitated the experiment, building lazarettos: Naples, Genoa, Valencia,
Marseilles, Corfu.  And all ships from the East were compelled to dock at
them.  By the end of the seventeenth century, the port cities of Europe were no
longer so menaced by sea.  The disease continued to be imported, but was
contained with just two major failures.  In 1720, bubonic plague spread from
the lazaretto to the city of Marseilles, killing 60,000 people.  And then in
1743, the last burst of epidemic plague in Europe, at Messina in Sicily.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there was
the overland threat, and this was seen to by the Hapsburg Empire which, in the
course of the eighteenth century, initiated and perfected a great permanent <i>cordon
sanitaire</i> of soldiers, stretching across the length of the Balkan
Peninsula.  The Austrian cordon was ten to twenty miles wide during threat of
plague, and 1,200 miles long.  It consisted of a great permanent line of
soldiers and sentry posts, stationed to prevent people from passing.  So, one
of the great armies of Europe assumed the task of isolating Western Europe,
from the east, just as the lazarettos and the ports isolated it by sea.
Thousands of soldiers, 12,000 during times of epidemics, were stationed to do
that.</p>
<p>And it was the case
then, by the eighteenth century, bubonic plague, the scourge of five centuries,
was entirely eliminated, and didn&#39;t return to Western Europe.  Let me look
at--this is a slide of a--it could be anywhere, it happens to be the city of
Bari.  And you can see the cordon of soldiers surrounding the city and
protecting it from bubonic plague. And it might be said as well that
occasionally the pope reinforced the physical sanitary cordon with a spiritual
one; that is, threatening anyone who crossed the line with excommunication.  </p>
<p>Well, this was the
world&#39;s first victory in the conquest of disease.  The greatest epidemic
disease in European history had been eliminated, not by the advance of medicine
or scientific knowledge, but by the deployment of the military and bureaucratic
power of the state.  Or certainly so it seemed, though we might wonder if other
perhaps imponderable factors were also at work.  The replacement of our friend
the black rat, who you now know and love, that was very sociable and liked to
live close to human beings, by the brown rat, that was shy and retiring and
kept its distance.  Or there were improved standards of sanitation and
hygiene.  Or people talked about the impact--perhaps it was climatic change
that was decisive.  And people point to the Little Ice Age, which began in the
sixteenth century and reached minima of temperatures about 1650, and again in
the 1770s, and then gave way to warming in the nineteenth century.  </p>
<p>And we see this in
works of art, in Dutch painting.  The seventeenth century gave rise to a great
vogue of winter scenes that you don&#39;t really see in the modern Netherlands,
when the canals froze in the seventeenth century and people were able to skate
on them.  And there were many other examples of winter scenes of painting.
This was how cold it was in the seventeenth century.  Indeed, it swept all of
Europe.  The River Thames froze in London.  The Baltic froze, so that one could
travel by sled from Poland to Sweden. And these weren&#39;t good conditions for <i>Yersinia
pestis</i>, and the fleas that were its vectors.  But we&#39;ve run out of time.
But at least we&#39;ve contained the plague.  And next time we&#39;ll look at its
impact on European culture and thought. </p>
