<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Good morning. We can get started. And this morning will be a slightly
different style of lecture. You&#39;ll notice that you don&#39;t have handouts, and that
wasn&#39;t an oversight. It was actually because you won&#39;t need them this
morning. What we&#39;re going to be doing is something of an experiment, which is
that it seemed to me that it was useful, when you were reading various
historical works, that sometimes the author of one of them should explain and
discuss with you how they came to be as they are. So, that was one of the
reasons that I put my own book, this one, on Naples, on the reading list. And
I thought this morning I&#39;d try the experiment of a different kind of lecture,
where I talk to you about how it came to be the work that it is. </p>
<p>We&#39;re moving on now
from the material on the Paris School and on plague and smallpox, to our next
major epidemic disease, which was the great feared disease of the nineteenth
century, which was Asiatic cholera, which hit Europe--it wasn&#39;t an endemic
disease--it hit Europe for the first time around 1830, and returned in a series
of pandemics in various waves. And normally the official historiography has it
that about the last epidemic in Western Europe was in the 1890s. And the
statistics of the WHO in the various countries of Europe support--and the
literature as well--support this conclusion, that Asiatic cholera, after the
1890s, returns again to Western Europe only in tiny little outbreaks, the last
of which was 1973. </p>
<p>So, there really
isn&#39;t supposedly a history of cholera in the twentieth century in Europe. And
it&#39;s that that I want to challenge and to talk with you about this morning.
Now, as I began--and here we can start into how the book came to exist at all.
I, at the time--well, one, there&#39;s this sort of, as I started doing research on
a very different topic, I had, in a sense perhaps, been primed for an interest
in cholera. I had been primed because I had lived through an outbreak in Rome
in 1973, and I had noticed a number of things that had captured my attention--because
this was Italy, this world seventh industrial power at the time--and I remember
some strange phenomena. </p>
<p>Being in Rome--the
epidemic had started and found its epicenter in the city of Naples. And cars
had, at that time, license plates that bore the province of origin of the
vehicle, and cars in Rome that had Naples license plates were being stoned by
the citizens of Rome. It was also true that in the fish and vegetable markets
near the apartment where I was living, that the stalls of the fish and
vegetable sellers were attacked and overturned by crowds. So, this seemed
something that captured my imagination very clearly. And then the minister of
health went on television and said that you really didn&#39;t need to worry because
all you had to do was to squeeze--because the <i>Vibrio</i>, the bacterium that
causes Asiatic cholera, is highly susceptible to acid; so all you have to do is
squeeze a little lemon juice on your raw mussels, and then you can quite
happily eat them; which I wouldn&#39;t advise any of you. </p>
<p>In any case, it was
also true that this prime minister and the minister of health visited Naples
and the infectious diseases hospital there. And there&#39;s an Italian magazine in
which pictures of them appeared, and you could see them almost running down the
wards, as they were visiting the patients, and behind them they had their
hands--you can imagine them trotting--with this gesture, which is a gesture to
ward off the evil eye in Italian culture. So, this seemed rather strange in
the world&#39;s seventh industrial power. In a sense I had, then, this subliminal
message that came from an earlier experience.</p>
<p>But there I was, a
decade or so later, and my project was--I thought that I was interested in
political philosophy and social history, and I was working on the disappearance
of the European peasantry under the press of economic circumstances, and major
transformations in the countryside, and the coming of the commercial revolution
in agriculture, urbanization and the Industrial Revolution. But I began to
have my imagination captured by numbers of references that I began to find
around the early twentieth century to cholera in Italy around 1910. And that
seemed a little surprising to me, and it really began--I began to read more
about it. And it seemed to illustrate how people&#39;s lives were lived, and their
standard of living, much better than the project that I originally began with.
</p>
<p>And, so, I let this
medical project have a life of its own, and this is what eventually became my
book. As I was working more on cholera, however, something else came to the
forefront of my attention, and that was a conflict between what I read about
cholera in the literature and what I was beginning to find in my own research.
The literature said that there wasn&#39;t a major epidemic in the twentieth century
in Europe, the last major one being in the 1890s. But I was beginning to find
odd references to some very strange events, particularly in the summer of 1911,
and I began to think that perhaps a very interesting policy of concealment was
taking place; that is, an epidemic that was concealed by the authorities. And
Naples once again was a very interesting place. </p>
<p>Now, Naples is, if
you&#39;re interested in cholera in the West, Naples is a very interesting place
because it was the city--it was the largest city in Europe in the nineteenth
century, and it was scourged the most often by this affliction. And I&#39;m going
to be arguing that it was scourged also in times that aren&#39;t recorded in the
standard historiography of the subject, and in particular in 1911. It also is
an extraordinary place because it has something happen that you won&#39;t find
elsewhere, and that is this is a city that was actually, after the dreadful
epidemic of 1884, was rebuilt in order to make the city cholera-proof, so that
it wouldn&#39;t return. </p>
<p>So, we see an
extraordinary--we talk about the impact of infectious diseases, and here we see
a case study of a place where the city itself is reconstructed specifically as
result of an epidemic catastrophe, in order not to make another one possible. We
can directly see in bricks and mortar, and in the sewers underground and the
buildings above, and in the layout of the city, you can see the impact of
cholera and of the idea of miasma. Because the miasmatic interpretation was
the one under which had guided the reconstruction of the city, which happened
in the wake of the 1884 catastrophe. But in 1911, there was no public record
of a major epidemic. I had a whiff of the fact that there was, but I couldn&#39;t
prove it. </p>
<p>So, how do you go
about demonstrating an epidemic that doesn&#39;t have a literature? I thought that
the first thing that would be useful to do would be to visit Naples, and in
particular to visit the Naples Cemetery. The cemetery is a very large one--you
can visit it yourselves--and it&#39;s a very monumental grand cemetery. And I went
in the middle of the week with the idea that I would go to the registry and
perhaps there find records of burials, and that I would also be able to see in
stone the victims of a major epidemic. In other words, the first idea I had
was that you can&#39;t--in order to prove that there was an epidemic, you would
have to have a sudden bulge in mortality in the summer months of 1911. And I
thought I could demonstrate that by visiting the Naples Cemetery, and if there
wasn&#39;t a sudden excess of death in the summer, then I would know that I was
actually on the wrong trail entirely and I should abandon my project. </p>
<p>Well, as I was
walking through the monumental cemetery--I think it was a Wednesday or a
Thursday--I suddenly had a car pull up alongside me, and the man inside said,
&quot;Get in, get in.&quot; I don&#39;t know exactly how you would have reacted.
I hesitated; particularly as it was a cemetery in which on a Wednesday and a
Thursday I found myself completely alone, except for this strange request that
I get in a car with someone I had never seen before. Well, it turns out, as we
talked, that he was the director of the cemetery, and he had come to rescue
me. And, so, I did eventually get in, and he took me out of the cemetery,
scolding me and telling me that I was obviously a stranger, an outsider and a
foreigner who knew nothing, and that, in fact, the Naples cemetery is the most
dangerous place you can be in the city, which has a long history of organized
crime, because during the week this was, in fact, where the local mafia did its
drug deals, and that everyone in Naples knew this except me, and he was
possibly saving my life by removing me. </p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t that I
wasn&#39;t welcome. I was welcome to come back on Saturday and Sunday, because
that&#39;s when all the people of Naples do come to pay their respects to their
relatives, and there are flower stalls and gazillions of people frequenting the
cemetery then, and the registry office with the records was also open then. I
also discovered that there was, in fact--by reading the newspapers surrounding
the time of my visit, that that very summer there was the--I was doing a little
checking up, and it turns out that the rector of the cemetery wasn&#39;t kidding me
at all--that there was a major drug bust in this very cemetery. And the way
they had done it was that they had wired the tombstones, and in this way they
had pulled off a major move against the Camorra, which is the local, if we
like, subset of the organized crime families in Italy, and one of the most
important crime syndicates in the world, in modern times. </p>
<p>So, that was--that
brought me back on a weekend. And on the weekend I discovered that there was,
in fact, a big mortality bulge; that there were lots of people who&#39;d been
buried in the summer of 1911, well in excess of the year before, 1910, 1909, or
the years that were succeeded, 1912 or 1913. And there was a book that
registered the deaths and burials, and there was a huge bulge in 1911. So, I
knew something had happened. And something was interesting, because one of the
features of the book that&#39;s the register of burials is that they provide the
neighborhood from which the deceased was resident. But in this case they,
instead of the usual record of a neighborhood, they had the marking Cotugno
Hospital, was the last place that the deceased had been. And the Cotugno
Hospital, then as now, was the infectious diseases hospital of the city. </p>
<p>I suddenly knew that
there was this great excess of mortality in the summer of 1911, and that the
mortality was from infectious diseases, because the people had been buried in
vast numbers from the Cotugno Hospital as their last port of call. Then the
next thought--and I think a lot of historical work is a bit like detective work--and
I found myself playing a sort of detective role. So, my next place to visit
was the Cotugno Hospital of Infectious Diseases. And I made two findings there
that were confirming me in my vision of what might have happened; that they
were--there was in the library of the hospital, the hospital itself had
preserved its own records, patient records. And after some persistence, I was
allowed to look at patient records in the hospital, and found something
interesting and mysterious, and that was that there were records of the patient
records through 1908, &#39;09, &#39;10, and the first half of 1911, and then suddenly
there were no records at all. </p>
<p>There was a
mysterious disappearance of the records of the patients of the hospital. Then
I went to the library of the Infectious Diseases Hospital, where there was a
second interesting thing, which was that the hospital had its own research
journal that it published, recording the research findings of its own
physicians, its own house physicians and interns and residents. The result of
that was to discover that for surprise, surprise, in the summer of 1911 the
physicians of the Cotugno Hospital were doing lots and lots of research on
therapeutics for Asiatic cholera. They were experimenting with giving patients
ice, and lots of other therapeutic procedures that we&#39;ll talk about in a couple
of minutes. So, I now knew that the physicians of the Infectious Diseases
Hospital were enormously preoccupied with Asiatic cholera. </p>
<p>Then the next place
was to go to the local archives, where I was told that my idea was impossible,
there was no such thing; that there also--the local records had been moved
during the Second World War out of the city for safekeeping, to the Sanctuary
of Monte Cassino, an abbey outside of the city. But I think a number of you
have heard of Monte Cassino. It became a major battle site in the war, and so
the abbey itself and all of the archives went up in flames, and so all the
records of the city for the period I was interested in were destroyed. And I
was told that a project of the kind that I was imagining was inconceivable and
also couldn&#39;t be carried out. So, what do you do next if you think there&#39;s a
major epidemic and you want to demonstrate its existence? </p>
<p>The next thing that
happened was that I had the idea that this was a time, in 1911, that was the
height of mass emigration of Italians--that is, I&#39;ve said that I had been
studying the disappearance of the European peasantry and its transformation
into workers or urban dwellers, and a part of that was the extraordinary story
of Italian transoceanic migration, in large part to this country, but also to Australia
and other places. So, I thought if there really was a mass movement--and
Naples is and was then a port. It was one of Europe&#39;s, along with Hamburg,
major port cities. And what Naples specialized in--if Hamburg specialized in
goods and services, Naples specialized in the export of people, and in
particular Italian emigrants to New York City. </p>
<p>There was enormous
transoceanic migration. I thought well, if this is true, and these thousands,
hundreds-of-thousands of emigrants are moving through the city of Naples, and
there is a major cholera epidemic, and they&#39;re arriving at Ellis Island, well
surely some of them will have been afflicted with the disease, and there would
be records there of that, at Ellis Island. Well, as it turns out, this was
true. There were records. Cholera did break out on a series of
emigrant-bearing ships in the summer of 1911, and people were quarantined for
the disease--Italians, that is, who had last been in Naples--were quarantined
for the disease on Ellis Island. And indeed, there had been a number of people
who were released from quarantine and fell ill on the mainland. And, so, there
are perhaps a dozen cases of people who fell sick in New York State and not on
Ellis Island itself. So, we know that there was then--there were Italian
emigrants coming to the United States who were afflicted with the disease. </p>
<p>This led me to think,
well, I do have a project, and now the point is to prove it further. What can
I find out about its reasons? What are the politics of concealment, and so
on? And I was lucky then because I was interested in a physician called
Leonard Rogers, who was one of the world&#39;s experts in tropical medicine at the
early years of the twentieth century. And it was he who in 1908 [correction:
1909] made a major discovery. In terms of the therapeutics of Asiatic cholera,
down to 1909, there was nothing that physicians could do that was effective and
helpful for their patients, and so the case fatality rate was something like
fifty percent for Asiatic cholera. In 1908 and 1909, Leonard Rogers, who was a
British physician working in India, had found that he could reduce the
mortality from fifty to fifteen percent--the first major advance in
therapeutics--and he did it, one by a simple building on something that had
been observed from the 1830s, and that is to say that cholera kills by
dehydration. </p>
<p>The bodily fluids
flow out of the rectum and the mouth through vomiting, at an extraordinary
rate, so that human beings lose up to three-quarters of the fluid portion of
their blood serum. And, so, from the 1830s onward, one of the therapeutic
ideas was why not simply replace the fluids? There were major attempts early
on to get people to drink lots of liquid. That doesn&#39;t work because you simply
vomit it up. It has no effect, except to make the patient weaker. So, having
discovered that, there were attempts by physicians to replace the fluids
intravenously. The problem early on was that there was not a knowledge--there
were several problems. How much liquid do you actually administer? And many
patients died of heart failure from an excess of fluid. It was also a time
before the discovery of the germ theory of disease, and so although they were
given drips that had clean water, it wasn&#39;t sterile and patients died of
septicemia. </p>
<p>It was also true that
another discovery, which was that the patients--what made people persist with
rehydration is that this administration of liquid caused the patients to feel
much better briefly. For a few hours they seemed to recover. They would sit
up in their beds and feel infinitely better. So something clearly positive was
going on. But what it was wasn&#39;t understood. And what happened was that the
administration of fluid was trying to replace fluid that had the same salinity
as the blood in the body. Unfortunately, that is not retained by tissues, and
it merely pours out of the body again. And, so, the patient who had
momentarily, for a few hours, felt better, relapses, and even the continuing of
this therapeutic attempt had no positive effect. </p>
<p>Well, Leonard Rogers
discovered in 1909 a number of things. He measured the amount of fluid loss.
He used distilled water, and he made it a hypertonic--that is, much more saline
than the blood fluid. And the result of that was that it was retained--through
mechanisms that aren&#39;t very well understood, the fluid was retained. And, so,
Leonard Rogers was able to save the lives of the vast majority of the patients
he treated for Asiatic cholera in India, and he wanted to--the problem was this
was a time in medical history when there were racial ideas of disease, and it
was thought the fact that he had discovered this with Indian bodies would have
nothing to do with European bodies. </p>
<p>So, partly for
humanitarian reasons and partly for scientific reasons, he was looking for an
outbreak of cholera in the West, in which he could apply his therapeutics and
demonstrate their ability to save life, any human life. And in 1911, because
he was watching very closely, he realized that there was an epidemic afoot in
Italy, and he sought permission to go to Naples to demonstrate the efficacy of
his new procedures. Soon I had Leonard--I was in contact with Leonard Rogers&#39;
family--and I had access to his papers, and his discussion of what happened to
him in the summer of 1911. Which was that to admit him to the hospital at
Naples to train physicians in saving lives, the best available practice, the
only therapy that had any effect, would be to admit the presence of an
epidemic. </p>
<p>And, so, he wasn&#39;t
allowed to come to mainland Italy. Instead he was allowed a two-week visit to
Sicily, where the disease spread as well. And the Italian physicians there
called him the &quot;prince of medicine,&quot; because they had a survival rate, under
his direction and his new rehydration method, of eighty-five percent, which was
extraordinary by international standards. He had discovered the first
effective therapy, one that is in fact the basis of present-day therapy for
cholera, which is oral rehydration. Leonard Rogers&#39; methods have been
perfected, but he was the one who found an effective rehydration system. </p>
<p>Soon we knew, then,
that the state in Italy, for various reasons, was preserving a secret and
denying its own citizens the most effective, the only effective available
system of care. So, Leonard Rogers left Italy in great disappointment, after
only being allowed to visit the cholera wards in Sicily, and was denied by the
state the ability to visit Naples, which was the epicenter of what was
happening. The next thing I was able to discover was that the records for this
epidemic--there were records, but they existed not in the usual places that
scholars would think of to study public health. The first files on this that I
discovered were in police records. And they happened in an odd way, which was
that the prime minister of Italy ordered the state police in Italy to deal with
a new offense, which was sanitary defeatism. And in order to preserve silence
and not promote sanitary defeatism, they began tapping the telephone lines used
by physicians, and censoring and opening physicians&#39; mail. </p>
<p>In the city of Venice
in 1911, there were actually the police records that demonstrated the following:
which was to say that the Venice Medical Society decided quite sensibly in the
summer of 1911 that it would save lives and enable people to protect themselves
by publishing pamphlets and distributing them, about Asiatic cholera and how
you can protect yourself against it. And they printed thousands of these, and
wall posters as well, to put up on the walls of Venice. Instead, the Medical
Society was visited by the police, who confiscated and burned all of the
pamphlets and all of the wall posters, and told the physicians of Venice, the
city, that to propagate health and sanitary defeatism would be fatal to their
careers. So, this was all preserved in the records of the police regarding the
summer of 1911 in Venice. </p>
<p>The next place that I
visited then was the National Archives here, and discovered that Italy had
signed, in 1903--and this means that all of the things that I&#39;m telling you
about marked a violation also of international law. Because in 1903 there was
a Paris Sanitary Convention, which made the full disclosure of infectious
diseases mandatory for--Italy and the United States were both signatories,
along with a series of other countries. And the physician who represented the
United States in 1903, a major cholera expert named Henry Geddings, was now
stationed at Naples with the U.S. Embassy, directing the medical service
there. Why Naples? Because Naples was the center of mass emigration from
Italy to the United States, and there were health inspections that took place
in the city before departure, and Henry Geddings was therefore in charge of
protecting the health of the United States by heading off infectious diseases
before people even boarded the ship. </p>
<p>Well, in 1911,
there&#39;s an extensive correspondence, and a very unhappy correspondence, by
Henry Geddings and people in the United States, including his superiors and his
family, about his experiences in the city, where he tried to report to the
United States Government that there was a major epidemic of Asiatic cholera.
He found that his life was threatened in the city of Naples, and his superiors
in the United States were not at all enthusiastic about receiving his message
of what was taking place, and so the United States Government--you&#39;ve met [U.S.
Surgeon General] Walter Wyman in your study of the bubonic plague and the
Barbary plague in San Francisco. Well, we meet him here again, actually
colluding with the Italian government in the suppression of knowledge about
this important major infectious disease, against international law that the
United States had actually signed. </p>
<p>Then there were--in
addition to that, I then went back to the police files and discovered that
there were also health statistics that were coming in to Rome, reporting events
in the Italian provinces, and they included statistics for Asiatic cholera.
But the prefects, who were the highest authority for law and order in each
Italian province, today as then, were actually sending back, to help officers
in the various provinces, the statistics they were receiving, saying that,
&quot;These aren&#39;t good statistics; we don&#39;t want them, send us something
better.&quot; And, so, you actually see the process by which the state
manufactured the health statistics that were subsequently published, and are
the basis for the historiography. And you can read those statistics in World
Health Organization reports, and Italian Government reports, and in U.S.
Government reports of the summer of 1911. </p>
<p>Now, why is this true
and why was this so sensitive? This meant that I needed to go back in time. My
first idea was to write the second half of the book, about concealment. And
I&#39;m introducing that--I think that&#39;s important in our course--because we&#39;re
talking about various strategies of public health, and so far we&#39;ve looked at
plague regulations and we&#39;ve looked at vaccine. But there&#39;s--as you will
remember probably from the SARS outbreak, that China practiced a policy of
concealment at the outset. What I&#39;m trying to say is that concealment is also
a style of public health policy. And I think our newspapers rather misled us
in leading us to believe that this was simply unique to China, something very
unusual. I would argue as well that this is probably something that&#39;s been
resorted to a number of times, and this epidemic of 1911 is a good example and
a good case study in which one can find the actual documents of the
concealment, and the reasons that it took place. </p>
<p>Well, why this
pressure? Why does the prime minister of Italy collude, and why the United
States, the Surgeon General of the United States, also colluded with that?
Indeed, I would tell you another little anecdote, which was that Walter Wyman
had a friend who was--friends, a couple he knew--who were the parents of young
Johnny, who just finished his B.A. degree in 1911--I&#39;m sorry not here in New
Haven, but rather at that other unmentionable place in Cambridge, Mass. And
having finished his degree in 1911, as a newly minted Bachelor of Arts, he was
planning a grand tour, which was going to take in Italy. And Italy had--this
was the fiftieth anniversary of Italian unification, and there was a major fair
with a grand U.S. pavilion, and Johnny was planning to visit; until, that is,
he got a letter from his friend, the U.S. Surgeon General, who wrote to
Johnny&#39;s parents that this trip simply wasn&#39;t on in the summer of 1911, because
due to infectious diseases it wasn&#39;t safe to visit Italy. </p>
<p>At the U.S. Pavilion,
also, the people, the organizers, wrote back to Washington, saying that they
were scandalized and horrified because American citizens were not being warned
that in fact there was cholera rampant in Italy and their health was at risk,
and there was no knowledge of this and no coverage of it in the press. Well,
why would this be happening? The first thing is that by this time there was an
enormous stigma associated with Asiatic cholera. Asiatic cholera in Western
Europe and in North America was supposedly vanquished by the bulwarks of
sanitation and public health. Cholera is spread by the ingestion--in only one
way--which is the ingestion of food and water contaminated with fecal matter.
And, so, it really is an indictment of sanitary standards. And therefore one
of the features was a matter of national pride for Italians not to admit that
there, in fact, there were these deficiencies in sanitary standards, in a
nation that was supposedly advanced and, as they would have said, civilized. </p>
<p>So, part of it then
is avoiding stigma; this was an important part of what happened. But in
addition, there was a patriotism involved, because this was the fiftieth
anniversary of Italian unification, and the whole world was descending on
Italy; or so it seemed, and Italians hoped. And to destroy the festivities by
putting them off, by warning the world that cholera was rampant in Italy at
this time, would have had enormous economic repercussions for tourism, a major
industry. It also would have had major repercussions in terms of Italian pride
in canceling the whole of the celebrations, a second feature. Another feature
has to do--is the fact that I&#39;ve just said, that the Italian economy and
Italian standards of living were dependent in part on the export of people at
this time. These were emigrants who came to these shores, and to South
America, and then sent back very large-scale remittances that were very
important to the Italian economy. And what would&#39;ve happened if the 1903
Sanitary Convention terms had been enforced, in Italy as it should have, and
was legally committed to doing, had announced the presence of Asiatic cholera,
that would have stopped emigration to these shores and to South America. And
that was something that Italians did not want to risk. And this also could
have had repercussions in terms of civil disorder. </p>
<p>There was a fear that,
then, too--cholera, as we&#39;ll see, is much associated with social tension and
disorder, and that was another fear that was very much in the minds of
Italians. But then there&#39;s something very specific, and that is that--as I
said in the beginning of our talk this morning--that Naples had been made
supposedly cholera-proof after the summer of 1884, when a catastrophic epidemic
had ravaged the city, and massive commitment of funds--Italian but also
Neapolitan and from abroad--had been devoted to this rebuilding of the city.
The problem is--I&#39;ve already said that Naples was the center of the Camorra, of
a major criminal syndicate, and was a place where funds often disappeared in
mysterious channels. And one of the features of the rebuilding project was
that the money largely went into undisclosed and corrupt channels. </p>
<p>Here we have a city,
which has supposedly been built like the Titanic, just hitting another iceberg
and discovering that, in fact, the funds that were to have made it safe have
been misspent. And there was an opposition to this municipal government in
Naples, which was using health as one of the complaints of the opposition
parties. The opposition parties in Naples at the time were republicans, socialists,
anarchists. And so part of the danger then, from the standpoint of the
government of the day, was that to admit this would lead to a major local
scandal, and would, if you like, legitimate the complaints and accusations of a
radical leftwing opposition. So, a consideration of political stability was
also part of the calculation. And this, in fact, was a motivating factor for
the U.S. Surgeon General and the U.S. Government; that here was a friendly
government that was being lampooned and lambasted by a radical, very left-wing
opposition, and it was better to cooperate then with the government, the
legitimate government, in the face of this opposition. </p>
<p>Well, this
concealment then went forward, and it was orchestrated at the very highest
levels. The press was censored. Health defeatism actually then became
something that the police regarded as an infringement and repressed. We&#39;ve
seen the way in which physicians and public health authorities were censored
and were threatened. In addition, it was not discussed in parliament, and it
wasn&#39;t even discussed in the Naples Municipal Council. And if you read the
reports--and I read the discussions of what was being discussed in Naples in
the summer of 1911--you see a discussion of the need for hiring lots and lots
of nurses, the need for many more doctors. And you see that they&#39;re importing
massive quantities of snow from the Apennines and the Alps into the city, and
it&#39;s taken to the Cotugno Hospital. And there, if you correlate that with what
the physicians were doing, they were giving ice to cholera patients on the ward
to deal with the tremendous thirst that they had, and to replace, they hoped,
some of the fluid that they were losing through the course of the disease. </p>
<p>So, that was
all--this conspiracy then is not a casual one. It&#39;s organized from the top
down, and is a very major and well-organized plot to conceal the existence of
this epidemic. In addition then, what were the consequences of concealment? I
want to argue that--throughout this course--that public health is dependent on
accurate and timely information. We&#39;ll see that today, in that a major feature
of public health policies is surveillance and monitoring, and the availability
of information, nationally and internationally, is vital to contain and prevent
pandemic afflictions. So, one of the features--and I think 1911 is a good
example of what happens if you don&#39;t provide information. </p>
<p>A first thing that
happened was that this disease spread through many provinces of Italy. It was
not contained domestically. Fortunately, it did not spread to these shores and
to Argentina and to other places where large numbers of Italians went. But I
think that was no thanks to the Italian government, it had to do with
serendipity and good luck. What I could say was that the Italian government,
with the collusion of the U.S. government, was placing the health of this
country, and the health of Argentina in particular, at risk. It was placing at
risk the health also of international visitors to Italy, tourists and people
who came to see the celebrations of 1911. And one of the truly unfortunate
parts of the concealment effects is that it led to thousands of deaths of
Italians. Because the patients on the wards of the Cotugno Hospital, and
elsewhere in Italy, were systematically denied what was then the best available
international practice, which is the administration of rehydration therapy, as
developed by Leonard Rogers, and Italian doctors weren&#39;t allowed to know that
this was the state-of-the-art and the way in which it was possible to save
Italian lives, reducing mortality from fifty to fifteen percent, or something
like that.</p>
<p>If you look at the
Cotugno ward, what were the physicians doing instead? Well, instead, because
cholera patients become tremendously cold and look as though they&#39;ve been
cadaverized, they were immersing cholera patients in hot tubs. Because for the
same way as their energy was failing, they were administering them stimulants,
caffeine. And there were various experiments with other things that were
meant--because there wasn&#39;t a therapy that was known to work, there were lots
of experimental therapies that were being tried. Strychnine, which you know
better as rat poison, was also administered to cholera patients, in an attempt
to revive their energy and their flagging health. Also there were attempts at
rehydration therapy. But this took the form that was now outdated, after 1908,
of trying to get the patients to suck on ice, or to drink, or to be injected
with isotonic saline solutions; that is, of the same content of salt, same
salinity as the blood, which by 1908, through a century of experience, was
known to be entirely useless. And these were the kinds of therapies that were
being practiced, plus simply supportive nursing care. And as I said, the
hospital was recruiting very large numbers of nurses. </p>
<p>So, nursing care and
various experimental and sometimes heroic interventions that led to a very high
mortality rate, when in fact it was possible to save about eighty-five percent
of patients. Well, I&#39;ve run out of time, and so I&#39;ll just say then that this
is how this particular book came to be. And I ended up writing, adding on,
that in order to understand 1911, it was absolutely crucial to see 1884 and the
steps that had been taken, unfortunately not so successfully, to make Naples
cholera-proof by the early twentieth century, when sadly it wasn&#39;t. And I think
there&#39;s a story there of concealment as a public health policy that I wanted to
alert you to as yet another style of public health, and one that has very--it&#39;s
not good for your health--and has very dire consequences. So, thank you. </p>
