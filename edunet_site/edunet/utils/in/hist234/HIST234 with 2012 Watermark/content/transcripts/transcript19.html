<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Good morning. You&#39;ll remember that last time we talked about dividing
tuberculosis into two major eras, in terms of the way that it was understood
and experienced by human society. The first era we talked about last time was
what I chose to call the age of consumption. At that time, only the lungs were
known to be affected by the disease, as all other forms of tuberculosis, as
it&#39;s now understood, were then thought to be instead different diseases. At
the time, the theory of anticontagionism, that by now is familiar to all of
you, was still dominant, and the tuberculosis patient was deemed to be, should
we say, blameless and harmless, as he or she had a disease thought to be
primarily hereditary. </p>
<p>The treatments in
fashion were still traditional remedies of nineteenth-century medicine, well
familiar to you: venesection, or bloodletting; poultices were applied, and
people were given medications with an aim of increasing their appetite, to
combat the wasting away; creosote was administered. We know it now primarily
as a wood preservative, but it was, in fact, in the nineteenth century, one of
the chief medications used to treat tuberculosis; and it was administered
sometimes internally, sometimes by inhalation to relieve the cough. It was
applied topically to the larynx, to ease the coughing and alleviate ulceration,
and sometimes there were sub-mucosal injections. Sometimes quinine was
administered, with the strategy of lowering a patient&#39;s fever. And we&#39;ve
talked about gasses that were administered to combat the infection directly in
the lungs, sometimes carbolic acid spray. </p>
<p>Opiates, like
laudanum, were sometimes given to relieve symptoms, and patients were advised
to travel to more salubrious climates, to visit the sea, the mountains, the dry
American southwest, the Mediterranean. And then we moved on from that period,
the age of consumption, and saw the beginning of the age--as I&#39;d like to call it
this morning--the age of tuberculosis, from around the 1880s. And this was
marked by a number of factors that came together to foster new attitudes, new
treatments, and new public health strategies to deal with tuberculosis. The
first--and this man is by now extremely famous to you, and that&#39;s Robert Koch,
once again--his theory of the germ theory of disease, and the discovery, as you
know, of the bacterium that&#39;s the causative agent in tuberculosis, in 1882.
But that wasn&#39;t sufficient to launch what we call the age of tuberculosis. In
addition, I would say that it was influenced by international politics; a
gathering of international tensions, clashing imperialisms, with colonial
expansion. </p>
<p>Remember then that
this is a time when population growth was held to be essential to military
strength; indeed, to national survival, to industrial production and economic
power. This was the age when social Darwinism was at its height. And in that
context, tuberculosis was held to be a real national danger. It was an
internal danger, and because of that, patients came to lose their glamour.
They were no longer regarded as creative, spiritual, sexy and ignoble, but were
thought to be a danger to health and to society. So, that was a second--should
we call it the social/economic/diplomatic context in which tuberculosis was
situated. And then there were epidemiological studies that went along in the
period. </p>
<p>Public health became
much more cognizant, through statistics, of the ravages of tuberculosis. There
were studies of its transmission in society, and knowledge, statistically
based, now replaced anecdote. And the implication was that although
tuberculosis did indeed affect the elites of society and the arts, it was in
fact disproportionately a disease of the poor, of the &quot;dangerous classes&quot; and,
in the American context, of unsavory, impoverished immigrants, a disease of
Irish and Italians. And, so, tuberculosis slowly becomes more stigmatized and
more shameful. </p>
<p>Well, the result of
all of these converging factors was from about 1880 to 1940, an age of
tuberculosis, certainly, but also a war on tuberculosis, with new strategies of
public health to combat what was seen to be a major national and international
menace. So, let&#39;s look at the weapons in the new war in anti-tuberculosis
public health. The first chronologically was also the most distinctive, and in
some ways the most interesting and creative, and this was the establishment of
sanatoria--or sanitaria, if you prefer--which gave rise to an international
sanatorium movement. The prototype, and the world&#39;s first TB sanatorium, was
founded in 1859. But the movement then slowly gathered momentum towards the
ends of the century, and then continued down to about the 1950s, when
antibiotics led to the closing of the sanatoria, and for a time a euphoric view
that tuberculosis was about to be eradicated; a view that unfortunately has
turned out not to be the case. </p>
<p>The founding father
of the sanatorium movement was a German, Hermann Brehmer. He was a physician,
and fell ill with tuberculosis--not something at all unusual--and expecting to
die, he traveled to take the cure in the Himalayas. To his surprise, though,
he recovered, and he attributed his improved health to fresh air, climate and
rest. And he thought that he could generalize that to treating patients, and
in 1859 he founded the world&#39;s first sanatorium in Silesia. This was followed
by Peter Dettweiler, who founded, in 1876, the second major sanatorium at
Falkenstein. </p>
<p>Despite those two
examples, the sanatorium idea didn&#39;t really take off to become a major movement
until the 1880s. And the decisive influence was that of the American physician
who has, through his offspring, a Yale connection, and that&#39;s Edward Livingston
Trudeau, who lived from 1848, and is well-known, the Trudeau name, to all of
you as the great-grandfather of Gary Trudeau of Doonesbury fame. Let me
just--I have a couple--that&#39;s Edward Livingston Trudeau. Let&#39;s remember a
moment about his life and how he came to play a major role in the sanatorium
movement. </p>
<p>He was a physician
educated at the Columbia Medical School in New York. His brother had
tuberculosis, and he died of it. He himself was diagnosed with tuberculosis in
the 1870s and--this is a story that you&#39;ve heard more than one--he too thought
that he was going to die. But he followed medical advice and went to an
outdoor climate to take the cure. In his case, his preferred destination was
the Adirondack Mountains, and specifically Saranac Lake in upper New York State.
At Saranac Lake, which was at the time not a town at all, it was the
wilderness, and Trudeau spent his time largely resting, and he would hunt from
fixed positions in a canoe on Saranac Lake, or behind a blind. And as far as
possible, he stayed outdoors. Expecting to die, instead he realized that he
was starting to feel better, and he too attributed his recovery to this fresh
air and rest; and he too felt that this was an experience that could be
generalized. </p>
<p>He became
increasingly interested in the medical literature on tuberculosis, and he read
about Brehmer and his sanatorium. But in the 1870s, there&#39;d been little
interest in the medical profession in the disease or in Brehmer&#39;s idea. The
1880s, because of Koch&#39;s major epoch-making discovery, however, created an
entirely different and more susceptive climate to the whole idea, and Trudeau
became an early convert to the idea of contagionism and the germ theory of
disease, with specific reference to tuberculosis. So, in 1884--this is a
statue of Edward Livingston Trudeau at Saranac Lake--he established Little Red,
which was the beginning of the sanatorium. This was in 1884, which is the
beginning then of the establishment of a small rest cottage, Little Red, for
the treatment of tuberculosis patients. </p>
<p>This is a picture of
Little Red, the first building in what becomes a much larger sanatorium. And
that&#39;s a picture of the inside of the sanatorium. There were several ideas
that Trudeau embodied in the sanatorium, and the first was that the sanatorium
was a means of treatment. And let&#39;s look at the treatment ideas that Trudeau
had in mind. The first was what he called the wilderness cure, the one that he
had experienced himself; that is to say, that you should live outdoors in all
weather, taking the cure on cottage porches. </p>
<p>And, so, there was a
document called &quot;The Rules for Patients at the Sanatorium at Saranac
Lake,&quot; and it said the following: &quot;Patients are expected to lead an
outdoor life, to remain eight to ten hours in the open air every day. Each
patient is required to be out of doors from 9:00 a.m. to 12:45 p.m., and again
from 2:00 p.m. to 5:45 every day. And sleeping out is considered in no way to
affect the requirement.&quot; So, the outdoor life was compulsory. Second was
rest. </p>
<p>The patients at
Saranac Lake were to have no exercise. A patient with a temperature of 99.5
degrees was allowed half an hour of exercise a day; and exercise included
standing up and getting dressed, or walking to the refectory for a meal, and
even getting in and out of bed was thought to be exercise. So, there was very
little that you were allowed to do. The third thing that was part of the
sanatorium regimen at Saranac Lake--and I&#39;m choosing Saranac Lake because this
was the model sanatorium that really became the ideal for an entire
international movement; thousands of sanatoria were founded on this model. </p>
<p>The third treatment
idea was a solid substantial diet, to combat the consumption, if you like, the
wasting away of the body, and to build resistance. In pursuit of that goal,
patients at Saranac Lake had four compulsory hardy meals a day, with milk
served in between, with a strong emphasis on meat and carbohydrates. The goal
was for the patient to consume 4,000 calories a day. Another point about the treatment
regimen is that the sanatorium was what we might call a total institution.
Unlike the old idea of taking the cure, at the sanatorium at Saranac Lake
patients were under constant vigilance. That was one of the reasons that you
kept them on the porches; on a porch you were constantly in view. And visitors
were strictly regulated. </p>
<p>The patients&#39; mail
was censored, the idea being that they should be sheltered from distressing
news and emotional shocks--those were not conducive to recovery. The rules,
therefore, stipulated that you weren&#39;t allowed, as a patient at Saranac Lake,
to discuss your disease, even with fellow patients at the sanatorium. The
rules also stated that there was to be no alcohol or tobacco; that there was to
be no socializing for more than an hour a day; and there were to be no indoor
visits from members of the opposite sex. You also--I&#39;m not sure of the medical
purpose of this, but these rules were enforced by expulsion. If you violated
the rules, you couldn&#39;t stay. And the rules also said that you couldn&#39;t
practice profanity. You weren&#39;t allowed to gamble. Those were part of the cure
as well. And the next idea of this was segregation; that is, I&#39;m not meaning
racial segregation now, I mean isolation. </p>
<p>There were individual
rooms, with porches, where patients were always out of doors. This is the
polar opposite of crowded conditions in tenements that were thought to be the
great means of spreading the tuberculosis epidemic. And Trudeau carried
out--there was an island. If you visit Saranac Lake, you&#39;ll notice that there
is an island which is called fondly Rabbit Island, in the center, where
Trudeau, during his self-imposed exile for the cure, had gone hunting and so
on. But he also conducted an experiment on Rabbit Island, and the experiment
consisted--I&#39;m not sure what you think of the robust scientific quality of it,
but it certainly convinced Edward Livingston Trudeau himself. </p>
<p>He took, I think, ten
rabbits onto Rabbit Island, and five of them were allowed to live free in good
outdoor conditions. The other five were put in artificial facsimiles of
tenement conditions; that is, they were confined to insalubrious, unsanitary,
crowded cardboard boxes. And at the end of a certain period, Trudeau noticed
that the five confined rabbits had died of tuberculosis, and the other five,
who were leading the hardy outdoor life, were a good advertisement for a
sanatorium and the outdoor cure. </p>
<p>Well, let&#39;s take a
little tour of this sanatorium. And we saw it started at Little Red, in very
humble beginnings. But then I say this was the total life. This was the
library. As you got better, you were allowed to do a little bit more, and you
could progress to the point where you&#39;d be allowed the strenuous exercise of
reading books in the sanatorium library. There was also the idea that this
would be an educational experience, and you would take back skills and
knowledge that would be essential to you after you had been discharged from the
sanatorium. And this is the workshop where you would learn skills or a craft
that you could exercise. Remember that you might still be something of an
invalid, and it would be important that you would have those sorts of skills
that you were capable of, a craft that you could carry out. </p>
<p>There was the chapel
at the sanatorium. Here is one of the pure cottages; and you&#39;ll note a
proliferation of porches at Saranac Lake. And these are more of the
buildings. This is the central administration. And here we actually see
patients doing what they did most of the time at Saranac Lake, and this is
taking the cure in the horizontal position and being watched. You were also
educated to use this little fashion accessory, which is your sputum cup. In
other words, your sputum was thought to be extremely dangerous and contagious,
and therefore you were not to spit on the ground but in this little cup. So,
the education of patients then, in contagionist theory, was a part of the
experience. They were issued with sputum cups, with handkerchiefs. </p>
<p>Spitting was strictly
forbidden at Saranac Lake, on pain of expulsion, and patients had severe
instructions to suppress their coughs whenever possible, and to cover their
faces when they did. So, Saranac Lake then was not just for its own patients.
It was also conceived of to spread the idea of the sanatorium as a model. And
Trudeau--and this was one of his great assets, he was really skilled at
publicity--he became a full-time agent for his own humanitarian project. Well,
the Saranac Lake Sanatorium then was a place of treatment and a place of
education. It was also a place of scientific research, featuring the science
of tuberculosis. </p>
<p>At Saranac Lake,
Trudeau founded the world&#39;s first laboratory devoted to the study of
tuberculosis, and Koch&#39;s techniques of microscopy, that Trudeau so much
admired, were followed and taught. Medical students were taught staining, the
culturing of bacteria, diagnosis, and there was a six-week course for already
qualified physicians for an internship, if you like, in the Saranac Lake
laboratory and at the sanatorium. And there were courses for nurses as well. </p>
<p>Well, what were the
results? Trudeau himself was very optimistic that this institution had
positive results for the health of his patients. He argued that normally an
active case of tuberculosis was almost universally fatal, but Trudeau, by
contrast, claimed that he achieved a recovery rate of about thirty percent.
And, so, he adopted, for Saranac Lake, a little slogan of his own, which was &quot;cure
sometimes, relief often, and comfort always.&quot; So, those were parts of the
mission of the Saranac Lake Sanatorium. We should also see it though as an
instrument of public health, based on the idea of the isolation of the
contagious. </p>
<p>Trudeau estimated
that each tuberculosis patient in a year, if he or she continued to live in an
urban environment, would on average infect another twenty people. So, we could
see the sanatorium as a kind of quarantine. And its particular idea was that
this was to remove working people, and people of modest means. In other words,
this first American sanatorium was a work of philanthropy. Patients, at
most--there was a sliding scale of expense, and patients were charged at most
half the cost of their stay and their treatment. And the endowment of the
sanatorium--because Trudeau was very effective at gaining approaching donors
and getting financial support for this idea--and, so, the endowment of the
sanatorium made up the difference. So, there was a considerable number then of
patients with no funds, who were subsidized by the institution. </p>
<p>Well, this went on as
well--we can see a relationship between tuberculosis also and, should we say,
economic development, in that the sanatorium became the centerpiece also for
the development of a town--that is, Saranac Lake as a town--which was based on
tuberculosis. And Edward Livingston Trudeau, in fact, was also the mayor of
the town. Well, initially those--we should remember that if you think getting
into Yale was difficult for you, getting a place at the Saranac Lake
Sanatorium, if you had tuberculosis, was even more difficult. There was a rate
of about 2,000 people applying for every place. </p>
<p>And, so, the city, or
Town of Saranac Lake, sprang up as a place where people could be taken care of,
who weren&#39;t admitted to the sanatorium itself. In other words, the town was
filled with cottages, with boardinghouses with cure porches, and the local
board of health, of the town, supervised and regulated what went on in these
cottages. There were district nurses who gave advice and monitored
conditions. And there was a Bureau of Information in the town, to assist
patients to find suitable arrangements. And then there were so-called
reception cottages, for patients so ill that they would be rejected by the sanatorium,
and by the boardinghouses even. </p>
<p>One of the features
of the sanatorium--it&#39;s difficult at Saranac Lake to determine the effect,
because there was considerable triage among those who were admitted. And one
of the features of it was that Trudeau didn&#39;t wish to take people into the
sanatorium whom he considered so ill that nothing more could be done for them.
He wanted people who would actually benefit from his cure. So, in that sense,
the statistics were a little bit massaged by the fact that the most serious
cases of tuberculosis didn&#39;t figure in them.</p>
<p>Well, the idea of the
sanatorium spread, and spread rapidly. It wasn&#39;t long before every state in
the nation had a network of sanatoria. And some of them were specialized: some
for the indigent, that is, the poor; some for women; some for
African-Americans. Abroad, there were also sanatoria, the most famous in
Switzerland, in Davos--you can read about it in Thomas Mann&#39;s <i>The Magic
Mountain</i>--and that was clearly a sanatorium that wasn&#39;t subsidized but was,
in fact, for the social elite. So, there were also sanatoria of various types,
for various social classes and social groupings. There were also distinctions
within the movement in the sanatorium idea. </p>
<p>In England, for
example, they shared the idea of the importance of the outdoor life, diet and
surveillance, but they differed in that they thought that the kind of rest
regimen that Trudeau had in mind was counterproductive, and that this would
ruin working people, who would get used to a life of idleness. So, in England
the sanatoria instead practiced what was called graduated exercise, and instead
of the rest treatment we have the work treatment. And those of you who are
skiers know that the slopes are given color codes: your black diamonds, your
blue and your green, for example. Well, at the British sanatoria, there were
walks for the patients, and they were also color coded according to difficulty
and how much it was going to make you breathe. And inmates then--as you got
well, you were encouraged to take walks of progressive difficulty. </p>
<p>In the inter-war
period, there were some additional innovations in the treatment of
tuberculosis. One was--this is still before the age of antibiotics, you
see--and one was a surgical approach. And this was practiced at Saranac Lake
as well, the idea being to extend rest to have real, total rest of the lungs.
This was termed artificial pneumothorax; and that means that air was injected,
or another gas, like nitrogen, into the pleural cavity to collapse the lung, or
the lungs, by subjecting it or them to external pressure. The procedure was
developed in the 1890s, and came into vogue after World War I, especially in
this country. Very invasively, some surgeons even decided to make the collapse
permanent by removing patients&#39; ribs to paralyze the diaphragm. </p>
<p>Let me show you--this
is a patient undergoing pneumothorax, the artificial collapse of the lung. And
this is a diagram of the pneumothorax apparatus. The remark of one surgeon was
this, in a burst of surgical optimism. He said, &quot;Physicians have treated
tuberculosis for 2,000 years, and without effect. It&#39;s time now for us
surgeons to show the way.&quot; The analogy was that of the resting of a
broken limb in a cast. Unfortunately, however, statistics seemed to indicate
that the results were deeply disappointing, and the procedure was almost
totally abandoned by 1940. </p>
<p>Fortunately, however,
there were other weapons in the war on tuberculosis. One was another
institution, in addition to the sanatoria, and that&#39;s the dispensaries. In
cities to which patients returned, after discharge from hospitals and
sanatoria, they needed follow-up care, and the dispensaries were designed to
provide that in the community. They also taught hygienic education, reminding
patients that even after discharge from the sanatoria, they still weren&#39;t
allowed to spit, and they should cover up their faces when coughing or
sneezing, and they should tell everyone in their families to do the same. So,
these were, in part, health education facilities. </p>
<p>They also performed
what we might call social work services. They helped recovering patients to
find jobs that were suitable for their condition. Sometimes they provided
loans or cash grants, or food to tide patients over while they attempted to get
back on their feet, after a prolonged period of being unemployed. There were
also--these were joined by campaigning voluntary associations. And, so, we see
a proliferation of what we might now call NGOs. In England was the National
Association for the Prevention of Consumption and Other Forms of Tuberculosis,
founded in 1898. And there were similar associations in France, Germany,
Belgium, Portugal, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Japan, Norway, Australia.
And in our country there was the National Tuberculosis Association, that&#39;s now
called the American Lung Association. And I wonder if you could guess who its
first president was? Well your friend, Edward Livingston Trudeau. I said he
was a propagandist of genius. </p>
<p>The mission of these
associations again was to educate the public about the disease, to help teach
people in how they could protect themselves from it, and also protect those
around them. And they spent a lot of time attacking the social construction of
tuberculosis from the first half of the nineteenth century; that is, the
romantic idea of tuberculosis. They stressed, in pamphlets and in lectures,
that tuberculosis was neither romantic nor poetic. One pamphlet wrote--and I
think it laid it on a bit a heavy--it said, &quot;TB is a coarse, common,
vulgar disease, bred in foul breath, in dirt and squalor. The beautiful and
the rich receive it from the unbeautiful and from the poor.&quot; I think
we&#39;re a million miles away from <i>La Boh</i><i>è</i><i>me</i>. </p>
<p>In any case, the idea
then was to frighten people in order to reform their habits. And these
associations produced pamphlets. They sponsored lectures. There were
traveling exhibits. Later on there were films and radio broadcasts, newspaper
articles. And the propaganda blanketed schools and hospitals, offices and
shops, factories, town halls, billing places, public squares, city walls,
bulletin boards at schools and universities. And particular targets were the
habit of spitting and alcoholism. You would&#39;ve noted, not too many years ago, that
if you boarded a bus, say in Paris or in Rome, that the back of the bus would
have a sign <i>D</i><i>é</i><i>fense de crecher</i>; &quot;no spitting&quot; in
French. Or <i>Vietato sputare</i>, in Italian. </p>
<p>Spitting was really
something that this campaign heavily focused on. In addition, there were other
messages: the outdoor life and exercise. It wasn&#39;t unrelated that this was the
time when the Scout movement gets going, to give people outdoor experience, so
that they&#39;ll be more healthy. It sponsored playgrounds at schools, and parks in
cities and urban areas, and also the movement funded research in the basic
sciences related to tuberculosis. So, that was part of this campaign, the war
on tuberculosis. In addition, there were government measures. One was a
campaign--I said that a secondary way in which tuberculosis was spread was
through milk. And, so, in this period we see the attempt to screen herds, to
prevent diseased milk and meat from reaching the market, and it was the time
when the pasteurization of milk took off as a practice. </p>
<p>Tuberculosis also, by
states, municipalities and nations, was made a notifiable disease. The pioneer
here was New York City in 1897. Manchester in England followed suit in 1899,
and then there was a cascade of other places where physicians were obligated to
report cases to the authorities. Now, a result--this clearly is a positive
thing in that public health depends on accurate information and you can only
get information through statistics. So, I don&#39;t want to argue that this was
anything but positive. Except, as many positive measures have, it also had a
small undertow; in other words, this increased the fear of the disease. People
feared being reported, because they might lose their jobs. They would lose all
standing in the marriage market. They might be shunned by anxious friends,
neighbors and relatives. </p>
<p>Another idea was
vaccination, and this was followed from 1925--well 1908, in particular, but
especially after 1925--with the BCG first, and vaccination with attenuated
bacteria thereafter, not with a very successful result. But this was part of
the policy as well. And then there was mass screening through radiology and
the tuberculosis skin test. Well, how effective was the war on tuberculosis
with this set of tools used to combat the disease? Interestingly, I think one
could argue that the war on tuberculosis really gathered speed, not at the very
height of the tuberculosis epidemic, when there was the most suffering,
morbidity and mortality. </p>
<p>The decline probably
began spontaneously somewhat earlier, maybe reflecting the sanitarian movement,
and improved urban living conditions, improved wages and diet, improved
housing; things that were done spontaneously, and led to a recession of the
disease by those sorts of means. But everyone agrees that sanatoria and
isolation did reduce infection; that dispensaries and TB campaigning
organizations provided those at risk with means to protect themselves. So,
they undoubtedly did have an important effect on tuberculosis, and we can see a
decline in the disease in the early decades of the twentieth century. But the
real massive decline began in what we might call the antibiotic era, from 1940
to 1980, roughly. </p>
<p>Here a major event, a
new magic bullet, was devised by Selman Waksman in 1943, at Rutgers University;
that is, the development of streptomycin. And the first patient to be treated
with it, tuberculosis patient, was 1944, when a critically ill TB patient made
a full recovery, what seemed truly a miracle cure. And this led, immediately
after World War II, to a confident expectation--and we&#39;ll see this repeated in
a number of different fields and with regard to a series of diseases, the idea
that worldwide eradication was just around the corner. And there was--in fact,
it was fueled by a constant decline, from the 1950s to the mid-1980s in
tuberculosis. In the USA, there was a seventy-five percent decline. There
were 80,000 cases in 1954; 20,000 only in 1985. And the government confidently
predicted eradication by 2010--something that you know didn&#39;t happen--and
worldwide by 2025. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a
troubling problem rapidly emerged. First there was monotherapy, that is,
streptomycin, and soon it happened, it was discovered, that bacteria were
becoming resistant to it. For a time the problem was overcome by combination
treatments; two, three medications at once, instead of monotherapy. Isoniazid
was developed in 1952, rifampicin in 1963. But then the problem increased with
multiple-drug-resistant tuberculosis. And in 1985, there was a halt in the
decline; 1986 and &#39;7 a slight rise; and after 1987, a rise in the United States,
but even more troubling, a pandemic in Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and
Sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, in 1993, the World Health Organization took the
step, for the first time, of proclaiming the TB pandemic a world emergency, and
warned that the disease might spiral out of control. </p>
<p>Today there are
perhaps worldwide some 8,000,000 people who develop active infections every
year, and a million, over a million people die. Well, what are some of the
factors in this resurgent emergency? One, of course, is poverty. Tuberculosis
thrives in the conditions promoted by poverty, and worldwide the nations with
the highest incidence of TB, not by accident, are those with the lowest gross
national product. If we look at the United States, we can confirm this
picture, in that seventy percent of cases in the United States occur among
racial and ethnic minorities; forty percent among immigrants from abroad, or
what we might call marginal groups: intravenous drug users, prisoners, the
homeless, people in nursing homes for the elderly, or people with compromised
immune systems due to HIV/AIDS. </p>
<p>Remember, of course,
that in an era of air travel our country isn&#39;t an island and can&#39;t reduce its
own burden of tuberculosis without also dealing with the global emergency.
There were other factors that have fed into this upsurge: the displacement of
people due to war, or economic disaster, or environmental catastrophes.
Remember, of course, that refugee camps are wonderful for propagating
tuberculosis. And then there&#39;s the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the upsurge in
malaria. Both of those diseases are immunosuppressive, and both act as
powerful substrata for the emergence of tuberculosis. Indeed, TB is the
leading immediate cause of death among AIDS sufferers. Tuberculosis is the
perfect opportunistic disease. </p>
<p>Then there&#39;s the
problem of the emergence of drug resistance that we referred to, and that has
fed the pandemic. High rates of incarceration feed the pandemic; that&#39;s been
clearly demonstrated in Russia, the former Soviet Union, and in our own
country. And in Russia, the collapse of medical services in Eastern Europe.
And then, of course, there&#39;s the availability of mass air travel. Well I just
wanted to close with the fact that we&#39;re then in the midst of this world
pandemic. And I wanted to say also that there are a number of issues about
tuberculosis, historically and medically, that still need to be worked out. </p>
<p>It&#39;s not understood
what factors cause it to pass from the dormant state to an active infection.
It&#39;s not known why in some people it&#39;s a fulminant disease, but in others a
slow, wasting process. It&#39;s not known why it chooses to invade certain tissues
and organs, rather than others. It&#39;s not really clear why in the middle
decades of the nineteenth century it disproportionately affected women, whereas
from the late nineteenth century it tended to favor men. And it&#39;s not entirely
clear what were the factors that caused this major recession of the disease
between the 1890s and 1985; although we&#39;ve dealt with quite a number of them:
spontaneous economic advance; improvement in living conditions; government and
NGO campaigns; the reporting of the disease; the sanatorium movement; and then
finally the development of antibiotics. </p>
<p>So, that&#39;s the
tuberculosis story, from the age of consumption down to where we are today;
which today we find ourselves in a very problematic condition with regard to
what has been this terrible upsurge of a disease that defeated the confident
expectation that it would soon be eradicated. </p>
