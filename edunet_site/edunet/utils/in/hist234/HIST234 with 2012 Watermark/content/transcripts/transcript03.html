<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden: </b>Well,
what we&#39;ll do this morning is to start right now. And we&#39;ll be dealing today
with the beginnings of our first major epidemic in the course. We&#39;ll be
talking about bubonic plague. This time we&#39;ll have an overview of bubonic
plague and its passage through Western society. And then in the next two
classes we&#39;ll look at specific features of bubonic plague; next time, community
responses to the plague, and the time after that, the impact on society, and in
particular on European culture. So, that&#39;s where we&#39;re headed. And this
morning we&#39;ll have a sort of overview. </p>
<p>Now, one of the
reasons for dealing first with the plague is that it&#39;s very important as part
of testing the theme of our course; the theme being--one of the themes--that
epidemic diseases aren&#39;t just interchangeable causes of illness and death; that
each one has its own particular history that is determined by a number of
variables that we&#39;ll be looking at, such as virulence, the nature of the
symptoms of the disease, and a number of others. And we&#39;ll be testing the
theory too that epidemic diseases are major determinants of historical change,
and have major impacts on society. </p>
<p>Well, plague, in a
sense, set the standard by which all other epidemics are judged. The plague
was, we might call it, the worst-case scenario, and we&#39;ll see that in later
centuries, when societies experienced some new and unfamiliar disease, they
waited anxiously to see if those diseases would be similar in their impact.
And especially terrible diseases like cholera, in the nineteenth century, and
influenza, just after the First World War, were said to be &quot;the return of
the plague.&quot; Tuberculosis, the great killer of the nineteenth century,
was known also as &quot;the white plague.&quot; </p>
<p>What were some of the
distinctive features of bubonic plague? The first thing that stands out is its
extreme virulence. That&#39;s one of the first words that we may want to define as
we move on. By that I mean its capacity to cause harm and symptoms in the
human body. It&#39;s a measurement of the ability of a pathogen to cause disease. Plague
in that sense was highly virulent. It also struck rapidly. It caused
excruciating and degrading symptoms, and it achieved a case fatality
rate--another technical term, which simply means the kill rate that a disease
achieved. In the case of bubonic plague, it normally killed fifty to seventy
percent of the patients it infected; a rate attained by few other diseases.
Its course in the human body was also terrifyingly swift. Normally it killed
within about three days of the first appearance of symptoms. </p>
<p>Another feature that
was characteristic of bubonic plague was the profile of its victims. I mean
that both in terms of their age and their social class. Familiar endemic
childhood diseases in a society tend to strike primarily children and the
elderly. That, if you like, would be the normal experience of society with
infectious diseases. But the plague was different. It struck men and women in
the prime of life. And this fact, among others, made plague seem like an
unnatural, or might we say supernatural, event. It also magnified the economic
and social dislocations it caused. In other words, plague left in its wake
vast numbers of orphans, widows and destitute families. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the
plague, unlike most epidemic diseases, did not show a predilection for the
poor. It struck universally, again magnifying a sense that this was the final
day of reckoning, a divine visitation. Another feature of plague we&#39;ll be
looking at is terror as a response to it. All of the things that we&#39;ll be
saying about plague magnified the responses of the societies that were
afflicted. Plague was associated with mass hysteria; with terror; with
violence; with religious revivals, as people sought to assuage the divine
wrath. It was associated with scapegoating and witch-hunts, for the guilty
people in society responsible for the disaster. Perhaps those were the sinful,
for those who saw the disease as divine retribution. Or it could be a search
for the homicidal agents of some human conspiracy, for the demonic
interpretation of disease. Those might be foreigners, witches, Jews or
poisoners. </p>
<p>Then the plague was
important because it generated a major societal response: the development of
the first forms of public health. In part because of its very virulence, the
plague inspired the first and most extreme form of public health policy to
protect populations and contain the spread of this horrendous and terrible
disease. Plague public health--and we&#39;ll see this more next time--involved a
military style policy carried out by the army and the navy. It involved
maritime and land-based quarantines, sanitary cordons, which are military lines
isolating a population. It gave rise to pest houses or lazarettos. And to new
health authorities--variously called, over the centuries, health magistrates or
boards of health--equipped with extraordinary powers to enforce the plague
measures. In some places there were erected stocks and scaffolds to remind the
population of the powers of these authorities. </p>
<p>Early Italian states,
at the time of the Renaissance, devoted a special role--deserved a special role
as the inventors of these public health measures. This was thrust upon them by
their vulnerable position at the geographic center of trade routes in the
Mediterranean. So, we&#39;ll see the decisive role in the development of these
measures was played by places like Florence and the great port cities like
Genoa, Naples, Venice. Later centuries will see another pattern, when a new,
mysterious and frightful disease strikes--say cholera, yellow fever or
AIDS--one of the first responses of authorities is to return to plague measures
of self-defense. </p>
<p>It&#39;s said of generals
that they always try to fight the last war over again, often confronting new
enemies with inappropriate strategies. The same might be said of public health
authorities over the centuries. And this temptation is all the greater for
authorities because the battery of anti-plague defenses gives an impression of
taking forceful and decisive action; providing the population, in other words,
with some sense of security. </p>
<p>A third feature of
the plague is its enormous impact on society. As we&#39;ve said, infectious
diseases are not narrow, specialized interests. They&#39;re often part of the big
picture, as essential for understanding a society and its history as studying
war, religion, economics, high politics and culture. I&#39;m not trying to make a
case for disease determinism, and I&#39;m not what you might want to call a
microbial Marxist. My argument instead is simply that certain diseases do have
a transforming effect on society, plague being one of them. Certain others do
not, even great killers such as polio or influenza. We&#39;re going to examine why
this major difference--why some diseases have a much more lasting footprint
than others.</p>
<p>Bubonic plague was a
disease that affected every aspect of society. It transformed the demography
of Europe. Recurring cycles of plague, with an epidemic every generation,
constituted a major break on population between the fourteenth century and the
eighteenth. It had devastating effect on economic life and economic growth.
It also had a major impact on religion and popular culture. It gave rise to a
new piety, to cults of plague saints, to passion plays. Plague led to an
outpouring of sermons and religious pamphlets, with a central theme being what
we might call theodicy; that is, how do you justify God&#39;s ways towards men? </p>
<p>A just and loving God
could be angry and punish sinners who turned from him and disobeyed. But how
were priests and ministers to explain the gruesome suffering and death of
innocents, and in particular of children? Thus also we see another undertow.
We talked about piety. I would argue that plague also led sometimes to its
opposite; the terrifying conclusion that how could there be a good God, because
a loving and all-powerful being would not take the lives of half the population
of a great city, indiscriminately killing men, women and children. So, for
some, the result wasn&#39;t an act of atheism but a mute despair that was not
articulated; a psychological impact that with historical hindsight we might
even call post-traumatic stress. </p>
<p>So, plague had a
major psychological impact on the relationship of human beings to their
mortality, and to their god. Plague had a major impact on the arts and
culture. In literature we&#39;ll be seeing--and in fact you&#39;re starting to see, I
hope already, by reading Defoe--that there&#39;s a whole genre of plague
literature, including not only Defoe but names like Boccaccio, Camus, Manzoni;
of whom more later. It affected European painting profoundly, and we&#39;ll be
looking at that. It affected architecture, with large numbers of churches
dedicated to the redeemer and the plague saints. It led to sculpture, and
plague columns appeared throughout Vienna and the Austrian cities. We have,
even in modern times, the film that I hope you&#39;ll be seeing, <i>The Seventh
Seal</i> by Bergman.</p>
<p>Plague also had a
major impact intellectually on the medical paradigm of disease. Plague
profoundly tested the humoral framework of disease. And we can see this in a
man I mentioned in the last lecture, Girolamo Fracastoro, who developed a
theory of contagionism. Now, the humoral idea, and Hippocrates, had recognized
the difficulty that epidemics pose for humoral theory. How is it possible to
account for vast numbers of people experiencing the same humoral imbalance at
precisely the same time? Well, Fracastoro took that idea and he eliminated the
mediation of the humors, suggesting instead that the disease was caused by a
poisonous chemical, transmitted in a way he didn&#39;t understand, from one person
to another. But let&#39;s not think of Fracastoro as a modern medical scientist.
He thought that plague was caused, not by a living entity, but by a chemical. </p>
<p>That&#39;s the background,
then. Let&#39;s remember the history of three pandemics of bubonic plague that
afflicted the West. Now, first maybe we should define what we mean. An
outbreak--let&#39;s talk about three terms--an outbreak, an epidemic and a
pandemic. An outbreak is a small surge in morbidity and mortality in a
locality. So, we might talk of an outbreak of influenza in New Haven. An
epidemic is a much bigger surge, over a larger area. And a pandemic is when an
epidemic goes transnational; becomes an international phenomenon, affecting
whole continents, or occasionally going global. The plague struck the West in three
pandemic waves. </p>
<p>We&#39;ll be talking
about the history, then, of three pandemics of bubonic plague. And each
pandemic as a subset, if we like, had a series of recurring visitations that
might even last for centuries. And in addition to being cyclical in that
sense, plague had a pronounced seasonality. An epidemic of bubonic plague
usually began in the spring or summer months, and faded away with the coming of
winter. Especially favorable were months that were both hot and wet. The
explanation for that, as we&#39;ll see, wasn&#39;t a humoral one. But that provides an
ideal environment for fleas, which are decisive in plague, and their need for
warmth and humidity, for their eggs to hatch; and they become inactive in cold
or very dry climate. </p>
<p>The first pandemic,
when was that? That lasted for two centuries after 541 A.D., and is called the
Plague of Justinian. It was the first appearance of bubonic plague as a major
player in world history, and there are estimates that it afflicted Africa, Asia
and Europe with--people are guessing, but there are figures bandied about of
perhaps a hundred million victims. There are few accounts, or records that
have survived, and there&#39;s some debate about whether this so-called Plague of
Justinian was even bubonic plague at all, or whether it was some other
disease. But as we speak, paleopathologists are at work exhuming bodies from
ancient cemeteries in order to find conclusive DNA evidence to support a firm
diagnosis, and the latest news is that they&#39;re pretty certain that it was
bubonic plague. </p>
<p>The second pandemic
occurred from the 1330s, in the Middle East, until the 1830s. So, we
have--what&#39;s that?--five centuries of bubonic plague in the second pandemic.
It began with what was called the Black Death. This erupted in Central Asia in
the 1330s, and first invaded Europe in 1347. And the early years, from 1347
into the 1350s, were usually called the Black Death, which referred to the
first wave of the second pandemic; after which it&#39;s usually referred to simply
as bubonic plague, plague, or pestilence. It may well--and this is the common
theory--have arrived aboard a Genoese merchant ship that had sailed from the
Black Sea in the summer of 1347. </p>
<p>In any case, Italy
was the first land to be invaded by the disease; again, as I say, not by
chance, because Italy was at the center of the trade routes of the
Mediterranean, and therefore was always, at this time, permanently at risk.
About a third of the population of Europe is estimated to have perished. And
after the 1350s, after the Black Death, the plague returned more or less once
in a generation, for a number of centuries, with some famous local epidemics.
Let me just remember some of the worst cases. Florence in 1348, when the
disease killed half the population--and that&#39;s portrayed vividly in Boccaccio&#39;s
<i>Decameron</i>; 1576 to 1577, Milan; 1630, again Milan--and there are two
major plague works of literature: Manzoni&#39;s novel <i>The Betrothed</i>, and his
work <i>The Column of Infamy</i>--1656 in Naples; and 1665 and 1666 in London,
which you&#39;re reading about in Dafoe&#39;s <i>Journal of the Plague Year</i>. </p>
<p>Then for reasons
we&#39;re going to return to, the plague was vanquished in Western Europe between
the end of the seventeenth century and the middle of the eighteenth. The last
outbreaks in Western Europe, of the second pandemic, were 1720 to 1722, at
Marseilles in France, the last on the Western European mainland; and in 1743 at
Messina and Sicily. Interestingly, Messina is a convenient bookend; the very
first place in Western Europe to be afflicted by the plague, and also the last,
during the second pandemic. Now, don&#39;t make the mistake of assuming that the
virulence of the plague declines over these centuries. In many cases the last
epidemics of the seventeenth or eighteenth century were the most devastating of
all, including the experience of London that you&#39;re reading about. </p>
<p>Then we come to the
third pandemic, which lasted from about 1855 until 1959, more or less, when it
fades away. It began in earnest, and attracted world attention in China, when
it attacked Hong Kong and Canton in 1894. And, as I said, it lasted until the
middle of the twentieth century. Now, this pandemic ravaged India and affected
five countries, but mostly not the industrial West, apart from a brief flare-up
in Naples in 1899, and an also limited outbreak in San Francisco in the early
years of the twentieth century. That&#39;s the topic of Marilyn Chase&#39;s work that
you&#39;ll be reading, <i>The Barbary Plague</i>. It was the steamship that
enabled plague to reach the New World for the first time in the twentieth
century. It had limited impact on humans, but it did establish a stable
reservoir of infection among wild rodents in the southwest of the United
States, where it persists to this very day and causes an ongoing trickle of
cases of bubonic plague in this country.</p>
<p>The great disaster
was India from 1898 to 1908, which experienced some 13 million deaths from the
bubonic plague. Present day plague--and I think a number of you may have the
idea that plague is something medieval that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with
the modern world, and I want to make it clear that plague is not extinct.
Indeed, I have a friend myself who is a survivor of bubonic plague, which she
contracted in Arizona in the southwest. As I said, it continues to cause a
trickle of cases every year in the United States, because it persists in the
wild animal population, and there are occasional flare-ups. </p>
<p>We also need to
remember there&#39;s a somber background threat, then, of bubonic plague even
today, which is made more vivid by the threat possibly of bubonic plague as an
instrument of bio-terror. And just to show the sort of modern--here&#39;s a modern
image of the grim reaper as still with us. Now, our focus here in our class
will be instead firmly on the second pandemic, and especially its last terrible
century in Europe, the seventeenth. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s talk about some
of the features of bubonic plague, and we&#39;ll begin with its etiology. Again a
bit of jargon, and by that I simply mean the causes or origins of the disease.
And the plague is a disease with a complex history of four protagonists. First
there&#39;s the bacterium--and there it is--<i>Yersinia pestis</i>, sometimes
called, in a more old-fashioned way, <i>Pasteurella pestis</i>. It was
discovered in Hong Kong by Alexander Yersin, a Swiss student of Louis Pasteur,
and at the same time by his rival the Japanese physician, Shibasaburo Kitasato,
a protégé instead of Robert Koch. </p>
<p>So, the first
protagonist is this bacterium, <i>Yersinia pestis</i>. And then there are two
vectors. The vector is normally another bit of jargon: An animal or insect
responsible for conveying a disease to human beings. And in this case there
are two vectors or carriers that convey the disease to human beings: fleas and
rodents, especially rats. And then there&#39;s the fourth protagonist, you and
me. By between 1894 and 1898, Yersin and his colleague, Paul-Louis Simond,
unraveled the complex relationship among rats, fleas and humans, and the
bacterium, that governs the epidemiology of bubonic plague. </p>
<p>Normally the plague
began as an infection, an epidemic among animals and especially wild rodents:
hamsters, gerbils, prairie dogs, chipmunks, squirrels in their burrows, where
underground catastrophes, unknown to humans, took place. A particularly important
moment was when it inflicted this particular creature and friend, that lives
not so distant from us, <i>Rattus rattus</i>, the black rat or ship rat; and as
you see, extremely cute it is. Unlike his cousin, the brown rat, that took
over its ecological niche later on, and is more familiar in modern times, the
black rat was definitely not shy, but lived in close proximity to people, with
whom they shared the same dietary preferences. So, the rat was extremely
important. </p>
<p>The bacterium was
spread in a third major character, the flea, a highly efficient vector for
bubonic plague. The flea is naturally parasitic on warm-blooded animals. In a
single feed it sucks up an amount of blood equal to its own weight. I&#39;m
talking about something like a billion bacteria at a time. And here we&#39;re
looking at the slide of a flea engorged with blood after a meal. Now, once
infected--and here you&#39;ll feel sorry for the poor flea--the flea does not
survive the plague either. The bacterium blocks the gut of the flea, causing it
to starve to death. Poor thing. But before dying, in a frenzied bid to
survive, the flea feeds repeatedly, and in each bite inoculates perhaps a
hundred thousand bacteria into the bloodstream of its warm-blooded victim. </p>
<p>So, when a rodent
host of fleas sickens and dies, the fleas leap to the warm body of another
mammal that passes within leaping radius. And the flea also is capable of
hibernating for as much as a couple of months, lying in wait. Now, how did
human beings come to be involved in this catastrophe? Well, it might be
sometimes that the remote steppes where wild rodents lived had their ecological
systems disrupted, perhaps by floods or droughts, that sent animals scurrying
over long distances, and then they encountered other rodents who lived in close
proximity to man, and especially our friend the black rat. Alternatively,
human beings invaded rodents&#39; habitats, exposing themselves to infection;
soldiers perhaps, or refugees in times of war, or hunters and shepherds. </p>
<p>So, the first foci--that
is, the first locuses where infections sprang up amongst human beings--were the
first infected men and women which shared their fleas and infection with other
members of their household. The plague would then begin, not as a disease so
much of isolated individuals, but of households. Housing conditions were
important. Overcrowding, with whole families sleeping in a single bed,
facilitated the exchange of fleas. And there were particular moments that were
especially dangerous, such as the laying out and final attentions to the
dead. As the body cooled, the fleas infesting it became desperate to escape
to the next warm body that approached; quite possibly you and me. </p>
<p>Then there was the
wider spread; and this was dependent on networks of trade and commerce. It was
not an accident that plague emerged when it did in European history. It spread
overland and along river valleys, by river traffic. Now, fleas obviously are
severely restricted in their range, but rats are really wonderful travelers. They
hide in the shipments of wheat and are transported overland. They travel by
barge down waterways. But the garments of victims were also important, because
they were recycled. Remember how precious an item of clothing was in the early
modern world. And, so, the clothing of dead men and women was packed in
crates, and sold in markets and fairs, often with fleas intact among their
folds. </p>
<p>Certain professions
were also highly at risk: street vendors, market-stall-holders, washerwomen,
gravediggers, physicians, priests, and also millers and bakers, because of the
dietary preferences of your friend the black rat. But the disease also went
further afield, and it did so by sea. And shipping was essential to the spread
of the plague over long distance, and helps to explain its epidemiology; its
tendency, that is, to arrive in a country first by striking port cities, and
only then moving inland by road and river traffic. Infected rats would clamor
aboard ships, by ropes and gangplanks, or they could be lifted aboard in crates
of grain or shipments of clothes. </p>
<p>Istanbul was a great
hub of trade in the Middle East, and it linked the rest of the Mediterranean
world by trade overland across the Balkans, and by ship to Venice, Naples,
Genoa, Marseilles, Valencia. Sometimes there was havoc at sea when a whole
crew and its passengers would be killed by the plague before they arrived at
port, and there were ghost ships that floated on the Mediterranean. Once
reaching a port, however, the ship would dock and rats would disembark, in
crates, or by rope, or by the gangplank again, and at the same time infected
passengers and crew could go ashore, together with their fleas. Normally the
first indication of plague--one that&#39;s dramatically apparent in Camus&#39; novel <i>The
Plague</i>, but we&#39;ll also see in some of the paintings that we&#39;ll look at time
after next--an important indication was a sudden and massive die-off of rats.
And there would be pictures like this of rats killed by an epidemic of bubonic
plague; in this case Sydney, Australia. </p>
<p>So, ports are crucial
in epidemics, and in the development of public health measures to counter
them. Almost invariably in Western Europe the plague arrived in port cities
and then spread inland, following roads and rivers. In the large cities, the
disease typically would arrive in the spring, reach a peak of ferocity after a
few weeks, then continue as a violent outbreak for two to four months, and then
decline with the coming of colder, dry weather, either to disappear entirely,
or to be rekindled when favorable climatic conditions returned. </p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s the
etiology, in a nutshell, of the plague. I&#39;d like to turn now to its
symptomatology and pathology; that is, how does it affect the individual human
body? And the study of the symptoms of the epidemics we study isn&#39;t just a
matter of ghoulish curiosity. I&#39;m going to argue that the history of each
epidemic disease is distinct. That&#39;s one of the reasons that I will be showing
slides, to fix the image of a particular disease in your mind. Because it&#39;s
important not to confuse them, because each has its own history. And a crucial
variable is the differing way in which each of these diseases affected its
victims. </p>
<p>A feature of the
plague, I would argue, is that it seemed almost purposefully designed to
maximize terror. I will be showing you some vivid material, and I&#39;m sorry that
it&#39;s just before lunch. And indeed a couple of years ago in this class someone
in the front row fainted with some of the pictures. So, if you don&#39;t wish to
look at them, I can tell you in advance it&#39;s not compulsory. You can simply
close your eyes. In any case, <i>Yersinia pestis </i>is exceptionally virulent
because of its ability to overwhelm the immune system of the body. After an
infective bite, there&#39;s an incubation period, usually of one to six days, and
then the classic symptoms appear--the first beginning--launching the first
stage of bubonic plague. </p>
<p>That is, at the site
of the flea bite, there&#39;s what&#39;s called a carbuncle or gangrenous black
blister, surrounded by red pot marks. And this will be familiar to you because
it&#39;s been immortalized in the nursery rhyme, &quot;The Ring a Ring o&#39;
Roses.&quot; But also, along with it, there&#39;s high temperature and shivering,
violent headache, nausea and vomiting, and general flu-like symptoms; after
which the patient passes on to the second stage of bubonic plague, when it
invades--the bacteria invade the lymph system and drain into the lymph nodes. </p>
<p>A couple of days
later a so-called bubo--which gives the symptom that gives the disease its
name, bubonic plague--the plague of buboes appears. This is an infected
swelling of the lymph nodes, a hard mass the size of an orange beneath the
skin. The site of the bubo varies, according to the location of the infective
bite. If a flea bites the legs, the bubo is usually in the groin, and would
look like that. If the fleas instead were to bite the arms, the bubo would
appear in the armpit or on the neck, and there would be symptoms--would look
like this, or like that. In any case, Daniel Defoe imagined, and he writes in
our book, that the agony was so violent from the bubo that victims hurled
themselves from roofs, or into the Thames to escape it. And there was a
general consensus that the body and all of its excretions--urine, sweat, the
breath--had an overpowering stench.</p>
<p>This led--I want us
to remember how dehumanizing the symptoms of plague were, and that&#39;s
tremendously important to the way that societies experienced its outbreak. In
the third stage, the bacteria releases a powerful toxin, and this circulates
throughout the bloodstream, and it&#39;s the toxin that kills. It attacks tissues,
causing blood vessels to hemorrhage, and giving rise to purpurous, subcutaneous
spots, the so-called tokens of plague. Another bit of jargon to remember. The
plague is associated with tokens and these--let&#39;s have a look at--which look
like this. They gain their name because they were thought by many to be the
signs, that is the tokens, of God&#39;s anger, the anger that led him to smite his
people with the plague. </p>
<p>The toxin initiates
the septic phase of this disease, causing rapid degeneration of the muscles of
the heart, of the kidneys, of the nerves and the central nervous system, and
this leads to such symptoms as bloodshot eyes, general prostration, fever,
nausea, severe headache, and progressive neurological damage that&#39;s manifested
by slurred speech, a staggering gait, psychic disturbances and derangement. We
again see how this disease is terrifyingly dehumanizing and agonizing. And it leads
then to delirium and coma. Sometimes it also causes gangrene of the
extremities--and I will also have a picture of that--and this may, in fact, be
the origin of the term Black Death. </p>
<p>Now, in terms of the
symptomatology--let me pass on from that to this. This is a Franciscan friar,
Michael of Piazza, a chronicler--you&#39;ll remember I said Messina was the first
place to be afflicted by bubonic plague in 1347. He wrote this terrifying
description of how it afflicted a sufferer. He wrote: &quot;Not only did the
burned blisters appear, but there developed in different parts of the body
gland boils; in some on the sexual organs. In others&quot;--whoops, sorry,
there we go--&quot;In others on the arms or the neck. At first these were the
size of a hazelnut and developed accompanied by violent shivering fits that
soon rendered those attacked so weak they could no longer stand upright, but
were forced to lie in their beds, consumed by violent fever and overcome by
great tribulation. Soon the boils grew to the size of a walnut, then a hen&#39;s
egg, and they were exceedingly painful and irritated the body, causing it to
vomit blood by vitiating the juices. The blood rose from the affected lungs to
the throat, producing on the whole body a putrefying and decomposing effect. The
sickness lasted three days, and on the fourth, at the latest, the patient
succumbed.&quot; </p>
<p>So, as soon as anyone
was seized with headache and shivering, he knew that he was bound to pass away
within the specified time, and first confessed his sins to the priest, and then
made his will. Death occurred in about half of cases within a few days, though
some of the afflicted lingered in agony for as long as three to four weeks, and
then a minority slowly recovered. </p>
<p>The symptoms of
bubonic plague are agonizing. They&#39;re terrifying, dehumanizing, as suffers
succumb to hallucinations and delirium. Now, there are three forms of bubonic
plague, and I want to mention what those are immediately. These are not three
separate diseases. They&#39;re one disease in three separate manifestations. The
first is what we&#39;ve been describing as classic bubonic plague, the most common
and historically most important form. Then there&#39;s septicemic plague, which is
an overwhelming infection in which the patient frequently dies, even before
developing a bubo. But this, as I said, is not a separate disease; simply a
fulminant form of plague; and it&#39;s most common among the elderly. </p>
<p>Then there&#39;s
pneumonic plague, which again is the same disease, but clinically and
epidemiologically distinct. It begins with an ordinary case of plague,
complicated by pneumonia, and can then give rise to a secondary catastrophe,
within the general disaster; that is, the disease is then spread by bacteria
coughed out in the sputum of the victim and spread person to person when
inhaled by those near him or her. This form of plague is not dependent on
fleas. It&#39;s highly infectious, and as far as is known is one hundred percent
fatal. And even today, in the antibiotic era, there&#39;s no cure for pneumonic plague.
And pneumonic plague is also recorded in your favorite nursery rhyme. This is
the, &quot;ah-choo, ah-choo, we all fall down.&quot; </p>
<p>Now, what did doctors
do? What were treatments historically? There was a continuity of strategy
from the Black Death, through the eighteenth century, based on Galenic
principles of dealing with the a disequilibrium of the humors. So, the main
indication of treatment was to assist the body in expelling what was called the
peccant humor responsible, or the morbific poison. The physician regarded his
task as one of assisting Nature, as the body was already clearly attempting to
expel the poison. After all, it was vomiting, there was diarrhea and
sweating. So, physicians attempted to assist the body in its fight; perhaps
directly by bleeding, a very popular therapy, although there were intense
debates about timing, about the best veins to be opened, and the amount of
blood to be drawn. </p>
<p>Other key practices
were administering powerful purgatives or emetics, so the poison could pour
forth more copiously; or to cause the patient to sweat, piling him or her high
with clothes, even mattresses, so the poison would pass out through the pores;
and forbidding the sufferer to drink; and of course lancing or cauterizing the
bubo itself, so that it too could discharge its load of poison directly. Some
doctors applied hot compresses. There were also internal medicines that were
administered, as they were thought to raise the buboes, or to hasten recovery
by fortifying what was called the flagging animal energy of the victim; things
like brandy or opium. But in practice, treatment was pitifully rare for plague
sufferers. </p>
<p>Physicians, priests
and attendants recognized that they were powerless; that they were too few in
number to cope with the catastrophe that engulfed them. And they perished too
in great numbers during the outbreaks. And many, overcome with terror like
everyone else, simply fled. So, one of the terrors of the plague was that it
broke the common bonds of humanity, and the common plight of plague victims was
often to be abandoned, to face agony and death alone. Let&#39;s listen to the
famous and awful testimony of Boccaccio in <i>The Decameron</i>, describing
Florence. Sorry for a momentary technological glitch, but we&#39;ll get there. There
we are. </p>
<p>This is Boccaccio
describing Florence in 1348. &quot;Let us omit that one Citizen fled after
another, and one neighbor had not any care of another, Parents nor kindred ever
visiting them, but utterly they were forsaken on all sides: this tribulation
pierced into the hearts of men, and with such a dreadful terror, that one
brother forsook another, the Uncle, the Nephew, the Sister, the Brother, and
the Wife the Husband: nay a matter much greater, and almost incredible; Fathers
and Mothers fled from their own Children, even as if they no way appertained to
them. In regard whereof, it could not be otherwise, but that a countless
multitude of men and women fell sick; finding no charity among their friends,
except a very few, and were subject to the avarice of servants.&quot; </p>
<p>So, this is our first
overview of plague in its three pandemics. Next time what I&#39;d like to do is to
talk about the response of communities to this catastrophe, and to look in
particular at public health measures designed to protect communities. That&#39;s
where we&#39;re heading
next. </p>
