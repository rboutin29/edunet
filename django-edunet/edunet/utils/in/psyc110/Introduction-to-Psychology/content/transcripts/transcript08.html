<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: I'll begin the class officially with a
different sort of demonstration. I want to just show you one of the
change-blindness studies that has been done in the real world. And
these videotapes are not available publicly. We get them from the web
and see them as little Java scripts. So, this is one of the first
studies done by Dan Simons when he was at Cornell. And his adviser at
the time was our Frank Keil, who's now in our department. So, here's
the study. [The videotape shows a student who is walking outside on a
college campus and stops and asks an older man for directions. Their
conversation is interrupted when two construction workers carrying a
door walk in between them. At that point the student surreptitiously
swaps places with one of the men carrying the door. Remarkably, the
conversation about directions resumes without the older man ever
noticing that he is speaking to a completely different person.]
[laughter] And you don't notice it.</p>

<p>Change blindness is one of the more striking phenomena discovered by
laboratory scientists and by psychologists. But it's important to
realize, to get away from the sort of surprise of the gorilla and the
fact that it's hard to see the flickering--the object that's
flickering, and appreciate the big moral of this, because the big moral
of this is actually, I think, striking and quite important. You think
right now that you're perceiving the world. I look down on you and I
think I have a whole sense of where everybody is. I can't see everybody
perfectly in back. You're kind of far away and blurry but there's a
sense in which I have a world around me. Similarly, if I'm to close my
eyes for a second, everything just remains and I could sort of remember
some of the things that are there. That's really good sound
localization by me [responding to a noise he heard from the video
screen].</p>

<p>So you're looking up and you think you have a sense of the world
both in perception and memory. The change-blindness experiment
suggested this isn't true. The change-blindness experiment suggests
that if you look at me for a second and during that second all of your
classmates change positions, including those next to you, you are
extremely unlikely to notice. The change-blindness experiment suggests
that if you turn your eyes away from me towards there for a second and
turn back, and I'm dressed entirely differently, you wouldn't notice.
The exceptions would be if you told yourself consciously, "Remember
what this guy is wearing; he's wearing this, that and the other." But
if you don't do it consciously you'll lose it, and usually this is
okay.</p>

<p>Usually, it's okay because your memory and your visual system
exploits a basic fact about the universe, which is that most things
stay the same most of the time. I don't have to explicitly remember
that you're over there when I turn my head for a second because you'll
be over there in any case. You don't need to hold precise
representations of the world. And so you only notice it in certain
clever circumstances. One sort of clever circumstance is when
psychologists change reality as in the change-blindness studies. A
second sort of circumstance is in movies. So, one of the big surprises
when people started making movies involving cuts was it is extremely
difficult to get everything continuously right. And you need to work
very hard to notice. So, there's all of these continuity errors that
creep up into movies and you have to be a film buff or writing it down
to even notice this. And the overall moral here then is that your
perception of reality is a lot more sparse, a lot more limited, than
you might think it is.</p>

<p>So, this is where we were at the end of last class. We were talking
about the different sorts of memories: Sensory memory, which is the
sort of fraction of a second of sensory residue of what you're hearing
and what you're seeing, working memory, short-term memory, and then
long-term memory. And we talked last class about how things get into
sensory memory, into working memory, the role of attention. And in
fact, the change-blindness studies are actually just studies of how
something gets from your senses to your consciousness and what does and
what doesn't.</p>

<p>Now I want to move to the distinction between working memory,
short-term memory, and long-term memory. Now, the obvious distinction
is actually just in fact--is storage differences. So, long-term memory
or "LTM" has a huge storage capacity. This is your memory like the hard
drive of your computer. This is the memory you walk around with. It
includes all the words in English, just for example, 60 to 80,000
words. It includes everybody you've ever met, languages, faces,
stories, locations, nursery rhymes, songs, TV programs. Nobody knows
the storage. It is not true that you remember everything that has ever
happened to you. There's no reason to believe that this is true. At the
same time though, you have a huge amount stored in your brain in
long-term storage and nobody actually--It has to be limited because
it's a finite, limited brain. But nobody knows how big it is. Nobody
knows how many terabytes you carry around in your brain and--but it's a
lot.</p>

<p>Compare this to working memory â€“ the short-term memory, which is
actually very limited. Your memory of what you could store
on--in--where you could hold in consciousness right now is quite
limited. Here is an exercise. Do not write these things down. I want
you to remember them. I'm just going to give you a few numbers: 14, 59,
11, 109, 43, 58, 98, 487, 25, 389, 54. Please write them down. View
this as an IQ test if that would relax you. How many of you who decided
to participate in this experiment got three or less? Good. Good. Four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine or more? Anybody get all eleven? This is
a particularly difficult memory task. The numbers are meaningless. And
I told--and I forgot to tell you to get your pen and pencil ready, so
some of you just glared at me. But [laughter] under normal
circumstances the cognitive psychologist George Miller said that this
sort of suggested that the standard memory storage of short-term memory
is seven, plus or minus two. And what that means is anywhere from five
to nine roughly.</p>

<p>Some of you, I bet, can beat that. Some of you on a not-so-good day
maybe won't make it that much. Now "seven plus or minus two" is what
you--;so, that's what you hold in consciousness. I can tell you 14, 21.
You walk around, "Oh, yeah, 14, 21." You hold that in consciousness
with no problem. But I throw eleven numbers at you, you can't. Some
dribble out. You can't hold that in your conscious window in your
short-term memory.</p>

<p>Now, this raises the question "seven plus or minus two" what? And
the answer seems to be what George Miller calls "chunks." And a chunk
is a basic memory unit, something you think of as a single, individual
entity. So, suppose you see the string of letters "L, A, M, A, I, S, O,
N." If you don't know--If you can't form these into words and you have
to remember them, these are eight chunks. You have to just pick them up
separately. On the other hand, if you break them up into four words you
could just remember it as four chunks. And if you break it up into two
words in French, "la maison," "the house," it could just be one or two.
How much you know depends--affects how much you memorize--how much you
could store in memory because it affects what counts as a basic unit of
memory.</p>

<p>And there's all sorts of examples of this. If I tell you "1, 1, 0,
1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0," those of you who don't know binary numbers
might have to remember that as "1, 1, 0, 0," whatever I said. Those of
you who are computer scientists or mathematicians or, for whatever
reason, know binary numbers could convert it into a single binary
number. Anybody know what the number is? No, I cannot say it again.
[laughter] Some number, 24, or not 24--to some number, 24, and then you
remember "24." It's easier. Suppose you see a chessboard and the
chessboard is set up and you don't know how to play chess. It is
murderously hard to remember that. They've done the experiments.
They've taken people in a lab who don't know how to play chess. They
set up a chessboard and then they say, "Okay. Look at this for five
minutes." Then they take it away, set it up again, and it's murderously
hard. "There is a horse-y thing on the side there and everything." But
if these chess pieces are set up in some way that's logical for a chess
player, then a chess master could look at it and remember it in a
glance, "Oh. It's the Fibonacci defense" or something like that
[laughs], and then immediately recover it.</p>

<p>Similarly, football coaches have been tested on their memories of
football diagrams. And they have a photographic memory for football
diagrams because it corresponds to things that make sense. Architects
could have a photographic memory, a perfect memory for floor plans
because it makes sense to them. They understand it. And so the way you
store things in memory, and this is a theme we're going to return to
when we get to long-term memory, depends in a large extent on how much
you understand it. And this shows up in expertise effects.</p>

<p>Now, this is what's happening so far in short-term memory, how much
you hold in there. The question is how do you get it into long-term
memory? So, you have long-term memory, your major storage system. How
does information get from your consciousness to long-term storage?
Well, there's one thing--there's one way which sort of works sometimes
but not very well. And it's called "maintenance rehearsal."</p>

<p>Suppose I said you have to remember this number, this string of
numbers. And if you remember it in twenty minutes you will get one
thousand dollars. And the string is my phone number when I was a kid.
I'll include the area code: 514-688-9057. Now, if you tell that to a
four-year-old, well, the four-year-old will say, "I'll remember it."
And then you ask them, "What did I just say?" "Well, I don't know." If
you tell it to an--because you know something--If a lot depended on it,
you would know to do something. What you would do is you'd say to
yourself, "514-688-9057, 514-688-9057, 514-688 --" You'd rehearse it in
your head over and over again. The problem is you could hold it as long
as you can do that. It's like these movies. You see this all the time,
like an episode of <i>24</i>: "Jack, call CTU and tell them Agent 11 is
trapped in a--" And I can't even remember this but the way to remember
it is you hold--you've just got to repeat it over and over again in
your head. But this will not typically get things into long-term
memory.</p>

<p>To get things into long-term memory, rehearsal is usually not
enough. You need to do other things. Typically, what you need is
structure and organization. And one way to demonstrate this was in a
classic "depth of processing" experiment which nicely illustrates the
fact that the more you structure something, the deeper you think about
it, the better it gets entrenched in the long-term memory.</p>

<p>So, in this study what they did was they asked people--they told
people that there's going to be words flashed on a screen. And all of
the subjects saw the same strings of words. There were forty-eight
words. They were not told to memorize the words. One third of the
subjects was told, "Look. Some of these words are going to come out in
capital letters, some of them not capital letters. Press a button for
capitals, non-capitals." "Sure." The other group was told, "Some of
these words will rhyme with 'train,' Others won't. Press a button if it
rhymes in 'train'." The third group was told, "Does it fit into the
sentence â€˜The girl placed the blank on the table'? Press a button if it
does. Press a button if it doesn't." Then they were asked as a
surprise, "What words did you see?" And the findings looked like this.
When they were asked to focus on just what the word looked like, memory
was very poor, the sound better, the meaning better. If you want to
remember something, the best way to remember it is to give it meaning,
to give it sense.</p>

<p>This is illustrated through a very ancient technique, which is that
the way to remember things that are otherwise arbitrary is to give them
some organization through memory tricks, through vivid imagery or songs
or poetry. And there's a lot of examples of this. Do you know how to
remember that the hippocampus--There's a part of the brain called the
hippocampus. This is the worst memory trick ever but it will stick with
you for twenty years. The hippocampus is involved in spatial memory.
It's involved in finding your way around. Think to yourself, "The way I
find my way around campus is through the hippocampus." And you think,
"Well, that's stupid," but you'll never forget now that the hippocampus
is in charge of spatial memory. It's going to be all you retain from
this course.</p>

<p>Memory books on how to remember people's names usually try to
exploit this sort of thing when you try to get poetry or dramatic
images. So, the memory books always typically involve somebody--like
you meet somebody with very spiky hair and they say, "My name is Mr.
Fish" and then you remember--you think of their--of a big fish impaled
on their hair. And then whenever you see them you remember their name.
It only really works for names like "Fish" but [laughter] the idea is
you try to generate vivid imagery. When stuck with a situation where
you have to remember ten letters, turn it into a song where--or a dirty
poem where each of the letters is the first words of it. When having to
remember something that seems totally arbitrary, try to figure out a
grand and obscene image that will come to mind easily. And this is
how--these are one way to get things into memory.</p>

<p>At a deep level though, the way to get things into memory, and this
applies to this course no less than anything else, is by understanding
the--understanding it. I'm going to read you something and I want you
to try your best to remember what I tell you. These are not going to be
strings of numbers. These are going to be--This is going to be a series
of sentences: "A newspaper is better than a magazine. A seashore is a
better place than the street. At first it is better to run than to
walk. You may have to try several times. It takes some skill but it's
easy to learn. Even young children can enjoy it. Once successful,
complications are minimal. Birds seldom get too close. Rain, however,
soaks in very fast. Too many people doing the same things can also
cause problems. One needs lots of room. If there are no complications,
it can be very peaceful. Finally, a rock will serve as an anchor. If
things break loose from it, however, you will not have a second
chance."</p>

<p>And here is what I said [pointing to the written sentences on the
overhead slide]. This is murderously hard to remember. Now try it.
[Pointing to a slide that reads, "This paragraph is about flying a
kite."] Knowing what this is about, being able to put a context to it
helps the memory and helps it come to mind. [laughter]</p>

<p>Okay. So, this is about how to get memory--how to get information
into your memory. How do you get information out? So, it's exam period.
You got the stuff presumably into your head. You have to get it out.
You have to retrieve it. There is a court case. You have to figure
out--You have to recount the crime that you witnessed. You see somebody
and you want to know his or her name. And you heard it; you just have
to get it out. Well, how do you do that? Well, there's "retrieval
cues." Retrieval cues make sense. Retrieval cues are just things that
have been associated with what you--what you're trying to remember. If
I have to remember to replace the windows, when I walk in to my living
room and see that a window is cracked that will remind me to replace
the windows. If I had a lunch date with you and forgot about it, when I
see you, "Oh, yeah. We were supposed to get together to have
lunch."</p>

<p>Retrieval cues bring things back but it's a little bit more
complicated than that. There's a more general relationship between
encoding and retrieval called the "compatibility principle." And what
this means is you're much better to remember something in the context
in which you have learned it. And this is also known as
"context-dependent memory" and "state-dependent memory." It's
illustrated by one of the strangest experiments in the history of
psychology where they had people on a boat and then they had them scuba
dive underwater. And they taught them things either on the boat or
underwater with things that they held up. And then they tested them
later. And it turns out that you'll remember it better if you're tested
on it in the context in which you learned it. And it might be because
then the retrieval cues help bring it back. But it's more general than
that. If you have to remember something you learned in this class, you
will do better if you try to think about the room in which you learned
it in. You will do better on your final exam if you were to take it in
this room than if you were to take it in another room because being in
this room will bring back the cues.</p>

<p>It's not just the environment. People who learn things when they're
stoned remember them better--keeping stoned at a sort of a low-level
that doesn't disrupt other mental activities--remember them better when
they're sort of stoned again [laughter] than if they're non-stoned.
Similarly--So, if you study while you drink you should tipple a little
bit before coming in to the Final exam. [laughter] It's sort of like
the "what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas" sort of result. And so,
similarly, it even applies to moods in that if you learn something when
depressed you have a slightly better recovery of it when you're in that
same mood of depression than when you're elated. And the idea is that
part of what memory is--part of what recovering memory is is getting
back your original context in which you learned it.</p>

<p>"Elaborative rehearsal" and retrieval involves the connections
between different things. Elaborative rehearsal is that the more you
think about something the easier it is to remember. If you have to
think about--If you have to remember something, try to connect it to as
many things as possible. Think of an image. Make a joke out of it.
Imagine how you would explain it to somebody else. Imagine how the
world--what the world would be like if it wasn't so. And the idea is
that this sort of thinking about it makes connections in your memory
from that thing you have to learn, to other memories. And so it makes
it easier to recover.</p>

<p>"Elaborative retrieval" refers to a finding that when you want to
get something back out of memory people tend to give up too soon. It
turns out that there's a lot of stuff that's in your memory but it
needs work to extract; it needs various sort of searching strategies.
One study asked people who were considerably older than you to remember
their high school classmates. And in the first pass people were
terrible. Maybe they had a couple of friends they kept in touch with.
Otherwise, pretty bad. And this is a good experiment because you could
use high school yearbooks to judge whether or not they get it right.
But then what you do is you tell the person, "Look. Keep trying. Were
you--What sort of--Who was your teacher? What sort of clubs did you
belong to? What sort of sports you--did you participate in? How did you
get to school? How did you get from school? What did you do during
lunch? What did you do during break?" And you keep ask--"Do you
know--have any friends whose letter--whose last name began with â€˜B,'
with â€˜C,' with â€˜D'?" And you keep pushing and pushing and pushing. And
over the span of time things come back. Again, it's not true that you
never forget. There is honest to God forgetting but sometimes you think
you forget and it's because you haven't looked long enough. There's a
real physical notion of searching for the right answer.</p>

<p>We've talked about retrieval. Oh. Every class I've given somebody
asks either in class or by e-mail what about dÃ©jÃ  vu? And dÃ©jÃ  vu is a
feeling that an event has happened before. So, you're looking at me and
I'm lecturing and you say, "I've heard this before. I know this
before." You see somebody and say, "I've been in this situation
before." This is not evidence for psychic powers, [laughter] which many
people say it is, but nobody really knows why this exists. We know, and
this is a clue, it's worse with frontal lobe damage. If you get damage
to this part of the brain, you get a lot more dÃ©jÃ  vu experiences. I
asked some experts in memory, including Marcia Johnson who is chair of
our department, what the best explanation for dÃ©jÃ  vu is. And the
answer she gave, the--say one big theory, goes like this. DÃ©jÃ  vu is a
feeling that it's happened before. The answer is it has happened
before. It's happened half a second ago. And so what happens is
sometimes there is a glitch, a disturbance in the force. I don't know.
There's a glitch [laughter] and you are talking and then something
happens to you and you put it in your memory. But it's as if you don't
put the stamp on it of what time and what date. So, you're talking to
me and then you store it in memory but you don't store it in memory as
happening right now. Then half a second goes by and you're talking to
me and you say, "This is strangely familiar." And that's one theory of
what goes on in dÃ©jÃ  vu.</p>

<p>Okay. So far, there's the sort of good news â€“ remembering â€“ but then
there's bad news â€“ forgetting. How many people can remember, without
looking down at your notes, at least two of the numbers I gave you
earlier? How many people can remember at least four? Oh, impressive. If
I asked you in an hour, the number would go down. These are sort of
statistics in a similar experiment [pointing to an overhead slide]. And
this graph illustrates that people forget. Over time, you'll
forget.</p>

<p>Why do you forget? Why is there forgetting at all? Well, there's
different explanations for this. One explanation is your brain's a
physical thing, it's a physical piece of meat, and it kind of goes bad.
Physical things decay. And so, the memory traces that are laid onto
your brain will just decay over time. A second answer is interference.
So, remember those numbers? Here's a few more: 114, 81, 66, 42. Well,
the more information that comes in that's similar to the stuff you're
trying to remember, it blocks your recovery of original information. So
your ability to remember something can be impaired by learning more
things which are related to it because they get confused in memory.
Finally, and maybe this is most interesting, there are changes in
retrieval cues. So, the more time goes by the more the world changes.
And if your memory is to some extent dependent on cues bringing it back
to life, then the change in retrieval cues can make it more difficult
to recall certain things.</p>

<p>This leads to a puzzle where there's considerable scientific debate
over the case of childhood amnesia. And the case of childhood amnesia
is--doesn't refer to when a child gets brain damage and gets amnesia.
What it refers to is people have a difficult time recovering very early
memories. I want people to just take a second and try to think back on
what your first memory is and roughly how old you were. How many people
don't think you have a first memory until you were about five years old
or older? Okay. How many people think you have the first memory of
around age four or younger? How many people think you have the first
memory of around age three or younger? Two or younger? How many of you
think you have the first memory when you were about one years old or
younger? And I'm not asking about past lives but that [laughs] happened
last year. How old is your--roughly your first memory do you think?
[pointing towards a student] How old?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Between one and two.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Between one and two? Anybody think they
could beat that? Same guy? Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> One.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> One. [laughter] Anybody else? The
literature is unclear on this because it's very difficult to test
people's recollections of their first memories. If I'm to ask people
about their first memories, they'll often say, "Oh, yeah. I remember I
was in this room and there was a crib and I'm going â€˜Ga ga, goo goo'
[laughter] and I was on the potty. I was walking. I was so cute. I
remember it." It's very difficult to tell and, as we'll discuss in some
detail, there are a lot of reasons to distrust people when they--not
that they're lying but to distrust the accuracy of people's
memories.</p>

<p>We also know from studies about trauma where people have terrible
experiences when they're one or two. Typically, this trauma is not
remembered later on. People know of trauma because they're told about
it but they don't typically remember it with any accuracy. Even
children--older children don't remember back beyond that age. Nobody
knows why childhood amnesia occurs. Nobody knows why it's very
difficult to recover memories before about the age of three. One theory
is that the retrieval cues change radically. I had a friend of mine
who's a clinical psychologist and he suggested a new form of therapy
where they make these giant tables and chairs and then they bring you
in to the office and you're standing there with these giant tables and
chairs [laughter] and all these memories of being a baby would come
flooding back. [laughter] And he dropped out of the field and--
[laughter] Really, but it's such a cool idea.</p>

<p>Some people think language is to blame. So a child, a baby, starts
out with no spoken or signed language. Language comes to be learned at
around one, two, and three, and it might be that the learning of a
language reformats your memory. And once the memory is reformatted it
can't go back to the previous state prior to language in the end. It
could be neural maturation. It could be that those memory parts of the
brains grow around age two or three that just weren't there prior to
that. And nobody really knows. It's a fascinating research area
why--about memory changes early on.</p>

<p>Another case of memory failure is brain damage. And brain damage
comes in a couple of flavors. There is retrograde amnesia; "retro" for
past. Retrograde amnesia is when you lose some memory of the past. This
could be in a case where you get some sort of head trauma and you lose
memory of your entire episodic memory. But typically, if you have any
sort of serious accident that involves you losing consciousness you'll
have a blackout of some period prior to that, say, blow to the head.
And the reason for this is as you're having these experiences now they
need to kind of get consolidated into your brain. Your brain needs to
rewire and catch up to the experiences you're having. A sudden blow to
the head will knock you unconscious and then the memories that have
happened immediately prior will not get consolidated and they'll be
lost forever.</p>

<p>Another sort of memory is anterograde amnesia and this was the case
of--This happens in Korsakoff's syndrome. It happens to a very famous
patient known as H.M. who actually lives in Hartford, Connecticut. And
it happened to Clive Wearing, the film you saw last class. And this
sort of amnesia is a sort of amnesia where you lose the ability to form
new memories. And so you live in a perpetual present, unable to
accumulate new memories.</p>

<p>But it's actually a little bit more complicated than that. What
happens is--And this was an exciting discovery about these patients
that led to some real insights about normal memory--What happens
is--And this is the brain damage in these cases, the temporal lobe and
the hippocampus, very useful for spatial memory you'll know. One
discovery made about people who couldn't form new memories is that they
could form new memories, but of certain types. So for example, this is
a task here involving filling in a star while looking in to a mirror.
And if I asked you to do it you'd find it pretty difficult. It's just
kind of difficult to do. You'd be clumsy at it. You bring in an amnesic
who can't form new memories and you say, "Hey. I want you to try
something new. I want you to try this star game." He'd say, "Okay. I've
never seen it before but I'll do it." Tries it. Does very badly. You
bring him in and over and over again--Each time he does it he starts
off by saying, "I've never seen this before. I'll--I'm sure I'll give
it a try" but he gets better and better at it. And this is known as
implicit memory.</p>

<p>The claim is that in these sorts of cases you lose the abilities to
form explicit conscious memories that you're aware of, that you
understand. But some sorts of memories persist and you are able to form
them. This has actually been illustrated in a couple of dramatic
movies, one of them a very bad dramatic movie [laughs] where Drew
Barrymore loses the ability to form new memories and somehow falls in
love with Adam Sandler. [laughs] Definitely don't watch that. But a
very good movie called "Memento," which is about a character who loses
his ability to form new memories while trying to track down his wife's
killer. "Memento" is a movie which is fascinating because it's told
backwards. But throughout "Memento" there's another story told
forwards. And I like this story because it very dramatically
illustrates what does, and what is and is not impaired in cases of
severe memory damage. So, I'm going to show you a couple of clips that
illustrate the disassociation from "Memento." [clip playing]</p>

<p>Now, the next scene is actually modeled after real experiments.
[clip playing] Those of you who have seen the movie know that this ends
up quite tragically for Sammy. I highly recommend the movie. We've
dealt right now with two sorts of failures of memory. One is everyday
failure of memory when you forget. How many of you remember three or
more of the numbers I originally presented? Yeah? Go ahead.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Fourteen, 59, 11. Is that right?
[laughs] Fine. [laughter] All right. I'm going to ask you again in a
month. [laughter] Well, people are supposed to forget [laughter] and
some things will--you will forget. That's normal forgetting.</p>

<p>A second case is forgetting due to brain damage. Forgetting due to
brain damage is exotic and unusual but it's interesting in that it
illustrates some more general themes about how the mind works. Remember
one theme of this course is we're going to look at exotic cases like
the case of Clive Wearing, not just because they're interesting in
their own right but sometimes by looking at the extremes we could learn
something about how normal people's normal, intact minds and brains
work.</p>

<p>The third case of forgetting is more interesting and it
actually--Well, I want to do a little trial here. What I want to do is
I want to--You to listen to three children describe an event that
happened. I want you to come to some--your own guess. Imagine you were
a judge, you were a childcare worker, you wanted to see--I want you to
be--come to your own guess about who you believe and what you think
happened. [audio playing] [inaudible] [laughter]</p>

<p>You've heard three children. Who do you believe? Who
believes--There's three of them, one, two, three. Who believes the
first one? Who believes the second one? Who believes the third one?
Sort of an even split. Twenty-three hundred experts were shown these
films and asked about the different actions, whether or not the person
ripped the book, messed up the bear, tossed the book in the air and, as
you could see, the majority thought that he did. This is work done by
Steve Ceci who was gracious enough to lend me the film to use for
teaching purposes.</p>

<p>It turns out the second girl was right. Absolutely nothing happened.
[laughter] The teacher said, "There is somebody named Sam Stone who's
going to come in." A guy walks in and says, "Hi," walks around and
leaves. [laughter] The first and third children had their memories
implanted, not through any sort of science fiction means. They had
their memories implanted--Well, they had their memories implanted like
this. Some of the children would just ask questions. The interviewer,
by the way, was herself unaware of what happened so the interviewer was
a perfectly naÃ¯ve interviewer. And it turns out if you just interview
children and you ask them questions about whether the book was ripped,
"Did you see him? Did he really do it?" they don't say anything. They
didn't see anything and they won't say anything.</p>

<p>Other children were told about Sam Stone. They were told a
stereotype about Sam Stone â€“ that he's very clumsy and he tends to rip
things and he trips and he breaks things and he spills things. And in
fact, the third child mentioned that in passing. He said, "He always
does that." Just knowing this about Sam Stone tends to raise the
proportion of kids who say, for instance, that he ripped the book.</p>

<p>Other children were given suggestions. They were given suggestive
questioning. They were a series of leading questions like, "Oh. Sam
Stone came in? Did he rip a book while he was there?" And still more
children got both. And in fact, the children you saw were from this
group. They heard Sam Stone being described as a clumsy fellow and they
were given a series of suggestive questionings. In this condition they
were given several suggestive questionings over the period of several
months. These children, like the first child and the third child, are
not lying. They honestly believe that Sam Stone came in and did these
things. Also they believe it and they're so convincing in their belief
that experts, including police officers and child caseworkers and
judges and lawyers, find these children to be extremely believable. And
I think they probably find them to be extremely believable because the
children are not lying. They really believe they saw what they saw. But
these memories were implanted. And Ceci, and many other investigators,
study how memories can be implanted in people's minds through
suggestion and through leading questions.</p>

<p>It turns out that the same sort of experiments and the same sort of
research has been done with considerable success in implanting false
memories in adults. There are dramatic cases of people remembering
terrible crimes and confessing to them when actually, they didn't
commit them. And this is not because they are lying. It's not even
because they're, in some obvious sense, deranged or schizophrenic or
delusional. Rather, they have persuaded themselves, or more often been
persuaded by others, that these things have actually happened.</p>

<p>Psychologists have studied in the laboratory how one could do this,
how one can implant memories in other people. And some things are sort
of standard. Suppose I was to tell you a story about a trip I took to
the dentist or a visit I took to--or a time when I ate out at a
restaurant and I'm to omit certain details. I omit the fact that I paid
the bill in a restaurant, let's say or I finished the meal and then I
went home. Still, you will tend to fill in the blanks. You'll tend to
fill in the blanks with things you know. So, you might remember this
later saying, "Okay. He told me he finished eating, paid the bill and
left," because paying the bill is what you do in a restaurant.</p>

<p>This is benign enough. You fill in the blanks. You also can
integrate suppositions made by others. And the clearest case of this is
eyewitness testimony. And the best research on this has been done by
Elizabeth Loftus who has done a series of studies, some discussed in
the textbook, showing how people's memories can be swayed by leading
questions. And it can be extremely subtle. In one experiment, the
person was just asked in the course of a series of questions--shown a
scene where there's a car accident and asked either, "Did you see a
broken headlight?" or "Did you see the broken headlight?" The â€˜the'
presupposes that there was a broken headlight and in fact, the people
told--asked, "Did you see the broken headlight?" later on are more
likely to remember one. It creates an image and they fill it in.</p>

<p>In another study, she would show film segments and then ask, "Did
you see the children getting on the school bus?" Now, there was no
school bus but people who hear that question later on when asked, "Did
you see a school bus in the film?" are more likely to say yes. In
another study, she would show people film segments and ask them either,
"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?" or "How fast
were the cars going when they smashed into each other?" A week later
she'd bring people back in to the laboratory and ask, "Did you see any
broken glass?" Those who hear a smash tend to see the broken glass more
than those who hear a hit because the question has changed their
memory, making it more of a dramatic event.</p>

<p>Hypnosis is the clearest case where there's a sort of reconstructive
effort led by--led as a result of leading and probing questions. Some
of you are readily hypnotizable and you can be hypnotized. And what we
would learn about a past event from hypnotizing you will not
necessarily then be inaccurate. What hypnotizing does is it makes
people very willing to cooperate. Unfortunately, it isn't as if there
is a memory storage there where you could just go through and look as
in the movies where you just say, "What's the license plate?" The
person's hypnotized and then the flashback comes in and then they zoom
in on the license plate. Memory doesn't work that way. What happens
is--What somebody will do in a hypnotizable state is they'll be very
eager to please the hypnotist. And so they'll make stuff up.</p>

<p>And people under hypnosis just make stuff up. And they do very
enthusiastically and very believably make stuff up. This is
particularly the case with hypnotic regression when we ask you to go
back to your sixth birthday party, for instance. And what's great as a
developmental psychologist is if I ask you to go back to your fourth
birthday party and you're hypnotizable you'll be oh, just like a
four-year-old except you won't be like a real four-year-old. What
you'll be like is an adult's notion of what a four-year-old is supposed
to be. In fact, this has happened in the extreme case with hypnotic
regression where people claim to speak languages like from ancient
Egypt. And linguists love these studies because you don't--of course
you don't really sound like you're speaking a language from ancient
Egypt. What you sound is like a North American who believes he's
speaking a language from ancient Egypt so they're, "nonsense sounds."
[laughter] And so what it makes you is--Hypnotism brings out the actor
in you. It makes you want to give a persuasive account of what
happened. And so hypnotism is just an extreme form of what normally
happens in eyewitness testimony.</p>

<p>Repressed memories. We could devote a class--We could devote a
semester to the very heated debate in the United States mostly about
repressed memories. There are many adults who have claimed to have
experienced traumatic sexual abuse. In some cases, this is
unexceptional from a memory point of view. People know this happened to
them. They've always known it happens to them and then they tell people
about it. But there's a subset of cases where people have had no memory
up to a point of what happened to them. Then they go to a psychologist
or a psychiatrist; they undergo questioning, often using hypnotic
techniques; and then they recover a memory of past traumatic sexual
abuse. And what this is--what makes this so debatable, and there is a
debate about this. I don't want to try to preclude it one way or
another. What makes this debatable is some psychologists believe that,
in at least some cases, these memories are real and they have been
repressed through a Freudian mechanism â€“ that they're too terrible to
bring to consciousness, and the therapy brings them out into real life.
But most psychologists believe that these memories cannot be trusted,
that these memories are created through the actions of the
therapist.</p>

<p>And so, there's actually considerable psychological and legal
battles over the veracity of the therapists where women who have
claimed to have sexual--be sexually abused, for instance, have pressed
criminal charges against their fathers on the basis of false memories.
Similarly, people who have been accused of sexual abuse have pressed
criminal charges against psychiatrists claiming that these
psychiatrists have implanted the memories into their sons and
daughters. It is controversial whether memories are ever repressed.
What isn't controversial is that, for at least some cases, you can
implant false memories in people, not because you're a sinister or evil
person but because you really believed something happened. And you
talked to them about it and then you caused these memories to come into
being.</p>

<p>A final case is flashbulb memories. I asked this early in the
semester. I'll ask it again. How many of you remember where you were on
September 11, 2001? Is there anybody who doesn't remember where they
were on September 11, 2001? It would be interesting. It was a socially
relevant event, but here's the problem with these flashbulb memories.
Flashbulb memories are the idea that these memories being so vivid, and
they are vivid for many of us--exactly where we stood, what happened;
well, they can't really be trusted. And here is why not. Because they
are such important events, I bet many of you have actually heard the
question before, "Where were you on September 11<sup>th</sup>?" and
talked about it. What happens in these conversations is stories change.
I have my--I knew where I was on September 11<sup>th</sup>. My wife
knew where she was. But I spent as much time listening to her talk
about it as I spent time me talking about it. And now maybe my memory
is actually of her experience and not mine.</p>

<p>It's not--For all of these cases, the temptation you have to resist
is saying, "Yes. I know memories can be swayed. I know they could be
distorted and everything but, you see, I really am sure that happened."
You have to resist that temptation because there are so many cases we
know, including the tape of the girls that we just saw, where people
are entirely sure things happened. And we know full well that they
didn't exist. Being sure is no guarantee that a memory isn't false,
reconstructed or even implanted.</p>

<p>So, this part of memory has three main morals. There are many types
of memories. I talked about short-term memory, long-term memory. I
talked about implicit memory and explicit memory. These are sort of
separable sort of memories. You could break one while having the other
one impaired. Arguably, there are brain systems dedicated to memory for
faces, memory for everyday objects, memory for spatial locations. The
key to remembering is organization and understanding. Introduction to
"X" courses, including Introduction to Psychology courses, are among
the hardest courses at Yale. And the reason why is there is just a lot
of material that is diverse and you have to command each aspect
separately. The easiest courses at Yale tend to be highfalutin seminars
where you kind of have enough of a background that everything is--can
be clear and understandable. The more you understand something, the
easier you'll remember it.</p>

<p>And finally, you can't trust some of your memories. Your reading
response for this week is you have to use your powers for good and not
for evil, [laughter] though if you manage to succeed at this I will be
very impressed. [laughter] But you have to describe, based on the
lecture materials and the readings, how to implant a false memory. We
have a few minutes. Any questions on memory. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Uh huh. Hey. Please--</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible] Is that long-term sensory memory?</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> The example is, "What sort of memory is
it when you know how to play the piano?" And it's a very good question.
It is long-term memory because you might know how to do a concerto or a
song and then you have it stored in your head and you carry it around
with you. You'll remember it a year from now, two years from now. It is
long-term memory but it is also an excellent example of implicit memory
because you know how to do it but you could do it unconsciously without
attending to it. It's not sensory but it's as if, put it crudely, that
your fingers know and not your mind. We have time for one more
question. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> The question is about photographic
memory. There are a lot of claims about photographic memory. My
understanding is they do not tend to be substantiated. Sometimes
photographic memory, and this came up when we talked about autism a few
classes ago, is linked with savant-like skills. People who have severe
impairments in some ways may have photographic memories in others. I am
not convinced that photographic memory in the sense that you see
something, you take a picture of it, you hold it in memory really
exists. I think there may be one or two case studies that suggest it
might be real but I think it's controversial. Okay. We have a guest
lecturer on Wednesday. Dean Peter Salovey will talk to us about
love.</p>
