<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: We're going to begin the class proper,
Introduction to Psychology, with a discussion about the brain. And, in
particular, I want to lead off the class with an idea that the Nobel
Prize winning biologist, Francis Crick, described as "The Astonishing
Hypothesis." And The Astonishing Hypothesis is summarized like this. As
he writes, The Astonishing Hypothesis is that:</p>

<blockquote>You, your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your
ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no
more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their
associated molecules. As Lewis Carroll's Alice might have phrased it,
"you're nothing but a pack of neurons."</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It is fair to describe this as astonishing. It is an odd and
unnatural view and I don't actually expect people to believe it at
first. It's an open question whether you'll believe it when this class
comes to an end, but I'd be surprised if many of you believe it now.
Most people don't. Most people, in fact, hold a different view. Most
people are dualists. Now, dualism is a very different doctrine. It's a
doctrine that can be found in every religion and in most philosophical
systems throughout history. It was very explicit in Plato, for
instance.</p>

<p>But the most articulate and well-known defender of dualism is the
philosopher Rene Descartes, and Rene Descartes explicitly asked a
question, "Are humans merely physical machines, merely physical
things?" And he answered, "no." He agreed that animals are machines. In
fact, he called them "beast machines" and said animals, nonhuman
animals are merely robots, but people are different. There's a duality
of people. Like animals, we possess physical material bodies, but
unlike animals, what we are is not physical. We are immaterial souls
that possess physical bodies, that have physical bodies, that reside in
physical bodies, that connect to physical bodies. So, this is known as
dualism because the claim is, for humans at least, there are two
separate things; there's our material bodies and there's our immaterial
minds.</p>

<p>Now, Descartes made two arguments for dualism. One argument involved
observations of a human action. So, Descartes lived in a fairly
sophisticated time, and his time did have robots. These were not
electrical robots, of course. They were robots powered by hydraulics.
So, Descartes would walk around the French Royal Gardens and the French
Royal Gardens were set up like a seventeenth-century Disneyland. They
had these characters that would operate according to water flow and so
if you stepped on a certain panel, a swordsman would jump out with a
sword. If you stepped somewhere else, a bathing beauty would cover
herself up behind some bushes. And Descartes said, "Boy, these machines
respond in certain ways to certain actions so machines can do certain
things and, in fact," he says, "our bodies work that way too. If you
tap somebody on the knee, your leg will jump out. Well, maybe that's
what we are." But Descartes said that can't be because there are things
that humans do that no machine could ever do. Humans are not limited to
reflexive action. Rather, humans are capable of coordinated, creative,
spontaneous things. We can use language, for instance, and sometimes my
use of language can be reflexive. Somebody says, "How are you?" And I
say, "I am fine. How are you?" But sometimes I could say what I choose
to be, "How are you?" "Pretty damn good." I can just choose. And
machines, Descartes argued, are incapable of that sort of choice.
Hence, we are not mere machines.</p>

<p>The second argument is, of course, quite famous and this was the
method. This he came to using the method of doubt. So, he started
asking himself the question, "What can I be sure of?" And he said,
"Well, I believe there's a God, but honestly, I can't be sure there's a
God. I believe I live in a rich country but maybe I've been fooled." He
even said, "I believe I have had friends and family but maybe I am
being tricked. Maybe an evil demon, for instance, has tricked me, has
deluded me into thinking I have experiences that aren't real." And, of
course, the modern version of this is The Matrix.</p>

<p>The idea of The Matrix is explicitly built upon
Cartesian--Descartes' worries about an evil demon. Maybe everything
you're now experiencing is not real, but rather is the product of some
other, perhaps malevolent, creature. Descartes, similarly, could doubt
he has a body. In fact, he noticed that madmen sometimes believe they
have extra limbs or they believe they're of different sizes and shapes
than they really are and Descartes said, "How do I know I'm not crazy?
Crazy people don't think they're crazy so the fact that I don't think
I'm crazy doesn't mean I'm not crazy. How do I know," Descartes said,
"I'm not dreaming right now?" But there is one thing, Descartes
concluded, that he cannot doubt, and the answer is he cannot doubt that
he is himself thinking. That would be self-refuting. And so, Descartes
used the method of doubt to say there's something really different
about having a body that's always uncertain from having a mind. And he
used this argument as a way to support dualism, as a way to support the
idea that bodies and minds are separate. And so he concluded, "I knew
that I was a substance, the whole essence or nature of which is to
think, and that for its existence, there is no need of any place nor
does it depend on any material thing. That is to say, the soul by which
I am, when I am, is entirely distinct from body."</p>

<p>Now, I said before that this is common sense and I want to
illustrate the common sense nature of this in a few ways. One thing is
our dualism is enmeshed in our language. So, we have a certain mode of
talking about things that we own or things that are close to us – my
arm, my heart, my child, my car – but we also extend that to my body
and my brain. We talk about owning our brains as if we're somehow
separate from them. Our dualism shows up in intuitions about personal
identity. And what this means is that common sense tells us that
somebody can be the same person even if their body undergoes radical
and profound changes. The best examples of this are fictional. So, we
have no problem understanding a movie where somebody goes to sleep as a
teenager and wakes up as Jennifer Garner, as an older person. Now,
nobody says, "Oh, that's a documentary. I believe that thoroughly true"
but at the same time nobody, no adult, no teenager, no child ever
leaves and says, "I'm totally conceptually confused." Rather, we follow
the story. We can also follow stories which involve more profound
transformations as when a man dies and is reborn into the body of a
child.</p>

<p>Now, you might have different views around--People around this room
will have different views as to whether reincarnation really exists,
but we can imagine it. We could imagine a person dying and then
reemerging in another body. This is not Hollywood invention. One of the
great short stories of the last century begins with a sentence by Franz
Kafka: "As Gregor Samsa woke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found
himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect." And again,
Kafka invites us to imagine waking up into a body of a cockroach and we
can. This is also not modern. Hundreds of years before the birth of
Christ, Homer described the fate of the companions of Odysseus who were
transformed by a witch into pigs. Actually, that's not quite right. She
didn't turn them into pigs. She did something worse. She stuck them in
the bodies of pigs. They had the head and voice and bristles and body
of swine but their minds remained unchanged as before, so they were
penned there weeping. And we are invited to imagine the fate of again
finding ourselves in the bodies of other creatures and, if you can
imagine this, this is because you are imagining what you are as
separate from the body that you reside in.</p>

<p>We allow for the notion that many people can occupy one body. This
is a mainstay of some slapstick humor including the classic movie,
<i>All of Me</i>--Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin – highly recommended.
But many people think this sort of thing really happens. One analysis
of multiple personality disorder is that you have many people inside a
single body fighting it out for control. Now, we will discuss multiple
personality disorder towards the end of the semester and it turns out
things are a good deal more complicated than this, but still my point
isn't about how it really is but how we think about it. Common sense
tells us you could have more than one person inside a single body. This
shows up in a different context involving exorcisms where many belief
systems allow for the idea that people's behavior, particularly their
evil or irrational behavior, could be because something else has taken
over their bodies.</p>

<p>Finally, most people around the world, all religions and most people
in most countries at most times, believe that people can survive the
destruction of their bodies. Now, cultures differ according to the fate
of the body. Some cultures have the body going to--sorry--the fate of
the soul. Some cultures have you going to Heaven or descending to Hell.
Others have you occupying another body. Still, others have you
occupying an amorphous spirit world. But what they share is the idea
that what you are is separable from this physical thing you carry
around. And the physical thing that you carry around can be destroyed
while you live on.</p>

<p>These views are particularly common in the United States. In one
survey done in Chicago a few years ago, people were asked their
religion and then were asked what would happen to them when they died.
Most people in the sample were Christian and about 96% of Christians
said, "When I die I'm going to go to Heaven." Some of the sample was
Jewish. Now, Judaism is actually a religion with a less than clear
story about the afterlife. Still, most of the subjects who identified
themselves as Jewish said when they die they will go to Heaven. Some of
the sampled denied having any religion at all--said they have no
religion at all. Still, when these people were asked what would happen
when they would die, most of them answered, "I'm going to go to
Heaven."</p>

<p>So, dualism is emmeshed. A lot rests on it but, as Crick points out;
the scientific consensus now is that dualism is wrong. There is no
"you" separable or separate from your body. In particular, there is no
"you" separable from your brain. To put it the way cognitive scientists
and psychologists and neuroscientists like to put it, "the mind is what
the brain does." The mind reflects the workings of the brain just like
computation reflects the working of a computer. Now, why would you hold
such an outrageous view? Why would you reject dualism in favor of this
alternative? Well, a few reasons. One reason is dualism has always had
its problems. For one thing, it's a profoundly unscientific doctrine.
We want to know as curious people how children learn language, what we
find attractive or unattractive, and what's the basis for mental
illness. And dualism simply says, "it's all nonphysical, it's part of
the ether," and hence fails to explain it.</p>

<p>More specifically, dualists like Descartes struggle to explain how a
physical body connects to an immaterial soul. What's the conduit? How
could this connection be made? After all, Descartes knew full well that
there is such a connection. Your body obeys your commands. If you bang
your toe or stub your toe you feel pain. If you drink alcohol it
affects your reasoning, but he could only wave his hands as to how this
physical thing in the world could connect to an immaterial mind.</p>

<p>Descartes, when he was alive, was reasonable enough concluding that
physical objects cannot do certain things. He was reasonable enough in
concluding, for instance, as he did, that there's no way a merely
physical object could ever play a game of chess because--and that such
a capacity is beyond the capacity of the physical world and hence you
have to apply--you have to extend the explanation to an immaterial soul
but now we know--we have what scientists call an existence proof. We
know physical objects can do complicated and interesting things. We
know, for instance, machines can play chess. We know machines can
manipulate symbols. We know machines have limited capacities to engage
in mathematical and logical reasoning, to recognize things, to do
various forms of computations, and this makes it at least possible that
we are such machines. So you can no longer say, "Look. Physical things
just can't do that" because we know physical things can do a lot and
this opens up the possibility that humans are physical things, in
particular, that humans are brains.</p>

<p>Finally, there is strong evidence that the brain is involved in
mental life. Somebody who hold a--held a dualist view that said that
what we do and what we decide and what we think and what we want are
all have nothing to do with the physical world, would be embarrassed by
the fact that the brain seems to correspond in intricate and elaborate
ways to our mental life. Now, this has been known for a long time.
Philosophers and psychologists knew for a long time that getting
smacked in the head could change your mental faculties; that diseases
like syphilis could make you deranged; that chemicals like caffeine and
alcohol can affect how you think. But what's new is we can now in
different ways see the direct effects of mental life.</p>

<p>Somebody with a severe and profound loss of mental faculties--the
deficit will be shown correspondingly in her brain. Studies using
imaging techniques like CAT scans, PET, and fMRI, illustrate that
different parts of the brain are active during different parts of
mental life. For instance, the difference between seeing words, hearing
words, reading words and generating words can correspond to different
aspects of what part of your brain is active. To some extent, if we put
you in an fMRI scanner and observed what you're doing in real time, by
looking at the activity patterns in your brain we can tell whether you
are thinking about music or thinking about sex. To some extent we can
tell whether you're solving a moral dilemma versus something else. And
this is no surprise if what we are is the workings of our physical
brains, but it is extremely difficult to explain if one is a
dualist.</p>

<p>Now, so what you have is--the scientific consensus is that all of
mental life including consciousness and emotions and choice and
morality are the products of brain activities. So, you would expect
that when you rip open the skull and look at the brain; you'd see
something glorious, you'd see – I don't know – a big, shiny thing with
glass tubes and blinding lights and sparks and wonderful colors. And
actually though, the brain is just disgusting. It looks like an old
meat loaf. It's gray when you take it out of the head. It's called gray
matter but that's just because it's out of the head. Inside the head
it's bright red because it's pulsing with blood. It doesn't even taste
good. Well, has anybody here ever eaten brain? It's good with cream
sauce but everything's good with cream sauce.</p>

<p>So, the question is, "How can something like this give rise to us?"
And you have to have some sympathy for Descartes. There's another
argument Descartes could have made that's a lot less subtle than the
ones he did make, which is "That thing responsible for free will and
love and consciousness? Ridiculous." What I want to do, and what the
goal of neuroscience is, is to make it less ridiculous, to try to
explain how the brain works, how the brain can give rise to thought,
and what I want to do today is take a first stab at this question but
it's something we'll continue to discuss throughout the course as we
talk about different aspects of mental life. What I want to do though
now is provide a big picture. So, what I want to do is start off small,
with the smallest interesting part of the brain and then get bigger and
bigger and bigger – talk about how the small part of the brain, the
neurons, the basic building blocks of thought, combine to other mental
structures and into different subparts of the brain and finally to the
whole thing.</p>

<p>So, one of the discoveries of psychology is that the basic unit of
the brain appears to be the neuron. The neuron is a specific sort of
cell and the neuron has three major parts, as you could see illustrated
here [pointing to the slide]. Neurons actually look quite different
from one another but this is a typical one. There are the dendrites –
these little tentacles here. And the dendrites get signals from other
neurons. Now, these signals can be either excitatory, which is that
they raise the likelihood the neuron will fire, or inhibitory in that
they lower the likelihood that the neuron will fire. The cell body sums
it up and you could view it arithmetically. The excitatory signals are
pluses, the inhibitory ones are minuses. And then if you get a certain
number, plus 60 or something, the neuron will fire and it fires along
the axon, the thing to the right. The axon is much longer than the
dendrites and, in fact, some axons are many feet long. There's an axon
leading from your spinal cord to your big toe for instance. [the
classroom lights accidentally go off] It is so shocking the lights go
out.</p>

<p>Surrounded--Surrounding--To complete a mechanical metaphor that
would have led Descartes to despair--[the classroom lights turn on]
Thank you, Koleen. Surrounding the axon is a myelin sheath, which is
actually just insulation. It helps the firing work quicker. So, here
are some facts about neurons. There are a lot of them – about one
thousand billion of them – and each neuron can be connected to around
thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, other neurons. So, it's an
extraordinarily complicated computing device. Neurons come in three
flavors. There are sensory neurons, which take information from the
world so as you see me, for instance, there are neurons firing from
your retina sending signals to your brain. There are motor neurons. If
you decide to raise your hand, those are motor neurons telling the
muscles what to do. And there are interneurons which connect the two.
And basically, the interneurons do the thinking. They make the
connection between sensation and action.</p>

<p>It used to be believed, and it's the sort of thing I would--when I
taught this course many years ago I would lecture on--that neurons do
not grow back once you lose them. You never get them back. This is
actually not true. There are parts of the brain in which neurons can
re-grow.</p>

<p>One interesting thing about neurons is a neuron is like a gun. It
either fires or it doesn't. It's all or nothing. If you squeeze the
trigger of a gun really hard and really fast, it doesn't fire any
faster or harder than if you just squeezed it gently. Now, this seems
to be strange. Why? How could neurons be all or nothing when sensation
is very graded? If somebody next to you pushed on your hand--the degree
of pushing--you'd be able to notice it. It's not either pushing or not
pushing. You can--Degrees of pushing, degrees of heat, degrees of
brightness. And the answer is, although neurons are all or nothing,
there are ways to code intensity. So, one simple way to code intensity
is the number of neurons firing; the more neurons the more intense.
Another way to increase intensity is the frequency of firing. So, I'll
just use those two. The first one is the number of neurons firing. The
second one is the frequency of firing in that something is more intense
if it's "bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang" then [louder] "bang, bang,
bang" and these are two ways through which neurons encode
intensity.</p>

<p>Now, neurons are connected and they talk to one another and it used
to be thought they were tied to one another like a computer, like you
take wires and you connect wires to each other, you wrap them around
and connect them. It turns out this isn't the case. It turns out that
neurons relate to one another chemically in a kind of interesting way.
Between any neurons, between the axon of one neuron and the dendrite of
another, there's a tiny gap. The gap could be about one ten-thousandths
of a millimeter wide. This infinitesimal gap--and this gap is known as
a synapse--and what happens is when a neuron fires, an axon sends
chemicals shooting through the gap. These chemicals are known as
neurotransmitters and they affect the dendrites. So, neurons
communicate to one another chemically. These--Again, the chemicals
could excite the other neuron (excitatory) bring up the chances it will
fire, or inhibit the other neuron (inhibitory).</p>

<p>Now, neurotransmitters become interesting because a lot of
psychopharmacology, both of the medical sort and the recreational sort,
consists of fiddling with neurotransmitters and so you could see this
through some examples. There are two sorts of ways you could fiddle
with neurotransmitters, and correspondingly two sorts of drugs. There
are agonists. And what an agonist does is increases the effect of
neurotransmitters, either by making more neurotransmitters or stopping
the cleanup of neurotransmitters, or in some cases by faking a
neurotransmitter, by mimicking its effects. Then, there are antagonists
that slow down the amount of neurotransmitters, either because they
destroy neurotransmitters or they make it hard to create more. Or in
some cases they go to the dendrite of the neuron and they kind of put a
paste over it so that the neurotransmitters can't connect. And it's
through these clever ways that neurons can affect your mental life.</p>

<p>So, for instance, there is a drug known as Curare and Curare is an
antagonist. It's a very particular sort of antagonist. It blocks motor
neurons from affecting muscle fibers. What this does then is it
paralyzes you because your motor neurons--You send the command to your
arm to stand, to lift up. It doesn't work. You send the command to your
leg to move. It doesn't work. The motor neurons are deactivated and
then, because the way you breathe is through motor neurons, you then
die.</p>

<p>There's alcohol. Alcohol is inhibitory. Now, this may be puzzling to
people. It's mildly paradoxical because you may be thinking, "alcohol
is not inhibitory. On the contrary, when I drink a lot of alcohol I
lose my inhibitions and become a more fun person. I become more
aggressive and more sexually vibrant and simply more beautiful. And so
in what way is alcohol inhibitory?" Well, the answer is it inhibits the
inhibitory parts of your brain. So, you have parts of your brain that
are basically telling you now, largely in the frontal lobes, that
are--"Okay. Keep your pants on. Don't hit me, buddy. Don't use bad
words." Alcohol relaxes, shuts down those parts of the brain. If you
take enough alcohol, it then goes down to inhibit the excitatory parts
of your brain and then you fall on the floor and pass out.</p>

<p>Amphetamines increase the amount of arousal. In particular, they
increase the amount of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that's
responsible for just general arousal. And so, amphetamines include
drugs like "speed" and "coke." There are--Prozac works on serotonin.
When we discuss clinical psychology and depression we'll learn the
extent to which neurotransmitter disorders are implicated in certain
disorders like depression. And one problem is that – for depression –
is that there's too little of a neurotransmitter known as serotonin.
Prozac makes serotonin more prevalent and so in some extent might help
alleviate depression. Parkinson's disease is a disease involving
destruction of motor control and loss of motor control, difficulty
moving. And one factor in Parkinson's is too little of a
neurotransmitter known as dopamine. The drug L-DOPA increases the
supply of dopamine and so there is something to alleviate, at least
temporarily, the symptoms of Parkinson's.</p>

<p>So, you have neurons and they're clustered together and they fire
and they communicate to one another. So, how does this all work to give
rise to creatures who could do interesting things like talk and think?
Well, again, it used to be believed that the brain is wired up like a
computer, like a PC or a Mac or something like that, but we know this
can't be true. It can't be true because there's two ways in which the
brain is better than a computer. For one thing, the brain is highly
resistant to damage. If you have a laptop and I persuade you to open it
up for me and I take the pliers and kind of snip just about anywhere,
your laptop will be destroyed but the brain is actually more resilient.
You can take a lot of brain damage and still preserve some mental
functioning. To some interesting sense, there's some sort of damage
resistance built in to the brain that allows different parts of the
brain to take over if some parts are damaged.</p>

<p>A second consideration is the brain is extremely fast. Your computer
works on wires and electricity but your brain uses tissue and tissue is
extremely slow. The paradox then is how do you create such a fast
computer with such slow stuff? And you can't. If the brain was wired up
like a personal computer, it would take you four hours to recognize a
face but, in fact, we could do things extremely quickly. So, the
question then is how is the brain wired up? And the answer is, unlike
manys, unlike commercially generated computers, the brain works through
parallel processing, massively parallel distributed processing.</p>

<p>There's a whole lot of research and this is research, some of which
takes place outside psychology departments and in engineering
departments and computer science departments, trying to figure out how
a computer can do the same things brains can do. And one way people do
this is they take a hint from nature and they try to construct
massively distributed networks to do aspects of reasoning. So, there's
a very simple computational network. That is interesting because it
kind of looks to some extent like the way neurons look and this is
often known as neural networks. And people who study this often claim
to be studying neural network modeling to try to build smart machines
by modeling them after brains. And in the last 20 years or so, this has
been a huge and vibrant area of study where people are trying to wire
up machines that can do brain-like things from components that look a
lot like neurons and are wired up together as neurons are. One
consideration in all of this is that this is a very young field and
nobody knows how to do it yet. There is no machine yet that can
recognize faces or understand sentences at the level of a two-year-old
human. There is no machine yet that can do just about anything people
can do in an interesting way. And this is, in part, because the human
brain is wired up in an extraordinarily more complicated way than any
sort of simple neural network. This is a sort of schematic diagram –
you're not responsible for this – of parts of the visual cortex, and
the thing to realize about this is it's extraordinarily simplified. So,
the brain is a complicated system.</p>

<p>Now, so, we've talked a little bit about the basic building blocks
of the brain – neurons. We've then talked about how neurons can
communicate to one another; then, [we] turned to how neurons are wired
up together. Now let's talk a little bit about different parts of the
brain. Now, there's some things you don't actually need your brain to
do. The study of what you don't need your brain to do has often drawn
upon this weird methodology where--This was actually done in France a
lot where they would decapitate people and when--After they decapitated
people, psychologists would rush to the body of the headless person and
sort of just test out reflexes and stuff like that. It's kind of
gruesome but we know there are some things you don't need your brain
for.</p>

<p>You don't need your brain for newborn sucking, limb flexation in
withdrawal from pain. Your limbs will pull back even if your head is
gone. Erection of the penis can be done without a brain. Vomiting also
is done without a brain. Oh. I need a volunteer. Very simple. This will
not involve any of--excellent--any of the above. Could you stand up
just--Okay. This is a new shirt so I want to stay away. Just--No. This
is--If you'll hold out your hand and--one hand flat. [The student holds
his hand out flat] Excellent. [Professor Paul Bloom raises a book above
the student's hand] That's the textbook, 5th edition. Now. [Professor
Paul Bloom drops the book onto the student's hand. After succumbing to
the weight of the book the student's hand automatically raises back up]
Perfect. What you'll notice is--Thank you very much. What you'll notice
is this hit and this hand went back up. This is something automatic,
instinctive, and does not require your brain. So your brain isn't
needed for everything.</p>

<p>What does your brain do? Well, some things that your brain does
involve very low-level internal structures. And these are called
subcortical structures because they're below the cortex. They're
underneath the cortex. So, for instance, what we have here [gesturing
toward the slides] is a diagram of the brain. The way to read this
diagram is it's as if it were my brain and I am facing this way. My
head gets cut in half down here and then you could see the brain. So,
this is the front over here. That's the back. Some key parts are
illustrated here. The medulla, for instance, is responsible for heart
rate and respiration. It's very deep within the brain and if it gets
damaged you could--you are likely to die. The cerebellum is responsible
for body balance and muscular coordination. And to give you, again, a
feeling for the complexity of these systems, the cerebellum contains
approximately 30 billion neurons. The hypothalamus is responsible here
for feeding, hunger, thirst, and to some extent sleep. And here is the
same brain parts in close-up.</p>

<p>Now, all of these parts of the brains are essential and many of them
are implicated in interesting psychological processes but where the
action is is the cortex. Isn't this beautiful? The cortex is the outer
layer and the outer layer is all crumpled up. Do you ever wonder why
your brain looks wrinkled? That's because it's all crumpled. If you
took out somebody's cortex and flattened it out, it would be two feet
square, sort of like a nice--like a rug. And the cortex is where all
the neat stuff takes place. Fish don't have any of that, so no offense
to fish but it's--fish don't have much of a mental life. Reptiles and
birds have a little bit about it--of it--and primates have a lot and
humans have a real lot. Eighty percent of the volume of our brain,
about, is cortex. And the cortex can be broken up into different parts
or lobes. There is the--And, again, this is facing in profile forward.
There is the frontal lobe, easy to remember. This part in front, the
parietal lobe, the occipital lobe, and the temporal lobe.</p>

<p>And one theme we're going to return to is--this is half the brain.
This is, in fact, the left half of the brain. On the other half, the
right half, everything's duplicated with some slight and subtle
differences. What's really weird--One really weird finding about these
lobes is that they include topological maps. They include maps of your
body. There is a cartoon which actually illustrates a classic
experiment by some physiologists who for some reason had a dog's brain
opened up and started shocking different parts of the brain. You could
do brain surgery while fully conscious because the brain itself has no
sense organs to it. And it turns out that the dog--When they zapped
part of its brain, its leg would kick up.</p>

<p>And it took Dr. Penfield at McGill University to do the same thing
with people. So, they were doing some brain surgery. He had a little
electrical thing just on--I don't know how he thought to do this. He
started zapping it and "boom." The person--Parts of their body would
move. More than that, when he zapped other parts of the brain, people
would claim to see colors. And he zapped other parts of the brain;
people would claim to hear sounds; and other parts of the brain, people
would claim to experience touch. And through his research and other
research, it was found that there are maps in the brain of the body.
There is a map in the motor part of the brain, the motor cortex, of the
sort up on the left and the sensory cortex of the sort that you could
see on the right and if you--and you could tell what's what by opening
up the brain and shocking different parts and those parts would
correspond to the parts of the body shown in the diagram there.</p>

<p>Now, two things to notice about these maps. The first is they're
topographical and what this means is that if two parts of the--two
parts are close together on the body, they'll be close together on the
brain. So, your tongue is closer to your jaw than it is to your hip in
the body; so too in both the motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex.
Also, you'll notice that the size of the body part represented in the
brain does not correspond to the size of the body part in the real
world. Rather, what determines the size in the brain is the extent to
which either they have motor command over it or sensory control. So,
there's a whole lot of sensory organs, for instance, focused along your
tongue, and that's why that's so big, and an enormous amount on your
face but your shoulder isn't even--doesn't even make it on there
because, although your shoulder might be bigger than your tongue,
there's not much going on. In fact, if you draw a diagram of a person,
what their body is corresponding to the amount of somatosensory cortex,
you get something like that [gesturing toward the slide]. That's your
sensory body.</p>

<p>Now, so, you have these maps in your head but the thing to realize
is--And these maps are part of your cortex, but the things to realize
is that's an important part of what goes on in your brain but less than
one quarter of the cortex contains these maps or projection areas. The
rest is involved in language and reasoning and moral thought and so on.
And, in fact, the proportion as you go from rat, cat, and monkey,
humans--less and less of it is devoted to projection and there is more
and more to other things. So, how do we figure out what the other parts
of the brain do? Well, there's all sorts of methods. Typically, these
are recent imaging methods like CAT scan and PET scan and fMRI which,
as I said before, show parts of your brain at work. If you want to know
which part of your brain is responsible for language, you could put
somebody into a scanner and have them exposed to language or do a
linguistic task or talk or something and then see what parts of their
brain are active.</p>

<p>Another way to explore what the brain does is to consider what
happens to people when very bad things happen to their brain. And these
bad things could happen through lesions, through tumors, through
strokes, through injury. For the most part, neuropsychologists don't
like helmet laws. Neuropsychologists love when motorcyclists drive
without helmets because through their horrible accidents we gain great
insights into how the brain works. And the logic is if you find
somebody--Crudely, if you find somebody with damage to this part of the
brain right here and that person can't recognize faces for instance,
there's some reason to believe that this part of the brain is related
to face recognition.</p>

<p>And so, from the study of brain damage and the study of--we can gain
some understanding of what different parts of the brain do. And so,
people study brain damages--brain damage that implicates motor control
such as apraxia. And what's interesting about apraxia is it's not
paralysis. Somebody with apraxia can move, do simple movements just
fine but they can't coordinate their movements. They can't do something
like wave goodbye or light a cigarette.</p>

<p>There is agnosia and agnosia is a disorder which isn't blindness
because the person could still see perfectly well. Their eyes are
intact but rather what happens in agnosia is they lose the ability to
recognize certain things. Sometimes this is described as psychic
blindness. And so, they may get visual agnosia and lose the ability to
recognize objects. They may get prosopagnosia and lose the ability to
recognize faces. There are disorders of sensory neglect, some famous
disorders. Again, it's not paralysis, it's not blindness, but due to
certain parts of your--of damaged parts of your brain, you might lose,
for instance, the idea that there's a left side of your body or a left
side of the world. And these cases are so interesting I want to devote
some chunk to a class in the next few weeks to discussing them.</p>

<p>There are disorders of language like aphasia. The classic case was
discovered by Paul Broca in 1861. A patient who had damage to part of
his brain and can only say one word, "tan," and the person would say,
"tan, tan, tan, tan," and everything else was gone. There's other
disorders of language such as receptive aphasia where the person could
speak very fluently but the words don't make any sense and they can't
understand anybody else. Other disorders that we'll discuss later on
include acquired psychopathy, where damage to parts of your brain,
particularly related to the frontal lobes, rob you of the ability to
tell right from wrong.</p>

<p>The final--I want to end--We're talking about neurons, connection
between neurons, how neurons are wired up, the parts of the brain, what
the different parts do. I want to end by talking about the two halves
of the brain and ask the question, "How many minds do you have?" Now,
if you look at the brain--If you took the brain out and held it up, it
would look pretty symmetrical, but it actually is not. There are actual
differences between the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere. How
many people here are right-handed? How many people here are
left-handed? How many people here are sort of complicated,
ambidextrous, don't know, "bit of the right, bit of left" people? Okay.
Those of you who are right-handed, which comprises about nine out of
ten people, have language in your left hemisphere. And, in fact, we're
going to be talking about right-handed people for the most part, making
generalizations in what I'll talk about now. Those of you who are
left-handed are more complicated. Some of you have language in your
right hemisphere, some in your left hemisphere, some God knows where.
It's complicated.</p>

<p>Now, the idea is that some things are duplicated. So, if you were to
lose half your brain, the other half can actually do a lot but some
things are more prevalent and more powerful in one part of the brain
than the other. And I want to show you a brief film clip from
"Scientific American" that illustrates the differences between the
hemispheres, but before doing that, I want to provide some introductory
facts. Some functions are lateralized. So, typically, language in the
left. Again, this is a right-handed centric thing but if you're
right-handed – language on the left, math and music on the right. There
is a crossover and this is important when we think about the studies
that will follow but the crossover is that everything you see in the
left visual field goes to the right side of your brain; everything in
the right visual field goes to the left side of the brain, and
similarly, there's a crossover in action. So, your right hemisphere
controls the left side of the body. Your left hemisphere controls the
right side of the body. Now, finally, the two halves are connected.
They're connected by this huge web called the corpus callosum. And I'm
just going to skip this because the movie illustration will go through
some of this.</p>

<p>This is an excellent summary of a discussion of Michael Gazzaniga,
who's one of the world's top neuroscientists and the leading expert on
the two halves of the brain. The only flaw in this movie is people are
just extremely pleased with themselves, so you have to ignore that
while watching it. Is that working? Do you people hear it?</p>

<p>[Professor Bloom plays a short video clip]</p>

<p>Now, I'll end on that happy note. This illustrates certain themes
that are discussed in detail in the Gray book, concerning the
lateralization of different parts of different mental capacities, some
in the left hemisphere, some in the right hemisphere. But it also
serves as a useful methodological development, which is a nice
illustration as to how looking at people who are incredibly unusual,
such as this man who had his brain bisected so his left hemisphere and
his right hemisphere don't communicate with one another--how looking at
such people, such extreme cases, can provide us with some understanding
of how we normally do things. And this, again, is a theme we'll return
to throughout the course.</p>

<p>This is generally the general introduction of the brain that I
wanted to provide, giving the framework for what I'll be talking about
later on throughout the course so that I might later on make reference
to neurons or neurotransmitters or the cortex or the left hemisphere
and you'll sort of have the background to understand what I'm talking
about. But I want to end this first real class with a bit of humility
as to what psychologists know and don't know. So, the idea behind a lot
of psychology – particularly a lot of neuroscience and cognitive
psychology – is to treat the mind as an information processor, as an
elaborate computer. And so, we study different problems like
recognizing faces or language or motor control or logic. The strategy
then often is to figure out how, what sort of program can solve these
problems and then we go on to ask, "How could this program be
instantiated in the physical brain?" So, we would solve--We study
people much as we'd study a computer from an alien planet or something.
And I think--This strategy is one I'm very enthusiastic about but there
still remains what's sometimes called the "hard problem" of
consciousness and this involves subjective experience. What's it like?
So, my computer can play chess. My computer can recognize numbers. It
can do math. And maybe it does it kind of the same way that I do it but
my computer doesn't have feelings in the same sense.</p>

<p>These are two classic illustrations. This [pointing at a picture on
the slide] is from a very old "Star Trek" episode. It illustrates
angst. I think a starship's about to go into the sun or something. And
that's [pointing at a another picture on the slide] my older kid, Max,
who's happy. And so the question is, "How does a thing like that give
rise to consciousness and subjective experience?" And this is a deep
puzzle. And although some psychologists and philosophers think they've
solved it, most of us are a lot more skeptical. Most of us think we
have so far to go before we can answer questions like Huxley's
question. Huxley points out, "How it is that anything so remarkable as
a state of consciousness comes about as a result of irritating nervous
tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djinn…" – of
the genie – "…when Aladdin rubs his lamp." It seems like magic that a
fleshy lump of gray, disgusting meat can give rise to these
feelings.</p>

<p>The second bit of humility we'll end the class on is I am presenting
here, and I'll be presenting throughout this semester, what you can
call a mechanistic conception of mental life. I'm not going to be
talking about how beautiful it is and how wonderful it is and how
mysterious it is. Rather, I'm going to be trying to explain it. I'm
going to be trying to explain fundamental aspects of ourselves
including questions like how do we make decisions, why do we love our
children, what happens when we fall in love, and so on.</p>

<p>Now, you might find this sort of project in the end to be repellant.
You might worry about how this, well, this meshes with humanist values.
For instance, when we deal with one another in a legal and a moral
setting, we think in terms of free will and responsibility. If we're
driving and you cut me off, you chose to do that. It reflects badly on
you. If you save a life at risk to your own, you're--you deserve
praise. You did something wonderful. It might be hard to mesh this with
the conception in which all actions are the result of neurochemical
physical processes. It might also be hard to mesh a notion such as the
purported intrinsic value of people. And finally, it might be hard to
mesh the mechanistic notion of the mind with the idea that people have
spiritual value.</p>

<p>Faced with this tension, there are three possibilities. You might
choose to reject the scientific conception of the mind. Many people do.
You may choose to embrace dualism, reject the idea that the brain is
responsible for mental life, and reject the promise of a scientific
psychology. Alternatively, you might choose to embrace the scientific
worldview and reject all these humanist values. And there are some
philosophers and psychologists who do just that, who claim that free
will and responsibility and spiritual value and intrinsic value are all
illusions; they're pre-scientific notions that get washed away in
modern science or you could try to reconcile them. You could try to
figure out how to mesh your scientific view of the mind with these
humanist values you might want to preserve. And this is an issue which
we're going to return to throughout the course. Okay. I'll see you on
Wednesday.</p>
