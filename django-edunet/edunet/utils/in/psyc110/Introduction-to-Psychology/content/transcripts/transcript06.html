<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: This class today is about language. And
language is, to a large extent, where the action is. The study of human
language has been the battleground over different theories of human
nature. So, every philosopher or psychologist or humanist or
neuroscientist who has ever thought about people has had to make some
claim about the nature of language and how it works. I'm including here
people like Aristotle and Plato, Hume, Locke, Freud and Skinner. I'm
also including modern-day approaches to computational theory, cognitive
neuroscience, evolutionary theory and cultural psychology. If you hope
to make it with a theory of what people are and how people work, you
have to explain and talk about language. In fact, language is
sufficiently interesting that, unlike most other things I'll talk about
in this class, there is an entire field devoted to its study, the field
of linguistics that is entirely devoted to studying the nuances and
structures of different languages.</p>

<p>Now, I'll first, before getting into details, make a definitional
point. When I'm talking about language I'm meaning systems like English
and Dutch and Warlpiri and Italian and Turkish and Urdu and what we've
seen and heard right now in class in the demonstration that preceded
the formal lecture. [Before class started, Professor Bloom had several
bilingual students give demonstrations of non-English speech.] Now, you
could use language in a different sense. You could use the term
"language" to describe what dogs do, or what chimpanzees do, or birds.
You could use language to describe music, talk about the--a musical
language or art, or any communicative system, and there's actually
nothing wrong with that. There's no rule about how you're supposed to
use the word "language." But the problem is if you use the word
"language" impossibly, incredibly broadly, then from a scientific point
of view it becomes useless to ask interesting questions about it. If
language can refer to just about everything from English to traffic
signals, then we're not going to be able to find interesting
generalizations or do good science about it.</p>

<p>So, what I want to do is, I want to discuss the scientific notion of
language, at first restricting myself to systems like English and Dutch
and American sign language and Navajo and so on. Once we've made some
generalizations about language in this narrow sense, we could then ask,
and we will ask, to what extent do other systems such as animal
communication systems relate to this narrower definition. So we could
ask, in this narrow sense, what properties do languages have and then
go on to ask, in a broader sense, what other communicative systems also
possess those properties.</p>

<p>Well, some things are obvious about language so here are some; here
are the questions we will ask. This will frame our discussion today.
We'll first go over some basic facts about language. We'll talk about
what languages share, we'll talk about how language develops, and we'll
talk about language and communication in nonhumans.</p>

<p>I began this class with a demonstration of--that illustrates two
very important facts about language. One is that languages all share
some deep and intricate universals. In particular, all languages, at
minimum, are powerful enough to convey an abstract notion like this;
abstract in the sense that it talks about thoughts and it talks about a
proposition and spatial relations in objects. There's no language in
the world that you just cannot talk about abstract things with. Every
language can do this. But the demonstration [before class] also
illustrated another fact about language, which is how different
languages are. They sound different. If you know one language, you
don't necessarily know another. It's not merely that you can't
understand it. It could sound strange or look unusual in the case of a
sign language. And so, any adequate theory of language has to allow for
both the commonalities and the differences across languages. And this
is the puzzle faced by the psychology and cognitive science of
language.</p>

<p>Well, let's start with an interesting claim about language made by
Charles Darwin. So, Darwin writes, "Man has an instinctive tendency to
speak, as we see in the babble of our young children, while no child
has an instinctive tendency to bake, brew or write." And what Darwin is
claiming here, and it's a controversial and interesting claim, is that
language is special in that there's some sort of propensity or capacity
or instinct for language unlike the other examples he gives. Not
everything comes natural to us but Darwin suggests that language
does.</p>

<p>Well, why should we believe this? Well, there are some basic facts
that support Darwin's claim. For one thing, every normal--every human
society has language. In the course of traveling, cultures encounter
other cultures and they often encounter cultures that are very
different from their own. But through the course of human history,
nobody has ever encountered another group of humans that did not have a
language. Does this show that it's built in? Well, not necessarily. It
could be a cultural innovation. It could be, for instance, that
language is such a good idea that every culture comes across it and
develops it. Just about every culture uses some sort of utensils to eat
food with, a knife and a fork, chopsticks, a spoon. This probably is
not because use of eating utensils is human nature, but rather, it's
because it's just a very useful thing that cultures discover over and
over again. Well, we know that this probably is not true with regard to
language. And one reason we know this is because of the demonstrated
case studies where a language is created within a single generation.
And these case studies have happened over history.</p>

<p>The standard example is people involved in the slave trade. The
slave trade revolving around tobacco or cotton or coffee or sugar would
tend to mix slaves and laborers from different language backgrounds, in
part deliberately, so as to avoid the possibility of revolt. What would
happen is these people who were enslaved from different cultures would
develop a makeshift communication system so they could talk to one
another. And this is called a "pidgin," p-i-d-g-i-n, a pidgin. And this
pidgin was how they would talk. And this pidgin was not a language. It
was strings of words borrowed from the different languages around them
and put together in sort of haphazard ways.</p>

<p>The question is what happens to the children who are raised in this
society. And you might expect it that they would come to speak a
pidgin, but they don't. What happens is, in the course of a single
generation, they develop their own language. They create a language
with rich syntax and morphology and phonology, terms that we'll
understand in a few minutes. And this language that they create is
called a "creole." And languages that we know now as creoles, the word
refers back to their history. That means that they were developed from
pidgins. And this is interesting because this suggests that to some
extent the ability to use and understand and learn language is part of
human nature. It doesn't require an extensive cultural history. Rather,
just about any normal child, even when not exposed to a full-fledged
language, can create a language.</p>

<p>And more recently, there's been case studies of children who acquire
sign language. There's a wonderful case in Nicaragua in sign language
where they acquire sign language from adults who themselves are not
versed in sign language. They're sort of second-language learners
struggling along. What you might have expected would be the children
would then use whatever system their adults use, but they don't. They
"creolized" it. They take this makeshift communication system developed
by adults and, again, they turn it into a full-blown language,
suggesting that to some extent it's part of our human nature to create
languages.</p>

<p>Also, every normal human has language. Not everybody in this room
can ride a bicycle. Not everybody in this room can play chess. But
everybody possesses at least one language. And everybody started to
possess at least one language when they were a child. There are
exceptions, but the exceptions come about due to some sort of brain
damage. Any neurologically normal human will come to possess a
language.</p>

<p>What else do we know? Well, the claim that language is part of human
nature is supported by neurological studies, some of which were
referred to in the chapters on the brain that you read earlier that
talk about dedicated parts of the brain that work for language. And if
parts of these brains--if parts--if these parts of the brain are
damaged you get language deficits or aphasias where you might lose the
ability to understand or create language. More speculatively, there has
been some fairly recent work studying the genetic basis of language,
looking at the genes that are directly responsible for the capacity to
learn and use language. And one bit of evidence that these genes are
implicated is that some unfortunate people have point mutations in
these genes. And such people are unable to learn and use language.</p>

<p>So, in general, there is some support, at least at a very broad
level, for the claim that language is in some sense part of human
nature. Well, what do we mean by language? What are we talking about
when we talk about language? We don't want to restrict ourselves, for
instance, to English or French. What do all languages share? Well, all
languages are creative and this means a couple of things.</p>

<p>One meaning is the meaning emphasized by Rene Descartes. When Rene
Descartes argued that we are more than merely machines, his best piece
of evidence for him was the human capacity for language. No machine
could do this because our capacity for language is unbounded and free.
We could say anything we choose to say. We have free will. And in fact,
language allows us to produce a virtual infinity of sentences. So, we
could create and understand sentences that we never heard before. And
there are a lot of sentences. So, if you want to estimate how many
grammatical sentences under twenty words in English, the answer is, "a
lot." And what this means is that any theory of language use and
language comprehension cannot simply appeal to a list. When you
understand a sentence I said you have to have the capacity to
understand a sentence even if you've never heard it before. And this is
because we could effortlessly produce and understand sentences that no
human has ever said before on earth.</p>

<p>Would anybody volunteer to say a sentence, non obscene, non
derogatory, that has never been spoken before on earth, ever? Here.
I'll start. "It's surprisingly easy to get a purple tie on eBay if you
don't care much about quality." I could imagine no one else in the
world has said this before. "I am upset that one cannot easily download
'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' through iTunes." Now, it's possible somebody
said both these sentences before, but you probably have not heard them.
But you understand them immediately. So, how do you do it? Well, you
have rules in your head. You've learnt what the words mean, but you
have abstract and unconscious rules that take these words, figure out
the order, and in a fraction of a second, give rise to understanding.
And that's the sort of thing linguists study.</p>

<p>So, take some standard examples from the linguistic study of
English. And bear in mind the rules we're talking about here are not
rules you explicitly know. They're automatic rules of the same sort
we're going to talk about in the context of visual perception in that
they're implicit and unconscious and not accessible to explicit
understanding. So for instance, immediately you read "The pig is eager
to eat" versus "The pig is easy to eat" and in a fraction of a second
you know there's an important difference. "The pig is eager to eat"
means the state of affairs that we're talking about is when the pig
does the eating. "The pig is easy to eat" is when the pig is being
eaten.</p>

<p>You would see a sentence like "Bill knew that John liked him" and
you know, without even knowing how you know, that this could mean that
Bill knew that John liked Bill or it could mean that Bill knew that
John liked Fred. But it can't mean that Bill knew that John liked John.
The natural interpretation, in fact, is that Bill knew that John liked
Bill. The two words co-refer. Contrast that with "Bill knew that John
liked himself," which only has the meaning Bill knew that John liked
John. And this is what linguists do for a living so if you hear me
talking about this and say, "I want to spend the next forty years of my
life studying that," you should become a linguist. But that's the sort
of--those are the sort of phenomena that we're interested in.</p>

<p>Now, it gets more complicated. Those are examples from syntax, but
language has many structures. Language has structures going from the
bottom to the top. All languages--All human languages have phonology,
which is the system of sounds or signs; morphology, which is the system
of words or morphemes, basic units of meaning; and syntax, which refer
to rules and principles that put together words and phrases into
meaningful utterances. And I want to talk briefly about each of these
three parts of language before looking at some other issues. I'm
indebted here to Steven Pinker's excellent book <i>The Language
Instinct</i> which provides, I think, a superb discussion of these
phenomena. And I'm going to steal some of my examples from Pinker.</p>

<p>So, phonology. Phonology is the system of sounds that languages
have. There's a subset. There's a list, a finite list, of possible
sounds that language can use. I'm going to put aside for the moment the
question of sign languages and how they work. I'm going to talk about
them in a little bit. The idea is that English has about forty of these
phonemes. So, if you're a native monolingual speaker of English you
hear speech and each sound you hear is categorized as falling into one
of those forty morphemes--sorry, phonemes. So, for example, English has
a phoneme of "lu," "l," and a phoneme of "r." And so, an English
speaker can hear the difference between "lip" and "rip" and that
corresponds to two different words in English. Other languages don't
have that distinction and so those distinctions are very difficult for
non-native English speakers to learn.</p>

<p>So, part of what goes on when you learn, is you have to learn the
language--the phonemes that your language has. Another part of the
problem of learning language is you have to figure out what the
boundaries are between the words. You have to use sound signals to
figure out the boundaries between the words. Now that--If the only
language you've ever heard is English, that's going to seem like a
really weird example of a problem because you're listening to me speak
and in between each of my words you're hearing a pause. You don't have
to be very smart to figure out where one word begins and one word ends.
But the pause is a psychological illusion. If you were to just talk
into an oscilloscope that measured your sound vibrations, there are no
pauses between the words. Rather, the pauses are inserted by your mind
as you already know where one word begins and another one ends. And you
insert a pause at that point.</p>

<p>You could see this when you hear a language you don't already know.
So, for those of you who have never heard French before, when you hear
somebody say, "Je ne sais pas" you could say, "Remarkable! French has
no pauses between words." And you-- And now a French speaker, of
course, hears "Je ne sais pas." For Hebrew, I know one sentence in
Hebrew: "Sleecha, eypho ha-sheeruteem" which I think is a request for
the bathroom. But if you don't know Hebrew there's no pauses. And the
truth is, when you each gave your demonstrations, nobody spoke properly
because nobody spoke--Here's the sentence: "Glorp [pause] fendel
[pause] smug [pause] wuggle." Rather, you all sounded like,
"blublublublublub" without any pauses because I don't know your
languages.</p>

<p>Children come into the world without knowing any specific language
and so they have to learn pauses. They have to learn to interpret
sounds in context and sometimes they make mistakes. They get problems
of segmentation. And there are some illustrations. You could see their
mistakes if they're trying to repeat back something that's already
known within a society. So, songs are a good example. These are
excerpts from children. [misunderstood lyrics from songs] "I'll never
be your pizza burnin'." Anybody know--figure out what that corresponds
to?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [I'll never be your] Beast of burden?</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom: "</b>Beast of burden." Very good. [reading
another misunderstood song lyric off of the slide] "A girl with colitis
goes by." Somebody?</p>

<p><b>Student: "</b>A girl with kaleidoscope eyes."</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> "The ants are my friends; they're
blowin' in the wind." And [laughter] this is a religious one. "Our
father with Bart in heaven; Harold be they name… Lead us not into Penn
Station…"</p>

<p>Now, phonological understanding illustrates all sorts of aspects of
language processing and, in fact, of consciousness. Because remember I
said that, typically, when you hear a sentence you make--you
manufacture in your mind gaps between the words. Typically, when
there's something which is unclear you'll fill in the gap and figure
out what the word is. And you'll hear it that way. So, the few
examples--The best examples, again, are for when it goes wrong.</p>

<p>So, a classic example is from the song "Super Freak" by Rick James.
I got a big lecture about copyright laws and this is going to violate
most of them. Rick James is going to be sitting on the--at--staring at
the web two years from now saying, "Hey. That's my thing." Okay. So, I
want you to listen to this line. I'm sure most of you have heard this
before but I want you to listen closely. [music playing] What was that
last line? [laughter] "The kind of girl you read about--" Well, it
turns out that nobody really knows. And it sounds to many people who do
top-down interpretation as--to me as well, that "she's the kind of girl
you read about in <i>Newsweek</i> magazine." But that makes no sense at
all given that you don't want to "bring home to Mama." [referring to a
song lyric] And she's--and it's not the--and in fact, if you check the
notes on the song, she's in fact, "the kind of girl you read about in
new wave magazines." Now, when you listen to it then, again, knowing
that, you hear it that way. [music playing]</p>

<p>Now, this top-down--This is known as "top-down" processing. Top-down
processing is an example of when you know what something is you hear it
that way. And this is extremely useful when it comes to filling in gaps
in sounds. In normal conversation, if I'm to say "s-- [coughs] entence"
you won't hear that as "s-- [cough] entence." Rather, you hear
"sentence." You fill in the gap. This can lead to problems. The problem
it's led to in my life revolves around the song "Get Crunk" [laughter]
because I've heard "Get Crunk" and my children asked me if I would buy
them "Get Crunk" from iTunes. My children are eight and ten. And now
"Get Crunk," as I was aware from having heard it before, involves the
consistent refrain of "get crunk" extremely bad word, "get crunk"
extremely bad word, and so I said "no." And then they said, "Well,
there's a clean version of it." So, I downloaded the clean version.
Unfortunately, knowing what the clean version--knowing what the word is
means to me the clean version is not very clean. Now, I will add,
[laughter] before people write letters and stuff, this is the clean
version. [The music plays, but even though the expletives are censored
out you still perceive them as being there] [laughter] Thank goodness
they took away that obscene word. [laughter]</p>

<p>Okay. So, top-down processing affects how we hear things, usually,
almost always, for the better. And in fact, this is a theme we're going
to return to next class when we talk about vision because the same
thing is going to happen there. How we see the world is often confusing
and befuddled but what we know can clear things up. Same with
sound.</p>

<p>Morphology is the next level up. Phonology is sounds. Morphology is
words. And human language uses this amazing trick described by
Ferdinand de Saussure, the great linguist, as "the arbitrariness of the
sign." And what this means is we can use--take any arbitrary idea in
the world, the idea of a chair or a story or a country, and make a
sound or a sign to connect to it. And the link is arbitrary. You might
choose to use a word for "dog" as "woof woof" because it sounds like a
dog but you can't use a word for "country" that sounds like a country.
You could use a sign language thing for "drink" that looks sort of like
the act of drinking but you can't use a sign language word for
"country" that looks like a country, or for "idea" that looks like an
idea.</p>

<p>So, the way languages work is it allows for arbitrary naming. It
allows for this map between a symbol, say a spoken word, and any sort
of thought we want to use. And those arbitrary mappings, as we come to
learn them, make up the vocabulary of a language. I'm talking about
words but the more technical term is "morpheme." And what a morpheme is
is the smallest meaningful unit in a language. Now often, this is the
same thing as a word. So, "dog" is a word. And "dog" is also a
morpheme, but not always because there are single morphemes and then
there are words that are composed of many morphemes. So, "dogs" and
"complained" are one word, but two morphemes and what this means is
that you make the word by putting together two morphemes. To put it
differently, in order to know what "dogs" means, you never had to learn
the word "dogs." All you had to know is the word "dog" and the plural
morpheme 's' and you could put them together to create a word.</p>

<p>How many morphemes does the average speaker know? The answer is
fairly startling. The average speaker knows, as a low-ball estimate,
about 60,000 words. I think the proper estimate is closer to 80,000 or
100,000. What this means, if you average it out, is that since children
start learning their first words at about their first year of life,
they learn about nine new words a day. And it's not a continuous nine
words every day. It goes up and down depending on the age. But still,
the amount of words we know is staggering. How many of you know more
than one language pretty fluently? Those of you who know other
languages might have in your heads 200,000 words or 300,000 words and
you're accessing them in a fraction of a second. It is--could
legitimately be seen as one of the most astonishing things that people
do.</p>

<p>Finally, syntax. So, we have the sound system of a language, the
phonology. We have the words of a language, the morphology, but all
that gives you is "dog," "cup," "chair," "house," "story," "idea." That
won't allow us to communicate complicated ideas. So, the final step in
the story is syntax. And syntax refers to those rules and principles
that allow us to combine words into phrases and phrases into sentences.
And syntax uses another neat trick and this is defined by Wilhelm von
Humboldt as the "infinite use of finite media." So, here's the
question. Your vocabulary is finite. There are just so many words. You
have to learn them one by one, but you could produce a virtual infinity
of sentences. How can you do that? How can you go from a finite list of
symbols to an infinite number of sentences? And the answer is you have
a combinatorial system.</p>

<p>Now, language is not the only thing in culture or nature that has
this sort of combinatorial system. Music also has a combinatorial
system. There's a finite number of notes but a limitless number of
musical compositions. DNA also has this sort of combinatorial system
where you have a finite number of, I guess, bases or amino acids that
could combine to a possible infinity of strings, of DNA strings. So,
how does this happen? Well, the infinity mechanism, and many of you
will be familiar with this from mathematics or computer science, is
recursion. And there's a lot to be said about this but it could be
pretty simply illustrated in language.</p>

<p>So, here's an example of a simple language. It's not--It's actually
close to how linguists describe normal languages, but it's very simple.
It has three nouns, "Fred," "Barney" and "Wilma," and two verbs,
"thinks" and "likes." A very simple language. And one rule. And the way
to read this rule is you make a sentence by taking a noun, any noun,
putting a verb after it, and then following that verb with a noun. Now,
when you do this, how many--And then so, for instance, you get the
sentence "Fred likes Wilma." When you do this, how many possible
sentences are there?</p>

<p>Let me just take a second. Okay. Any guesses? Eighteen. The
sentences are "Fred likes Fred," "Fred likes Barney," "Fred likes
Wilma," "Fred thinks Fred," "Fred thinks Barney," "Fred thinks Wilma,"
and so on. The three nouns followed by any of the two verbs followed by
any of the three nouns. That is not a very interesting language. But
now, take a more complicated language--same vocabulary, the same three
nouns, the same two verbs, the same sentence, but now one other
sentence. This sentence expands to a noun followed by a verb followed
by a sentence and there you get recursion. You have one rule invoking
another rule and then you can get a sentence like "Fred thinks Barney
likes Wilma." And here you get a potential infinity of sentences.</p>

<p>And this is obviously a toy example but you could see the use of
recursion in everyday life and in everyday use of language. You could
say, "John hates cheese," "My roommate heard a rumor that John hates
cheese," "It disturbed Mary when I told her that my roommate heard a
rumor that John hates cheese," "I was amazed that it disturbed Mary
when I told her that my roommate heard a rumor that John hates cheese,"
"Professor Bloom had devoted way too much of his lecture talking about
how I was amazed [laughter] that it disturbed Mary when I told her that
my roommate heard a rumor that John hates cheese," "It really bothered
me that--" and there's no limit. There's no longest sentence. You could
keep producing a sentence deeper and deeper embedded until you die. And
this is part of the power of language.</p>

<p>Now, the syntactic rules are complicated. And one of the puzzles of
syntactic rules, or one of the issues of them, is that different rules
can conspire to create the same sentence. So, you take a sentence
like--This is a classic line from Groucho Marx: "I once shot an
elephant in my pajamas. How it got into my pajamas I'll never know."
And the humor, such that it is, revolves around the ambiguity of rules
that generate it, like this versus like this. Often, to illustrate the
issues of ambiguity, people have collected poorly thought-out headlines
in newspaper reports that play on--that inadvertently have ambiguity.
"Complaints about NBA referees growing ugly." So, that's the beauty of
that structure. "Kids make nutritious snacks." "No one was injured in a
blast which was attributed to the buildup of gas by one town official."
Last summer I was in Seoul visiting the--visiting Korea University and
the big headline there on the front page was "General arrested for
fondling privates." [laughter]</p>

<p>Now, there actually is--The ambiguity is actually quite difficult to
avoid in the construction and understanding of sentences. It's one of
the ways in which it's often difficult to write clearly, and in fact,
there's a whole sub-field of the law involving the use of linguistic
theory to disambiguate sentences both in the Constitution, in
legislation, as well as in some criminal cases.</p>

<p>And there was, several years ago, a very serious criminal case that
rested on a sentence. And here's what happened. There were two
brothers, one of them retarded, and they get into a robbery. And a
police officer sees them and points the gun at them. And one of the
brothers points a gun at the police officer. The police officer shouts
for the brother, the non-retarded brother, to drop the gun. Actually,
he said, "Give me the gun." The retarded brother shouted, "Let him have
it," whereupon the brother shot and killed the police officer. Now, the
brother who did the shooting was plainly a murderer. What about that
brother who shouted, "Let him have it"? Well, it depends on what he--on
how you interpret that sentence because the sentence is beautifully
ambiguous. It could mean "shoot him, let him have it," or it could mean
"give him the gun, let him have it." And in fact, the trial, which I
think somebody could--If people out there know about this, please send
me an e-mail. My understanding was he was found guilty but a lot to
turn on the ambiguity of a sentence.</p>

<p>I want to shift now and talk about where does all this knowledge
come from but I'll stop and answer any questions about the material so
far. What are your questions? Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> How does syntax differ from grammar or are they
exactly the same?</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Syntax--The question is, "How is syntax
different from grammar?" They're exactly the same. Syntax is a more
technical term but it means the same thing as grammar. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> You said that every normal human being that's born
uses at some point or another some kind of language. Aren't there
people who weren't born within a culture and grew up and who never
really spoke a language though they were physically normal?</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Yes. I'm glad you actually asked me
about that because, as I said it, I realized it wasn't quite right. The
point that was just raised here is I had said before that everybody
who's neurologically normal comes to acquire and learn a language. But
what about people who are neurologically normal but they don't have
language around them? And in fact, there have been, historically, some
cases of this. There's been, probably apocryphal, stories about
children who are raised by wolves or by dogs. There are stories,
horrible stories, some in the twentieth century, about children who are
locked away by insane or evil parents and have never learned to speak.
There are stories of deaf people who are within certain societies where
nobody signs to them, and so they're what's known as linguistic
isolates. And they themselves never learn to speak. And those cases are
the dramatic exception and they do tell you something.</p>

<p>They tell you that it's not enough to have a brain for language.
Somebody does have to use it with you. Interestingly, it doesn't have
to be that many people. So, Susan Goldin-Meadow has studied deaf
children that nobody signed to but what she studies is deaf children
with deaf siblings and these children don't just sit there. They create
their own language. It's not a full-blown language like American
sign-language or <i>langue des signes quebecoise</i> but it's a
language nonetheless, with words and syntax and phonology. It's an
interesting question. Any other questions? Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Could it be argued that there are inherent limits to
grammar?</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> It's a good question. The question is,
"Are there inherent limits in our abilities to come up with grammars?"
And most linguists would argue "yes," that languages are highly
constrained in how they do things. So, for instance, one example is
there's no language in the world that ever constructs a question by
switching the order of words around in a sentence. There's no language
in the world that has a rule that says the fifth word has to be a verb.
And linguists have all of these conditions they say, "no language in
the world works this way." Now this is--;So, these are constraints on
grammar and they're really interesting because they tell us what's a
humanly natural language versus what's not a humanly natural language.
But notice, even if there is incredible constraints on grammars,
still--we could still produce an infinite number of sentences. It's
just like if you restrict me to only a subset of numbers, only the odd
numbers, still there's an infinity of odd numbers. So, grammar can be
restricted but still give rise to an infinity of possible
sentences.</p>

<p>Well, there's a radical claim about the origin of language
associated with the guy who we met when we talked about behaviorism who
wrote <i>A Review of Verbal Behavior,</i> the linguist Noam Chomsky.
And Chomsky makes this radical claim. And this is that we shouldn't
view language learning as learning at all. Instead, we should view it
as something similar to growth. So he says,</p>

<blockquote>No one would take seriously the proposal that a human
organism learns through experience to have arms rather than wings, or
that the basic structure of particular organs results from accidental
experience. [Language] proves to be no less marvelous and intricate
than these physical structures. Why, then, should we not study the
acquisition of a cognitive structure like language more or less as we
study some complex bodily organ?</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So, you might learn to play baseball, you might learn about the
American Civil War, but if Chomsky is right you didn't learn to speak
English. Rather, what happened is you heard English and--but the
capacity grew in your head and something a lot more similar to the
development of arms or legs or a visual system.</p>

<p>Well, should we believe this? We know there has to be some effect of
the environment shaping language, obviously, because in order to know
English you have to have heard English, in order to know Dutch you have
had to heard, to--had to have learned and heard Dutch. And in fact,
languages differ in all the ways that we were talking about. Some
languages like English has a--have a distinction between ‘l' and ‘r.'
Other languages do not. For a language like English, that creature
there is referred to with the morpheme "dog." That's a historical
accident of English. In French it's <i>chien</i> and in Greek it's
something else. And each of those 6,000 languages and people in the
room who know another language would say, "Yeah, in Vietnamese it's
this," "In Urdu it's this," "In Czech it's that."</p>

<p>Finally, there is syntax. So, English is what's known as a
subject-verb-object language. That means if you want to convey the idea
that Bill hit John, you would say, "Bill hit John." But not all
languages work that way. In fact, the majority of languages, more
languages, are actually subject-object-verb languages. So, you would
say, if you wanted to convey that Bill was the hitter and John was hit,
"Bill John hit." All of this has to be learned. And all of this has to
be learned through exposure to language users.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is considerable evidence that the
development of these language skills, in some way, is similar to growth
in the way that Chomsky suggests. So, here are some basic facts about
language development. One is something which I had mentioned before.
All normal children learn language. There can be specific impairments
of language. Now, again, we spoke about them before when talking about
the brain. Some of these impairments could be due to trauma, the
aphasias. Trauma, a blow to the head, a stroke can rid you of your
language. But, also, there are genetic disorders, some falling under
the rubric of what's known as "specific language impairment," where
children are born without the same ability as the rest of us to learn
to speak. And these are interesting in many ways.</p>

<p>One reason that they're interesting is that they illustrate
something about human language. It is not--It would not be unreasonable
for you to think before listening to his lecture, "Look. All you need
to have to learn a language is to be smart" or "All you need to have to
learn a language is to want to communicate" or "All you need to have to
learn a language is to be a social person wanting to--having the
ability to understand others and deal with others." But the cases of
specific language impairments suggest that all of that is wrong,
because there are children in this world right now who are plenty
smart, who really want to communicate, and who are entirely social
creatures but they can't learn language. And this suggests that the
ability to learn language and understand language is to some extent
separate from these other aspects of mental life.</p>

<p>Continuing on this theme, we also know that language is learnt
without any sort of feedback or training. There are many Americans who
believe that they need to teach their children language. And there's a
huge industry with DVDs and flash cards and all sorts of things
designed to teach your children language. And I think many parents
believe that if they didn't persist in using these things their
children would never learn to speak. But we know that that's not true.
We know that this isn't true because there are communities where they
don't speak to their kids. They don't speak to their kids because they
don't believe it's important to speak to their kids. Some linguists
would interview--Linguists would interview adults in these communities
and say, "Why don't you speak to your babies?" And these adults would
respond, "It'd be ridiculous to speak to a baby. The baby has nothing
to say. You might as well just speak to your dog." And then the
American linguist would say, "Yeah. We speak to our dogs." [laughter]
Americans and Europeans speak to everything and everybody. Other
cultures are more picky and they don't talk to their children until
their children themselves are talking. This doesn't seem to make much
of a difference in language learning.</p>

<p>Some studies have, motivated by Chomsky's work in expressed--sorry,
motivated by Chomsky's critique of Skinner's <i>Verbal Behavior,</i>
have asked even in-- "What if we just looked at children within the
United States? Don't these children get feedback?" And the answer is
yes and no. So your average highly educated Western parent does give
their children feedback--do give their children feedback based on what
they say. But they don't typically give feedback based on the syntax or
grammaticality of what they say.</p>

<p>The example given by Brown and Hanlon in the classic study in the
1970s is they did all of these studies looking at what children say and
how parents responded, and it turns out parents respond not to the
grammatical correctness but to the affect or cuteness or sociability of
the utterance. So for instance, if a child says to his mother, "I loves
you, Mommy," it's a very unusual parent who would say, "Oh, no. The
verb agreement is mistaken. [laughter] You've added a redundant ‘s.'
It's not appropriate." Similarly, if a child is to say, "I hate your
guts, Mother," it's an unusual mother, "That's wonderful. There's a
subject, verb, object. The whole thing's structurally fine." We respond
to our kids like we respond to each other based on the message that's
conveyed, not the grammaticality of the utterances. Children make
grammatical mistakes all the time but then they go away and they go
away without correction. So those are some basic facts.</p>

<p>What do we know about the time course of language? Well, early on
children start off and they prefer the melody of their own language.
These studies were done in France with four-day-old babies. And what
they did was they used a sucking method. Remember, there's a limited
number of things babies can do. One of the things they can do is suck,
and these babies would suck on a pacifier to hear French. And they
would prefer to hear French than to hear Russian. And these
investigators claimed this is because they had been exposed to French
in the first four days of their lives. Reviewers, mostly from France,
objected and said, "No. Maybe French just sounds better. Everybody's
going to like French." So, they re-did the study in Russia. Russian
kids sucked harder to hear Russian than they did to French.</p>

<p>And what they're listening to isn't the words. They don't know words
yet. They don't know of syntax yet. It's the rhythm of the language.
For you, French and Russian sound different. Even if you're like me and
you don't know a word of either language, they still sound different.
They sound different to babies too. And a baby being raised in France
or a baby being raised in Russia knows enough to tell what's his
language and what isn't.</p>

<p>Early on, children are sensitive to every phoneme there is. So,
English-speaking children, for instance, can--English-speaking babies –
babies who are born in the United States – can distinguish between
English phonemes like "lip" and "rip" but they could also distinguish
between phonemic contrasts that are not exemplified in English, such as
phonemic contrasts in Czech or Hindi. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: I'm wondering if you can say the wrong things to
them--to infants based on what you were saying before. Because I was in
France one summer and I had some neighbors there. I hated these
neighbors, I thought they were stupid. Not because they were French,
but they had a baby and it would gaggle and coo and they would respond
in similar terms.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> They would gaggle and coo back at the
baby.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible] And I hate these people. [inaudible] So
I don't know if it--Does it matter what you say to babies as long as
you say something.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> There's a lot going on in your
question. [laughter] Some raising--Well, there's a lot going on in your
question. The answer to the question-- The question was, "your baby's
going to coo and 'ga ga, goo goo,' does it matter if you coo and 'ga
ga, goo goo' back?" No, it doesn't make a difference. Your hatred
towards them was unmotivated. You can be relieved of that debt, or now
you know you feel bad now, I guess. [laughter] If you speak to your
children in perfect English, it's very strange. Nobody speaks to their
babies in, "Hello, Son. It's time--Oh. You want to change your diaper
right now so stay still." That's bad parenting. It sounds kind of
silly. More--What most people do is, "Oh. You're such a cute little
baby." And it probably--One--There's--Evolutionary psychologists debate
the function of why we talk funny to babies. And some people have
argued that it does help their language learning. And some people have
argued instead that what it does is it calms them. They like to hear
the music of a smooth voice and so on. But whether or not you do so
doesn't seem to make a big difference.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to find any effect of how parents talk to their
kids on how their kids learn language, particularly when it comes to
babies. So, early on babies can--are sensitive to all phonemes and then
that goes away. Around twelve months of age it goes away. This is one
thing you were much better at when you were a baby than you are now.
When you were a baby you were a multilingual fool. You could understand
the sound differences of every language on earth. Now, if you're like
me, you could barely understand English. [laughter] You narrow down
until you're sensitive just to the language you hear. And this
narrowing down is largely in place by about twelve months of age.</p>

<p>Around seven months is babbling. And I want to stop at this point to
go back to the issue--I promised you I would turn a bit to sign
language and I want to describe now a very elegant--I want to show a
little film now of a very elegant series of experiments looking at the
question of whether babies who are exposed to a sign language,
babble.</p>

<p>[film plays]</p>

<p>One of the real surprising findings in my field over the last
ten/twenty years has been that the acquisition of sign languages has
turned out to be almost exactly the same; in fact, as far as we know,
exactly the same as the acquisition of spoken languages. It didn't have
to be that way. It could have been just as reasonable to expect that
there'd be an advantage for speech over sign. That sign languages may
be full-blown languages but they just take--they're just harder to
learn because the brain and the body have adapted for speech. It turns
out that this just isn't the case. It turns out that sign and--the
developmental milestones of sign languages and the developmental
milestones of spoken languages are precisely the same. They start
babbling at the same point. They start using first words, first
sentences, first complicated constructions. There seems to be no
interesting difference between how the brain comes to acquire and use
the spoken language versus a sign language.</p>

<p>Around twelve months of age, children start using their first words.
These are words for objects and actions like "dog" and "up" and "milk."
They start showing some sensitivity to the order of words. So they know
that "dog bites cat" is different from "cat bites dog." Around eighteen
months of age, they start learning words faster. They start producing
little, miniature sentences like "Want cookie" or "Milk spill" and the
function morphemes, the little words, "in," "of," "a," "the," and so on
start to gradually appear.</p>

<p>Then the--Then there's the bad news. Around seven years of age going
up through puberty, the ability to learn language starts to go away.
The best work on this has been done by Elissa Newport and Sam Supalla
who have studied people who have been in the United States for many,
many years – 30, 40 years – and seeing how well they have come to speak
English. And it turns out the big determinant of how well you speak
English as an immigrant isn't how smart you are. It's not how many
family members you have when you're here. It's not your motivation.
It's how old you were when you started.</p>

<p>It turns out that if you start learning a language – a second
language is where most of the work's been done – within the first few
years of life you're fine. You'll speak like a native. But then it
starts getting worse and worse. And once you hit puberty, suddenly
there's huge variation in the abilities you have to learn language. It
is very rare, for instance, for somebody who has learned English past
puberty to speak without an accent. An accent is very hard to shake and
it's not just an accent. It's also other aspects of phonology, syntax,
and morphology. It's like the part of the brain that's responsible for
language learning is only around early in development and if you don't
get your language by then it'll just run out.</p>

<p>I want to begin next class with this question, the question of
animals. And that will shut down the language learning part. But one
thing I'll put up here is your second reading response. So, I'll also
put this up on Wednesday, and by Wednesday you might have a bit of a
better--be in a better position to answer this question. But I'll
continue with language on Wednesday and then we'll also talk about
vision, attention, and memory. I'll see you then.</p>
