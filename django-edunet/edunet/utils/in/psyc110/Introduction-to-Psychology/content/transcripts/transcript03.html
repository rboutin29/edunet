<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: Okay. The last class we talked about
the brain. Now we're going to talk a little bit about some foundations.
So today and Monday we're going to talk about two very big ideas and
these ideas are associated with Sigmund Freud and B. F. Skinner and are
psychoanalysis and behaviorism. And I want to talk about psychoanalysis
today and behaviorism next week.</p>

<p>Now, one of these things--One of the things that makes these
theories so interesting is their scope. Most of the work we're going to
talk about in this class--Most of the ideas are narrow. So, we're going
to talk about somebody's idea about racial prejudice but that's not a
theory of language acquisition. We'll talk about theories of
schizophrenia but they're not explanations of sexual attractiveness.
Most theories are specialized theories but these two views are grand
theories. They're theories of everything, encompassing just about
everything that matters, day-to-day life, child development, mental
illness, religion, war, love. Freud and Skinner had explanations of all
of these.</p>

<p>Now, this is not a history course. I have zero interest in
describing historical figures in psychology just for the sake of
telling you about the history of the field. What I want to tell you
about though is--I want to talk about these ideas because so much rests
on them and, even more importantly, a lot of these ideas have critical
influence on how we think about the present. And that's there.
[pointing at the slide]</p>

<p>Now, for better or worse, we live in a world profoundly affected by
Sigmund Freud. If I had to ask you to choose a--no, name a famous
psychologist, the answer of most of you would be Freud. He's the most
famous psychologist ever and he's had a profound influence on the
twentieth and twenty-first century. Some biographical information: He
was born in the 1850s. He spent most of his life in Vienna, Austria,
but he died in London and he escaped to London soon after retreating
there at the beginning of World War II as the Nazis began to occupy
where he lived.</p>

<p>He's one of the most famous scholars ever but he's not known for any
single discovery. Instead, he's known for the development of an
encompassing theory of mind, one that he developed over the span of
many decades. He was in his time extremely well known, a celebrity
recognized on the street, and throughout his life. He was a man of
extraordinary energy and productivity, in part because he was a very
serious cocaine addict, but also just in general. He was just a
high-energy sort of person. He was up for the Nobel Prize in medicine
and in literature; didn't get either one of them; didn't get the prize
in medicine because Albert Einstein--Everybody loves Albert Einstein.
Well, Albert Einstein really wrote a letter because they asked for
opinions of other Nobel Prizes. He wrote a letter saying, "Don't give
the prize to Freud. He doesn't deserve a Nobel Prize. He's just a
psychologist." Well, yeah. Okay.</p>

<p>While he's almost universally acclaimed as a profoundly important
intellectual figure, he's also the object of considerable dislike. This
is in part because of his character. He was not a very nice man in many
ways. He was deeply ambitious to the cause of promoting psychoanalysis,
to the cause of presenting his view and defending it, and he was often
dishonest, extremely brutal to his friends, and terrible to his
enemies. He was an interesting character.</p>

<p>My favorite Freud story was as he was leaving Europe during the rise
of the Nazis, as he was ready to go to England from, I think, either
Germany or Austria, he had to sign a letter from the Gestapo. Gestapo
agents intercepted him and demanded he sign a letter saying that at no
point had he been threatened or harassed by the Gestapo. So he signs
the letter and then he writes underneath it, "The Gestapo has not
harmed me in any way. In fact, I highly recommend the Gestapo to
everybody." It's--He had a certain aggression to him. He was also--He's
also disliked, often hated, because of his views. He was seen as a
sexual renegade out to destroy the conception of people as good and
rational and pure beings. And when the Nazis rose to power in the 1930s
he was identified as a Jew who was devoted to destroying the most
sacred notions of Christianity and to many, to some extent, many people
see him this way. And to some extent, this accusation has some truth to
it.</p>

<p>Freud made claims about people that many of us, maybe most of us,
would rather not know. Well, okay. What did he say? Well, if you ask
somebody who doesn't like Freud what he said, they'll describe some of
the stupider things he said and, in fact, Freud said a lot of things,
some of which were not very rational. For instance, he's well known for
his account of phallic symbols, arguing certain architectural monuments
are subconsciously developed as penile representations. And related to
this, he developed the notorious theory of penis envy. And penis envy
is an account of a developmental state that every one of you who is
female has gone through, according to Freud. And the idea is that you
discovered at some point in your development that you lacked a penis.
This is not--This is a catastrophe. And so, each of you inferred at
that point that you had been castrated. You had once had a penis but
somebody had taken it from you. You then turn to your father and love
your father because your father has a penis, so he's a sort of penis
substitute. You reject your mother, who's equally unworthy due to her
penis lack, and that shapes your psychosexual development.</p>

<p>Now, if that's the sort of thing you know about Freud, you are not
going to have a very high opinion of him or of his work, but at the
core of Freud's declamation, the more interesting ideas, is a set of
claims of a man's intellectual importance. And the two main ones are
this. The two main ones involve the existence of an unconscious,
unconscious motivation, and the notion of unconscious dynamics or
unconscious conflict which lead to mental illnesses, dreams, slips of
the tongue and so on.</p>

<p>The first idea – the idea of unconscious motivation – involves
rejecting the claim that you know what you're doing. So, suppose you
fall in love with somebody and you decide you want to marry them and
then somebody was asked to ask you why and you'd say something like,
"Well, I'm ready to get married this stage of my life; I really love
the person; the person is smart and attractive; I want to have kids"
whatever. And maybe this is true. But a Freudian might say that even if
this is your honest answer – you're not lying to anybody else –still,
there are desires and motivations that govern your behavior that you
may not be aware of. So, in fact, you might want to marry John because
he reminds you of your father or because you want to get back at
somebody for betraying you.</p>

<p>If somebody was to tell you this, you'd say, "That's total
nonsense," but that wouldn't deter a Freudian. The Freudian would say
that these processes are unconscious so of course you just don't know
what's happening. So, the radical idea here is you might not know
what--why you do what you do and this is something we accept for things
like visual perception. We accept that you look around the world and
you get sensations and you figure out there is a car, there is a tree,
there is a person. And you're just unconscious of how this happens but
it's unpleasant and kind of frightening that this could happen, that
this could apply to things like why you're now studying at Yale, why
you feel the way you do towards your friends, towards your family.</p>

<p>Now, the marriage case is extreme but Freud gives a lot of simpler
examples where this sort of unconscious motivation might play a role.
So, have you ever liked somebody or disliked them and not known why?
Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you're doing
something or you're arguing for something or making a decision for
reasons that you can't fully articulate? Have you ever forgotten
somebody's name at exactly the wrong time? Have you ever called out the
wrong name in the throes of passion? This is all the Freudian
unconscious. The idea is that we do these things--these things are
explained in terms of cognitive systems that we're not aware of.</p>

<p>Now, all of this would be fine if your unconscious was a reasonable,
rational computer, if your unconscious was really smart and looking out
for your best interest. But, according to Freud, that's not the way it
works. According to Freud, there are three distinct processes going on
in your head and these are in violent internal conflict. And the way
you act and the way you think are products, not of a singular rational
being, but of a set of conflicting creatures. And these three parts are
the id, the ego, and the superego and they emerge developmentally.</p>

<p>The id, according to Freud, is present at birth. It's the animal
part of the self. It wants to eat, drink, pee, poop, get warm, and have
sexual satisfaction. It is outrageously stupid. It works on what Freud
called, "The Pleasure Principle." It wants pleasure and it wants it
now. And that's, according to Freud, how a human begins – pure id.
Freud had this wonderful phrase, "polymorphous perversity," this pure
desire for pleasure.</p>

<p>Now, unfortunately, life doesn't work like that. What you want isn't
always what you get and this leads to a set of reactions to cope with
the fact that pleasure isn't always there when you want it either by
planning how to satisfy your desires or planning how to suppress them.
And this system is known as the ego, or the self. And it works on the
"Reality Principle." And it works on the principle of trying to figure
out how to make your way through the world, how to satisfy your
pleasures or, in some cases, how to give up on them. And the ego – the
emergence of the ego for Freud--symbolizes the origin of
consciousness.</p>

<p>Finally, if this was all there it might be a simpler world, but
Freud had a third component, that of the superego. And the superego is
the internalized rules of parents in society. So, what happens in the
course of development is, you're just trying to make your way through
the world and satisfy your desires, but sometimes you're punished for
them. Some desires are inappropriate, some actions are wrong, and
you're punished for it. The idea is that you come out; you get in your
head a superego, a conscience. In these movies, there'd be a little
angel above your head that tells you when things are wrong. And
basically your self, the ego, is in between the id and the
superego.</p>

<p>One thing to realize, I told you the id is outrageously stupid. It
just says, "Oh, hungry, food, sex, oh, let's get warm, oh." The
superego is also stupid. The superego, point to point, is not some
brilliant moral philosopher telling you about right and wrong. The
superego would say, "You should be ashamed of yourself. That's
disgusting. Stop doing that. Oh." And in between these two screaming
creatures, one of you; one of them telling you to seek out your
desires, the other one telling you, "you should be ashamed of
yourself," is you, is the ego.</p>

<p>Now, according to Freud, most of this is unconscious. So, we see
bubbling up to the top, we feel, we experience ourselves. And the
driving of the id, the forces of the id and the forces of the superego,
are unconscious in that we cannot access them. We don't know what--It's
like the workings of our kidneys or our stomachs. You can't introspect
and find them. Rather, they do their work without conscious
knowledge.</p>

<p>Now, Freud developed this. This is the Freudian theory in broad
outline. He extended it and developed it into a theory of psychosexual
development. And so, Freud's theory is, as I said before, a theory of
everyday life, of decisions, of errors, of falling in love, but it's
also a theory of child development. So, Freud believed there were five
stages of personality development, and each is associated with a
particular erogenous zone. And Freud believed, as well, that if you
have a problem at a certain stage, if something goes wrong, you'll be
stuck there. So, according to Freud, there are people in this room who
are what they are because they got stuck in the oral stage or the anal
stage. And that's not good.</p>

<p>So, the oral stage is when you start off. The mouth is associated
with pleasure. Everything is sucking and chewing and so on. And the
problem for Freud is premature weaning of a child. Depriving him of the
breast, could lead to serious problems in his personality development.
It could make him, as the phrase goes, into an oral person. And his
orality could be described literally. Freud uses it as an explanation
for why somebody might eat too much or chew gum or smoke. They're
trying to achieve satisfaction through their mouth of a sort they
didn't get in this very early stage of development. But it can also be
more abstract. If your roommate is dependent and needy, you could then
go to your roommate and say, "You are an oral person. The first year of
your life did not go well."</p>

<p>A phrase even more popular is the anal stage and that happens after
the oral stage. And problems can emerge if toilet training is not
handled correctly. If you have problems during those years of life, you
could become an anal personality, according to Freud, and your roommate
could say, "Your problem is you're too anal." And, according to Freud,
literally, it meant you are unwilling to part with your own feces. It's
written down here. I know it's true. And the way it manifests itself,
as you know from just how people talk, is you're compulsive, you're
clean, you're stingy. This is the anal personality.</p>

<p>Then it gets a little bit more complicated. The next stage is the
phallic stage. Actually, this is not much more complicated. The focus
of pleasure shifts to the genitals and fixation can lead to excessive
masculinity in females or in males or if you're female a need for
attention or domination. Now, at this point something really
interesting happens called the "Oedipus Complex." And this is based on
the story, the mythical story of a king who killed his father and
married his mother. And, according to Freud, this happens to all of us
in this way. Well, all of us. By "all of us," Freud meant "men."</p>

<p>So, here's the idea. You're three or four years old. You're in the
phallic stage. So, what are you interested in? Well, you're interested
in your penis and then you seek an external object. Freud's sort of
vague about this, but you seek some sort of satisfaction. But who is
out there who'd be sweet and kind and loving and wonderful? Well, Mom.
So the child infers, "Mom is nice, I love Mom." So far so--And so this
is not crazy; a little boy falling in love with his mother. Problem:
Dad's in the way.</p>

<p>Now, this is going to get progressively weirder but I will have to
say, as the father of two sons, both sons went through a phase where
they explicitly said they wanted to marry Mommy. And me – if something
bad happened to me that wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. So,
there's this. But now it gets a little bit aggressive. So, the idea is
the child determines that he's going to kill his father. Every three-
and four-year-old boy thinks this. But then because children, according
to Freud, don't have a good sense of the boundary between their mind
and the world, which is a problem – the problem is they don't – they
think their father can tell that they're plotting to kill him and they
figure their father is now angry at them. And then they ask themselves,
"What's the worst thing Dad could do to me?" And the answer is
castration. So, they come to the conclusion that their father is going
to castrate them because of their illicit love for their Mom. And then
they say, "Dad wins" and then they don't think about sex for several
years and that's the latency stage.</p>

<p>The latency stage is they've gone through this huge thing with Mom
and Dad, "fell in love with Mom, wanted to kill my father, Dad was
going to castrate me, fell out of love with Mom, out of the sex
business." And then, sex is repressed until you get to the genital
stage. And the genital stage is the stage we are all in – the healthy
adult stage. Now that you're adults and you've gone through all the
developmental stages, where do you stand? You're not out of the woods
yet because unconscious mechanisms are still--Even if you haven't got
fixated on anything, there's still this dynamic going on all the time
with your id, your ego and your superego. And the idea is your
superego--Remember, your superego is stupid. So, your superego isn't
only telling you not to do bad things, it's telling you not to think
bad things. So, what's happening is your id is sending up all of this
weird, sick stuff, all of these crazy sexual and violent desires, "Oh,
I'll kill him. I'll have sex with that. I'll have extra helpings on my
dessert." And your superego is saying, "No, no, no." And this stuff is
repressed. It doesn't even make it to consciousness.</p>

<p>The problem is Freud had a very sort of hydraulic theory of what
goes on and some of this stuff slips out and it shows up in dreams and
it shows up in slips of the tongue. And in exceptional cases, it shows
up in certain clinical symptoms. So what happens is, Freud described a
lot of normal life in terms of different ways we use to keep that
horrible stuff from the id making its way to consciousness. And he
called these "defense mechanisms." You're defending yourself against
the horrible parts of yourself and some of these make a little bit of
sense.</p>

<p>One way to describe this in a non-technical, non-Freudian way is,
there are certain things about ourselves we'd rather not know. There
are certain desires we'd rather not know and we have ways to hide them.
So, for instance, there's sublimation. Sublimation is you might have a
lot of energy, maybe sexual energy or aggressive energy, but instead of
turning it to a sexual or aggressive target what you do is you focus it
in some other way. So, you can imagine a great artist like Picasso
turning the sexual energy into his artwork.</p>

<p>There is displacement. Displacement is you have certain shameful
thoughts or desires and you refocus them more appropriately. A boy
who's bullied by his father may hate his father and want to hurt him
but since this would--this is very shameful and difficult. The boy
might instead kick the dog and think he hates the dog because that's a
more acceptable target.</p>

<p>There is projection. Projection is, I have certain impulses I am
uncomfortable with, so rather than own them myself, I project them to
somebody else. A classic example for Freud is homosexual desires. The
idea is that I feel this tremendous lust towards you, for instance,
and--any of you, all of you, you three, and I'm ashamed of this lust so
what I say is, "Hey. Are you guys looking at me in a sexual manner? Are
you lusting after me? How disgusting," because what I do is I take my
own desires and I project it to others. And Freud suggested, perhaps
not implausibly, that men who believe other men--who are obsessed with
the sexuality of other men, are themselves projecting away their own
sexual desires.</p>

<p>There is rationalization, which is that when you do something or
think something bad you rationalize it and you give it a more socially
acceptable explanation. A parent who enjoys smacking his child will
typically not say, "I enjoy smacking my child." Rather he'll say, "It's
for the child's own good. I'm being a good parent by doing this."</p>

<p>And finally, there is regression, which is returning to an earlier
stage of development. And you actually see this in children. In times
of stress and trauma, they'll become younger, they will act younger.
They might cry. They might suck their thumb, seek out a blanket or so
on. Now, these are all mechanisms that for Freud are not the slightest
bit pathological. They are part of normal life. Normally, we do these
things to keep an equilibrium among the different systems of the
unconscious, but sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes things go awry
and what happens is a phrase that's not currently used in psychology
but was popular during Freud's time: hysteria.</p>

<p>Hysteria includes phenomena like hysterical blindness and hysterical
deafness, which is when you cannot see and cannot hear even though
there's nothing physiologically wrong with you – paralysis, trembling,
panic attacks, gaps of memory including amnesia and so on. And the idea
is that these are actually symptoms. These are symptoms of mechanisms
going on to keep things unconscious. It's a common enough idea in
movies. Often in movies what happens is that somebody goes to an
analyst. They have some horrible problem. They can't remember something
or they have some sort of blackouts and so on. And the analyst tells
them something and at one point they get this insight and they realize
what--why they've blinded themselves, why they can't remember, and for
Freud this is what happens. Freud originally attempted to get these
memories out through hypnosis but then moved to the mechanism of free
association and, according to Freud, the idea is patients offer
resistance to this and then the idea of a psychoanalyst is to get over
the resistance and help patients get insight.</p>

<p>The key notion of psychoanalysis is your problems are--actually
reflect deeper phenomena. You're hiding something from yourself, and
once you know what's going on to deeper phenomena your problems will go
away. I'm going to give you an example of a therapy session. Now, this
is not a Freudian analysis. We'll discuss later on in the course what a
Freudian analysis is, but this is not a pure Freudian analysis. A
Freudian analysis, of course, is lying on a couch; does not see their
therapist; their therapist is very nondirective. But I'm going to
present this as an example here because it illustrates so many of the
Freudian themes, particularly themes about dreams, the importance of
dreams, about repression and about hidden meaning.</p>

<p>So, this is from a television episode and the
character's--Many--Some of you may have seen this. Many of you will not
have. The character is suffering from panic attacks. [Professor Paul
Bloom plays a short episode from the Sopranos]</p>

<p>Freud's contributions extend beyond the study of individual
psychology and individual pathology. Freud had a lot to say about
dreams as you could see in this illustration. He believed that dreams
had a manifest content, meaning; "manifest" meaning what you experience
in your dream. But dreams always had a latent content as well, meaning
the hidden implication of the dream. He viewed all dreams as wish
fulfillment. Every dream you have is a certain wish you have even
though it might be a forbidden wish that you wouldn't wish to have, you
wouldn't want to have. And dreams had--and this is an idea that long
predated Freud. Dreams had symbolism. Things in dreams were often not
what they seemed to be but rather symbols for other things. Freud
believed that literature and fairy tales and stories to children and
the like carried certain universal themes, certain aspects of
unconscious struggles, and certain preoccupations of our unconscious
mind. And Freud had a lot to say about religion. For instance, he
viewed a large part of our--of the idea of finding a singular,
all-powerful god as seeking out a father figure that some of us never
had during development.</p>

<p>What I want to spend the rest of the class on is the scientific
assessment of Freud. So, what I did so far is I've told you what Freud
had to say in broad outline. I then want to take the time to consider
whether or not we should believe this and how well it fits with our
modern science. But before doing so, I'll take questions for a few
minutes. Do people have any questions about Freud or Freud's theories?
Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: So, that's some question. The question
is: The conflicts in psychosexual development that Freud describes
is--always assumes that a child has a mother and a father, one of each,
in a certain sort of familial structure. And the question then is,
"What if a child was raised by a single parent, for example?" What if a
child was never breast fed, but fed from the bottle from the start? And
Freudians have had problems with this. Freud's--Freud was very focused
on the family life of the people he interacted with, which is rather
upper class Europeans, and these sort of questions would have been
difficult for Freud to answer. I imagine that what a Freudian would
have to say is, you would expect systematic differences. So, you would
expect a child who just grew up with a mother or just grew up to be a
father--with a father to be in some sense psychologically damaged by
that, failing to go through the normal psychosexual stages. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: The issue--The question is, "Do modern
psychoanalysts still believe that women do not have superegos?" Freud
was--As you're pointing out, Freud was notorious for pointing, for
suggesting that women were morally immature relative to men. I think
Freud would say that women have superegos, they're just not the sort of
sturdy ones that men have. I think psychoanalysts and psychoanalytic
scholars right now would be mixed. Some would maintain that there
really are deep sex differences. Others would want to jettison that
aspect of Freudian theory. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Do you define sublimation as being displacement?
Does that make it sort of a subgroup of displacement?</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: Well, what sublimation is--A lot of
these--It's a good question. The question is sort of, what is
sublimation? How does it relate to the other defense mechanisms? A lot
of defense mechanisms involve taking a desire and turning it. Now, what
displacement does is it takes it from you to her. I'm angry at you but
maybe that's forbidden for some reason, so I'll be angry at her. What
projection does is takes a desire from me and then puts it on somebody
else heading outwards. And what sublimation does is it just gives up
the details and keeps the energy. So, you stay up--Your roommate stays
up all night working and you say to your roommate, for instance,
"That's just because you haven't had sex in a long time and you want to
have sex so you devote all your energy to your math exam." And then you
say, "That's sublimation. I learned that in Intro Psych." And your
roommate would be very pleased. One more question. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: What kind of evidence is there for cross-cultural
variation?</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: The question is, which is related to
the issue--extending the issue of the two-parent versus one-parent
family is, "To what extent are these notions validated
cross-culturally?" And that's such a good question I'm going to defer
it. I'm going to talk about it in a few minutes because that's
actually--That speaks to the issue of the scientific assessment of
Freud so I'm going to try to get to your question in a little bit.</p>

<p>Freudian theory is now, at this point of time, extremely
controversial and there is a lot of well-known criticisms and attacks
on Freud. This is just actually an excellent book on <i>The Memory
Wars</i> by Frederick Crews, which--and Frederick Crews is one of the
strongest and most passionate critics of Freud. And the problems with
Freud go like this. There are two ways you could reject a theory. There
are two problems with the scientific theory. One way you could reject a
theory is that it could be wrong. So, suppose I have a theory that the
reason why some children have autism, a profound developmental
disorder, is because their mothers don't love them enough. This was a
popular theory for many years. It's a possible theory. It just turns
out to be wrong but another way--And so one way to attack and address a
scientific theory is to view it as just to see whether or not it works.
But there's a different problem a theory could have. A theory could be
so vague and all encompassing that it can't even be tested. And this is
one of the main critiques of Freud. The idea could be summed up by a
quotation from the physicist Wolfgang Pauli. And Pauli was asked his
opinion about another physicist. And Pauli said this: "That guy's work
is crap. He's not right. He's not even wrong." And the criticism about
Freud is that he's not even wrong.</p>

<p>The issue of vagueness is summarized in a more technical way by the
philosopher Karl Popper who described--who introduced the term of
falsifiability. The idea of falsifiability is that what distinguishes
science from non science is that scientific predictions make strong
claims about the world and these claims are of a sort that they could
be proven wrong. If they couldn't be proven wrong, they're not
interesting enough to be science. So, for example, within psychology
the sort of claims we'll be entertaining throughout the course include
claims like, damage to the hippocampus causes failures of certain sorts
of memory, or everywhere in the world men on average want to have more
sexual partners than women, or exposure to violent television tends to
make children themselves more violent. Now, are they true or are they
false? Well, we'll talk about that, but the point here is they can be
false. They're interesting enough that they can be tested and as such
they go to--they might be wrong but they graduate to the level of a
scientific theory.</p>

<p>This should be contrasted with nonscientific programs and the best
example of a nonscientific program is astrology. So, the problem with
astrological predictions is not that they're wrong. It's that they
can't be wrong. They're not even wrong. I did my--I got my horoscope
for today on the web. [reading from a slide] "A couple of negative
aspects could make you a little finicky for the next few days." Okay.
I'm going to watch for that. "The presence of both Mars and Venus
suggests you want to box everything into a neat, ordered, structured
way but keeping a piece of jade or carnelian close will help you keep
in touch with your fun side." And starting this morning I got from my
wife a little piece of jade and I have been sort of in touch with my
fun side. The problem is, a few days aren't going to go by and say,
"God. That was wrong." It can't be wrong. It's just so vague. I got a
better horoscope from <i>The Onion</i> actually: "Riding in a golf cart
with snow cone in hand, you'll be tackled by two police officers this
week after matching a composite caricature of a suspected murderer."
Now, that's a good prediction because "wow." If it turns out to be
true, I'm going to say, "Those guys really know something." It's
falsifiable.</p>

<p>Arguably, Freud fails the test because Freudian theory is often so
vague and flexible that it can't really be tested in any reliable way.
A big problem with this is a lot of Freudian theory is claimed to be
validated in the course of psychoanalysis. So, when you ask people,
"Why do you believe in Freud?" they won't say, "Oh, because of this
experiment, that experiment, this data set and that data set." What
they'll say is, "It's--The Freudian theory proves itself in the course
of psychoanalysis – the success of psychoanalysis." But it's
unreliable. The problem is, say, Freud says to a patient, "You hate
your mother." The patient says, "Wow. That makes sense." Freud says,
"I'm right." The patient--Freud says, "You hate your mother," and the
patient says, "No, I don't. That's titillating. That's disgusting."
Freud says, "Your anger shows this idea is painful to you. You have
repressed it from consciousness. I am right."</p>

<p>And the problem is the same sort of dynamic plays itself out even in
the scientific debate back and forth. So Freud--Freudian
psychologists--I'm putting Freud here but what I mean is well-known
defenders of Freud will make some claims like: adult personality traits
are shaped by the course of psychosexual development; all dreams are
disguised wish fulfillment; psychoanalysis is the best treatment for
mental disorders. Scientists will respond, "I disagree. There's little
or no evidence supporting those claims." And the Freudian response is,
"Your rejection of my ideas shows that they are distressing to you.
This is because I am right." And this is often followed up, seriously
enough. "You have deep psychological problems."</p>

<p>And now, I don't want to caricature Freudians. A lot of Freudians
have tried and made a research program of extending their ideas
scientifically, bringing them to robust scientific tests. But the
problem is, when you make specific falsifiable predictions they don't
always do that well. So, for instance, there's no evidence that oral
and anal characteristics, the personality characteristics I talked
about – about being needy versus being stingy – relate in any
interesting way to weaning or toilet training.</p>

<p>And there's been some efforts cross-culturally, to go back to the
question this young man asked before – looking at cross-cultural
differences in toilet training and weaning, which are really big
differences, to see if they correspond in any interesting way to
personality differences. And there's been no good evidence supporting
that. Similarly, Freud had some strong claims about sexuality, for why
some people are straight and others are gay. These have met with very
little empirical support. And the claim that psychoanalysis proves
itself by being--by its tremendous success in curing mental illness is
also almost certainly not true. For most--Maybe not all, but for most
psychological disorders, there are quicker and more reliable treatments
than psychoanalysis. And there's considerable controversy as to whether
the Tony Soprano method of insight, where you get this insight and
there's discovery, "Oh, now I know," makes any real difference in
alleviating symptoms such as anxiety disorders or depression.</p>

<p>This is why there's sort of--often sort of a sticker shock when
people go to a university psychology department where they say, "Look.
Hey. Where is--So I'm in Psych. How could I take classes on Freud?
Who's your expert on Freud?" And the truth is Freudian psychoanalysis
is almost never studied inside psychology departments. Not the
cognitive or developmental side, not the clinical side. There are some
exceptions but, for the most part, even the people who do study Freud
within psychology departments do so critically. Very few of them would
see themselves as a psychoanalytic practitioner or as a Freudian
psychologist.</p>

<p>Freud lives on both in a clinical setting and in the university but
Freud at Yale, for instance, is much more likely to be found in the
history department or the literature department than in the psychology
department. And this is typical enough but, despite all of the, sort
of, sour things I just said about Freud, the big idea, the importance
of the dynamic unconscious, remains intact. We will go over and over
and over again different case studies where some really interesting
aspects of mental life prove to be unconscious.</p>

<p>Now, there's one question. I'm actually going to skip over this for
reasons of time and just go to some examples of the unconscious in
modern psychology. So, here's a simple example of the unconscious in
modern psychology: Language understanding. So, when you hear a sentence
like, "John thinks that Bill likes him," in a fraction of a second you
realize that this means that John thinks that Bill likes John. If you
heard the sentence--Oops--"John thinks that Bill likes himself," in a
fraction of a second you would think that it means "John thinks that
Bill likes Bill." And as we will get to when we get to the lecture on
language, this is not conscious. You don't know how you do this. You
don't even know that you are doing this but you do it quickly and
instinctively.</p>

<p>So much of our day-to-day life can be done unconsciously. There are
different activities you can do – driving, chewing gum, shoelace tying
– where if you're good enough at them, if you're expert enough at them,
you don't know you're doing them. I was at a party a few years ago for
a friend of mine and we ran out of food so he said, "I'll just go pick
up some food." An hour later he was gone--still gone and it was around
the corner. And we called him up on his cell phone and he said, "Oh. I
got on the highway and I drove to work." Yeah. He works an hour away
but he got on the highway "drive drive drive." And these--some version
of these things happen all of the time.</p>

<p>Maybe more surprising, Freud's insight that our likes and dislikes
are due to factors that we're not necessarily conscious of has a lot of
empirical support--a lot of empirical support from research into social
psychology, for example. So, here's one finding from social psychology.
If somebody goes through a terrible initiation to get into a club,
they'll like the club more. You might think they'd like it less because
people do terrible things to them. But actually, hazing is illegal but
a remarkably successful tool. The more you pay for something the more
you like it and the more pain you go through to get something the more
you like it. From the standpoint of politics for instance, if you want
loyal people in a political campaign, do not pay them. If you pay them,
they'll like you less. If they volunteer, they'll like you more. And
we'll talk about why. There's different theories about why, but my
point right now is simply that people don't necessarily know this but
still they're subject to this.</p>

<p>Another example is some weird studies done in a discipline of social
psychology known as terror management which involves subliminal death
primes. The idea of subliminal death primes is this. You sign up for
your human subjects requirement and then you--they put you in front of
a computer screen and then they tell you, "Oh, just sit in front of the
computer screen and then we'll ask you some questions." And then the
questions come out and they're questions like, "How much do you love
your country?" "What do you think of Asians?" "What do you think of
Jews?" "What do you think of blacks?" "What do you think of
vegetarians?" "What do you think of people's political views different
from yours?"</p>

<p>Here's the gimmick. What you don't know is on that computer screen
words are being flashed like that but they're being flashed so fast it
looks like that--You don't see anything--words like "corpse," "dead,"
"dying." The flashing of these subliminal words, "subliminal" meaning –
a fancy term meaning below the level of consciousness, you don't know
you're seeing them – has dramatic effects on how you answer those
questions. People exposed to death primes become more nationalistic,
more patriotic, less forgiving of other people, less liking of other
races and people from other countries. Again the claim--the explanation
for why this is so is something which we'll get to in another class.
The point now is simply to illustrate that these sort of things can
have--that things you aren't aware of can have an effect on how you
think.</p>

<p>The final example I'll give of this is a short demonstration. To do
this, I'm going to cut the class in half at this point so you'll be on
this side of the class, the right side, my right, and this will be on
the left side, and I simply want everybody to think about somebody you
love. So, think about somebody you love, your girlfriend, your
boyfriend, your mom, your dad. Think about somebody you love. Just
think. Okay. Now, on this screen is going to be instructions but I want
to give the instructions to this half of the class [pointing to his
right]. I'm going to ask everybody in this half of the class [pointing
to his left] please either turn your head or shut your eyes. Okay?
Teaching fellows too. Okay. And everybody on this half obey [pointing
to his right]. Okay. Has everybody read that [pointing to the slide]?
Okay. Now, turn your head, this group [pointing to his right]. Now this
group [pointing to his left]: Look at this [pointing to instructions on
the slide] and take a moment. You don't have to do it on paper but take
a moment to do it in your head. You--Each group had instructions. Some
people might have seen both instructions. Follow the instructions you
got for you.</p>

<p>Now, this was research done by Norbert Schwarz and here's the
question I want you to ask yourself, "How much do you like this
person?" And here's the effect: Half of you were asked to list three
features of the person. Half of you were asked to list ten. The
finding, which is not a subtle finding, is that liking goes up in the
three group and liking goes down in the ten group. And here is why. I
have to think about three positive features of somebody so I think
about my girlfriend. I have a girlfriend. I think about my girlfriend,
"but oh, she's smart, she's beautiful and she's kind. Good. How much
do--What do I think of her? "Pretty, good, smart, beautiful, kind,
smart, beautiful, oh, yeah." But the problem--;Now, Schwarz is clever
though. He says, "List--" The other group gets ten positive features,
"smart, beautiful, kind… really nice… good cook… punctual, smart… No, I
mentioned that." The problem is nobody has ten positive features! And
the effect of being asked to do ten positive features is people find
this hard. And then those people, when asked, "How much do you like
this person?" say, "Couldn't really make it that ten. I guess I don't
like them very much."</p>

<p>Now, the point of this illustration, again, is that it shows that
you don't know this. Subjects who were asked to do ten positive
features and then later ranked the person lower and then asked, "Why
did you rank the person lower?" Don't say, "'Cause you told me to list
ten." Typically, we are oblivious to these factors that change our
points – what we like and what we dislike – and this is, in fact, a
substantial and an important part of the study of psychology, and
particularly, for instance, the study of racial and sexual prejudice.
Where--One of the big findings from social psychology, and we'll devote
almost an entire lecture to this, is that people have strong views
about other races that they don't know about and that they don't know
how to control their actions.</p>

<p>So, to some extent, this rounds out Freud because to some extent the
particulars of Freud are--for the most part have been rejected. But the
general idea of Freud's actually been so successful both in the study
of scientific psychology and in our interpretation of everyday life
that, to some extent, Freud's been a victim of his own success. We tend
to underestimate the importance of Freudian thought in everyday life
because he's transformed our world view to such an extent that it's
difficult for us to remember if there's any other way to think about
it. So, to some extent, he's been the victim of his own success.</p>

<p>We have time for some further questions about Freud and about
scientific implications of Freud. I took a class once on how to teach
when I was a graduate student. And I just remember two things from this
class. One thing is never grade in red pen. Those--People don't like
that. The second thing is never ask any questions, because presumably
it is very frightening to ask, "Any questions?" and people find it's
intimidating. I'm supposed to ask, "What are your questions?" So, what
are your questions? Yes, in back. Sorry.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Did Freud believe in [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: Did Freud believe in [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Medication</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: Medication. Freud had an--It's a good
question. The question was, "Does--did Freud believe in medication?"
Medication, of course, being a major theme of how we deal with certain
disorders now, particularly depression and anxiety disorders. On the
one hand, Freud made his start as a neuroscientist. Freud studied the
mind and the brain and was intensely interested in the neural basis of
thought and behavior. But the answer to your question in the end is,
"no." Although Freud was very sensitive to the brain basis of behavior,
Freud was totally convinced that the method through which to cure
disorders like depression and anxiety would not be medication but
rather through the sort of talk therapy and insight. Moreover, modern
therapists, including some people who aren't psychoanalytically
defined, will say, "Look. These drugs are all well and good but what
they do is they mask the symptoms." So, if you have panic attacks, say,
it's true that drugs might make the panic attacks go away, but the
panic attacks are actually not your real problem. And by making them go
away you don't get to the root of your problem. So, the answer is both
Freud and modern day psychoanalysts would think that medications are
substantially overused in the treatment of mental disorders. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Are there any [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: The question is, "What about research
on dreams?" "Dreams" is such a fun topic that I'm going to devote half
a class to sleeping and dreams. So, for instance, I will answer the
question "What is the most common dream?" I will also answer the
question "Who thinks about sex more in dreams, men or women, and what
proportion of--" Oh. There's so many great questions I will answer.
Dreams from a Freudian standpoint. There's been some evidence that
dreams do, and some often do, have some relationship to what you're
thinking about and worrying about through the day. But the strong
Freudian view about symbolism and wish fulfillment has not been
supported by the study of dreams. What are your other questions? Yes,
whoever Erik is pointing to.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: Purple shirt. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]--Electra complex?</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: The Electra complex? The Electra
complex is the penis envy story. Freud developed--This is a crude
summary, but Freud developed the Oedipal complex, "Mom, I love Mommy,
Dad." And then it's as if somebody reminded him, "Sigmund, there are
also women." "Oh, yeah." And that story I told you with the penises and
the penis envy and the replacement is sort of a very shortened version
of the Electra complex. I think it's fair to say that the Electra
complex was a sort of add-on to the main interest of Freud's Oedipal
complex. One more, please. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: According to Freud, the--there's not a
fixation in the stage, in the same sense as an oral or anal stage, but
yes. The claim that Freud would make is that the woman's discovery that
she lacks the penis plays a fundamental role later on determining her
allegiances in life and in fact her own sexual preferences and
interests. So, it's not the sort of thing that affects her just for a
short period.</p>
