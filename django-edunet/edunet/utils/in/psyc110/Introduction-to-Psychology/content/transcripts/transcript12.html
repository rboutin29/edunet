<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: So what we're doing today is continuing
on the theme of emotions. "Emotions" is a two-part lecture and we're
continuing along certain themes.</p>

<p>I want to begin by responding to a question which was raised in the
last class concerning smiling and nonhuman primates. It was a very good
question. The issue was: we know that humans have different sorts of
smiles to convey different sorts of information. The question was, "do
nonhuman primates, like chimpanzees or gorillas or gibbons, have the
same many sorts of smiles?" So, I contacted the world's expert on
smiling, who did not return my e-mails. So, I contacted the second
world's expert on smiling who told me that the answer is "no," that
primate--nonhuman primate smiles actually correspond almost entirely to
appeasement smiles. They're "don't hurt me" smiles. They're equivalent
to the "coy smile" that we saw on humans. But that nonhuman primates do
not use smiles for greetings; there's no equivalent to the "greeting
smile" or "Pan Am smile"; nor do they use them as genuine expressions
of happiness. There's no equivalent to the "Duchenne smile." That's as
far as I know. If the world's expert gets back to me and says something
different, I'll keep you posted.</p>

<p>Another thing. Going back to the beginning theme of the class, what
we started--just to review, we talked about the different functions of
emotions. And then we talked about smiling and facial expressions. And
then we turned to some--to a nonsocial emotion, the case of fear. And
then we shifted to social emotions. And we talked about social emotions
towards kin and the special evolutionary reasons that would lead them
to evolve. And as we were ending, we were talking about the
relationship between an animal and its children, particularly in cases
like humans and birds and mammals where there tends to be a close
relationship with our children.</p>

<p>We invest in quality, not quantity. I might produce very few
children in my life. And my evolutionary trick then is to focus very
intently on them and make sure they survive. If I were to produce 100
children, I could stand to lose a few, but if I just produce five in my
lifetime or two or one, they become very precious to me. And so, the
story of the evolution of a species like us involves a long period of
dependence and deep, deep bonds between the parent and the child. And
that's part of what I talked about, how parents respond to
children.</p>

<p>And I want to begin this class by giving an illustration from a
documentary about parental response to children, but I want to give it
in a species that's not us. And here is why. I'll explain why with an
analogy. I have a friend of mine who studies the psychology of
religion. He studies why people hold religious beliefs. And he tells me
that when he's talking to a non specialist, somebody not in the field,
he doesn't ever tell them, "Yeah, I'm really interested in why people
believe in the Bible or why people light the candles on Sabbath or why
people go to church" because these are religions that people around
here hold, and if you tell people you study them they'll sort of be
puzzled, "why would you want to study something like that" or offended.
If you want to talk about the psychology of religion to an audience
like this, what you do is you start with the exotic. So, you start by
talking about people who put butter on their heads.</p>

<p>Dan Sperber talks about a culture where the men put butter on their
heads in the summer. And it kind of melts and that's part of--one of
the things that they do or--you talk about a culture that believes in
spirits or that trees can talk. You say you're studying it and they
say, "Oh, that's interesting. I wonder why they believe that?" And you
use that as a way to look at more general facts that exist even in our
culture. You use the fact that we don't take the exotic for granted as
a way to motivate the scientific study of things we do take for
granted.</p>

<p>And this is, of course, true more generally. This was the point in
the William James quote when he talked about things that are natural to
us and noticed that some very odd things are equally natural to other
species. And it's true, I think, in particular when we talk about
things like the love we have for our children. So, one way to look at
the love we have for our children scientifically, isn't to look at it
head-on, because the love we feel towards our own children feels
sacred, it feels special, but look at it in other species. And so, one
of the nicest illustrations of this is the Emperor penguin, which
was--which--whose childcare and mating practices were dramatized in a
wonderful movie called "March of the Penguins." And this is interesting
because they had this incredibly elaborate and quite precarious system
of generating and taking care of offspring.</p>

<p>So, I want to show you a brief clip of the movie to illustrate some
parts of this. What they do at the beginning, which is not--which leads
up to this, is they take a very long trek from the water to their
breeding grounds. Their breeding grounds is--are protected from the
wind and they're on a firm piece of ice so they could hold the whole
pack. They do the breeding there and it's there that the eggs are
created. So, this is where the movie begins at this point. [clip
playing]</p>

<p>"March of the Penguins" was the second best--second most popular
documentary of all time, beaten only by "Fahrenheit 9/11." And people
responded to it in different ways, which are informative when we think
about the generalizations you could make from animal behavior to human
behavior. Some conservative commentators saw this as a celebration of
family values, such as love and trust and monogamy. Some liberals, who
hate everything that's good and true, [laughter] responded by saying,
"Well, yeah, they're monogamous for one breeding season. It's a year.
Then they go and find another mate. If you add it up, it's pretty
slutty." [laughter]</p>

<p>I think more to the point, people were impressed and stunned by the
rich and articulate and systematic behavior that these animals were
showing. Plainly, they didn't pick it up from television, movies,
culture, learning, schooling, and so on. To some extent, this sort of
complicated behavior came natural to them. And it's understandable that
some proponents of intelligent design, or creationism, pointed to this
as an example of how God creates things that are deeply, richly
intricate so as to perpetrate the survival of different animals. From a
Darwinian standpoint, the Darwinian would agree with the creationist
that this couldn't have happened by accident, this is just far too
complicated, but would appeal to the--to this as an exquisite example
of a biological adaptation, in particular a biological adaptation
regarding parental care to children shaped by the fact that children
share the parents' genes and so parents will evolve in ways that
perpetrate the survival of their children.</p>

<p>Then there's the other direction, which is how children respond to
parents, how the young ones are wired up to resonate and respond in
different ways to the adults around them. And we quickly talked about
some different theories of this. And I'll just review what we talked
about last class. Babies will develop an attachment to whoever is
closest. They'll usually prefer their mothers because their mothers are
typically those who are closest to them. They'll prefer her voice, her
face, her smell. It used to be thought that there is some sort of
magical moment of imprinting that when the baby is born, the baby must
see his or her mother and "boom," a connection is made. If the baby
doesn't, terrible things will happen with attachment later on. This is
silly. There is no reason to believe there's some special moment or
special five minutes or special hour. It's just in the fullness of time
babies will develop an attachment to the animal that's closest to it.
They will recognize it as, at an implicit level, at an unconscious
level, as their kin.</p>

<p>Well, how does this work? How does the baby's brain develop--come to
develop an emotional attachment to that creature? Well, you remember
from Skinner that operant conditioning could provide a good answer to
this. And this is known as the "Cupboard Theory," which is babies love
their moms because their moms provide food. It's the law of effect.
It's operant conditioning. They will approach their mothers to get the
food from them. And they will develop an attachment because their
mother provides food. And this is contrasted with a more nativist,
hard-wired theory developed by Bowlby which claims that there's two
things going on. There is a draw to mom for comfort and social
interaction and fear of strangers.</p>

<p>Now, in the real world, it's difficult to pull apart these two means
of attraction because the very same woman who's giving you comfort and
social interaction is also the one giving you milk. But in the
laboratory you can pull them apart. And that's what Henry Harlow did in
the movies you saw last week. So, Harlow exposed primates to two
different mothers. One is a wire mother. That's a Skinnerian mother.
That's a mother who gave food. The other is a cloth mother set-up so
that she'd be comfortable and give warmth and cuddling. And the
question is, "Which one do babies go for?" And as you can remember from
the movies, the results are fairly decisive. Babies go to the wire
mother to eat--as one of the characters said, "You've got to eat to
live." But they viewed the--they loved the cloth mother. They developed
an attachment to the warm, cuddly mother. That's the one they used as a
base when they were threatened. That's the one they used as a base from
which to explore.</p>

<p>Okay. And that actually--Oh, that's just--I have a picture. And that
actually takes me to the--Oh, except for one thing, it almost takes me
to the end of the question of our emotions towards kin. One question
you could ask is, "What if there's no contact at all?" Now, you could
imagine the effects of how--A lot of people are interested in the
question of the effects of the child's early relationship to adults
around him or her in how the child turns out later. This becomes hugely
relevant for social debates like daycare. So for instance, a lot of
psychologists are interested in the question, "Is it better for a child
to be raised by a parent, usually a mother, or does it make a
difference if the child goes to daycare? What if the child goes to
daycare at six months? What if the child goes to daycare at two years?
How does this affect the child?" The short answer is, nobody really
knows. There's a lot of debate over whether or not there are subtle
differences and it's deeply controversial. But we do know that it
doesn't make a big difference. We do know that if you got raised by
mom, or perhaps mom and dad, or maybe just dad all through your life
until going off for school and I--my parents threw me in a daycare at
age three months--it's not going to make a big difference for us, maybe
a subtle difference though it's not clear which way it would go. But it
won't make a big difference.</p>

<p>But what if there's no contact at all? What if--What about terrible
circumstances where people get no cloth mother, they get nobody for
attachment? This is a really--In the real world, of course, you can't
do experiments on this. And in the real world with humans, this only
happens in tragic cases. But this has been studied. So Harlow, again,
raised monkeys in solitary confinement so they were raised in steel
cages with only a wire mother. In other words, they got all the
nutrition they needed but they got no mothering. It turned out that you
kind of get monkey psychotics. They're withdrawn. They don't play. They
bite themselves. They're incompetent sexually. They're incompetent
socially. They're incompetent maternally. In one case, one of these
monkeys raised in solitary confinement was artificially inseminated.
When she had a child she banged its head on the floor and then bit it
to death. So, you need to be--you need--This shows--This is kind of a
stark demonstration that some early connection, some early attachment
is critical for the developing of a primate.</p>

<p>Obviously, you don't do these experiments with people but there are
natural experiments, humans raised in harsh orphanages with little
social contact, and these children--If the--In other words, they get
fed, barely, but nobody picks them up and cuddles them. These children,
if this happens for long enough, they end up with severe problems with
social and emotional development. From an emotional point of view,
they're often insatiable. They really need cuddling and support or
they're apathetic, they don't care at all. Now, there's some sort of
good news, which is if you get these people or these monkeys early
enough you can reverse the effects of this bad development. So, there's
some research done with monkey therapists. So then, what they do is
they take the monkey, they raise it in a steel cage, the monkey comes
out, the monkey is kind of psycho, and then they send in a younger
monkey who is just goofing around, jumping all around the place and
everything. And experience with this younger monkey who just follows
them around and clings to them leads to gradual improvement. It makes
the solitary monkey become better.</p>

<p>There might be a similar effect with humans. So one story more
about--of an anecdote than an experiment was a situation where at the
age of one and a half, children were taken away from a really harsh
orphanage where they had no contact and brought into a home for
mentally retarded women where these women gave them plenty of contact
and cuddling and apparently, from what we know, brought them back to
normal. And this is all I want to talk about, about the emotions we
feel towards our kin, towards our children, and towards our parents.
Any questions or thoughts? Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Do children in orphanages comfort each other?</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> It's a good question. Do children in
orphanages comfort each other? I don't know. The situation probably
wouldn't be there--The problem is children in orphanages who are in
these terrible situations tend to be babies and very young and they
wouldn't be thrown together in situations where they could comfort each
other. It's a really interesting question. What if it was a situation
where children were raised without a supportive cloth mother at all,
would not be able to pick them up and hold them, but they could play
amongst themselves and support each other? I don't know the answer to
that.</p>

<p><b>Teaching Assistant:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Yes? Is there evidence on that?</p>

<p><b>Teaching Assistant:</b> Yes, there is. [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Yes. [laughter] The answer is there is
evidence, [laughs] as everybody knows, [laughter] that this sort
of--amongst the young, support can actually help the monkey and the
children. Somebody else had a question here? Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What does that tell us about the middle ground, if
the parent is comforting just a little bit and then not that much
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Right. So this is--The question is,
"What does that tell us about the middle ground?" So this is an extreme
case but what do we know about the middle case? Say your parent--You're
not raised in a cage, you're not in a Romanian orphanage, but your
parents just don't pick you up very much. They don't love you very
much. There's no good evidence that that has any effect on a person.
The problem is, and we're going to talk about this in much more detail
in a couple of weeks, is it's true that parents who aren't affectionate
have kids that aren't affectionate but it's not clear this is because
of a genetic connection or an environmental connection. The one thing
we do know is that in the middle ground, effects tend not to be
dramatic. So when you get away from extreme cases, effects are hard to
see and require careful experimental research to tease out. I think
what it's safe to say for a lot--for everything but the severe
conditions is we don't know what kind of effects there are. But if
there are effects they are not big and dramatic ones.</p>

<p>Okay. Animals' good feelings, animals' emotional attraction to their
kin, is not a huge puzzle from an evolutionary point of view. Evolution
is driven by forces that operate on the fact of how many genes get
reproduced and replicated among your descendants. So, it makes sense
that animals would be wired-up to care for their kids. It would make
sense that kids who are wired-up to survive would develop attachments
to their parents. What's more of a puzzle though is that animals,
including humans, seem to have exquisitely complicated relationships
with non-kin. In particular, animals are nice to non-kin. You are nice
to people that you're not related to. There are a lot of examples of
this. Animals groom one another. You go, you pick off the lice and the
bugs off your friend; they pick it off you. They give warning
cries.</p>

<p>So, warning cries--All sorts of animals give warning cries. You
are--I don't know. You're a little animal and a big animal comes
charging and you say, "Hey!" Oh. You may sort of cry and everybody runs
away. And that's very risky for you but you do it anyway, often to
protect people you aren't related to. Often animals share childcare.
And from a cold-blooded, natural selection, survival-of-the-gene point
of view, you would imagine that if you lend me your kid for the day I
would eat him for the protein and "it's not my genes and actually it
gives more for my kids." That's not quite how it works though.</p>

<p>Animals share food. In fact, that animal, hugely ugly, the vampire
bat, shares food. What happens is the vampire bat--vampire bats live in
caves and they fly out. And what they do is often a bat will strike it
big. She'll find a horse, for instance, bite the horse, pump in tons of
blood and then fly back. And what it does is it doesn't keep it to
itself. Rather, it goes around the whole cave and vomits blood into the
mouth of all the other vampire bats so everybody benefits. Isn't that
nice? [laughter] Now, what you're tempted to say is, "Well, that's
really nice. Everybody benefits," but this raises a puzzle from the
evolutionary point of view.</p>

<p>Remember, animals benefit more, and to this situation, animals
benefit more by working together than by working alone. The benefits
outweigh the costs. This is known as "reciprocal altruism" meaning my
behavior to you, my good behavior to you, my altruism for you, is
predicated on the idea of reciprocation, "I'll benefit from you." And
you imagine how vampire bats, for instance, why this makes sense. This
is--If you're a vampire bat, it's a better system when anybody strikes
it big to feed you rather than for anybody who strike it big, use the
blood and then spit out all the rest of it. But here's the problem.
Here's why it's such a puzzle. The problem is the existence of
cheaters. And in economics and sociology these are also known as
"free-riders." And what a cheater or free-rider does is it takes the
benefits without paying the cost. Imagine two genes. Imagine one builds
a vampire bat that accepts blood from others and shares blood. The
other gene accepts blood from others and doesn't share blood. In the
long run, "B" will actually out-produce gene "A" because in fact, "B"
will be healthy while other vampire bats get sick. And then so the
offspring will do better.</p>

<p>An even sharper example is an example of warning cries. So, gophers
give warning cries when there's a predator. It is extremely adaptive to
give a warning cry. Sorry. It's extremely adaptive to respond to a
warning cry. You hear a warning cry, you-- "Oh, crap," you run away. It
is not very adaptive to give a warning cry. A really good solution then
is to listen to warning cries but not to give them. Suppose we had a
system--It is very adaptive when people are going to the bar, when
people buy drinks to accept the drinks. It is not so adaptive, from the
standpoint of one's wallet, to buy people drinks. Here is a solution.
Accept drinks but don't pay for drinks. And if everybody fell to that
solution, the idea of buying a round would fade. So, there is the
puzzle. Since cheating--Since a cheater, in the short run, can always
out-win--does better than a non-cheater, how could this cooperation
evolve? How could it be an evolutionarily stable strategy?</p>

<p>And the answer is "cheater detection." Reciprocal altruism can only
evolve if animals are wired up to punish cheaters. Now, that requires a
lot of mental apparatus. You have to recognize cheaters, you have to
remember cheaters, and you have to be motivated to punish cheaters. And
not every animal has this degree of complicated apparatus but actually
we know that vampire bats do. So, in one clever study--So the theory
says--the evolutionary theory says "yeah, I see what these vampire bats
are doing," but you see--and this is a case where evolution makes a
nice prediction that couldn't evolve unless bats are keeping track. If
bats aren't keeping track, then the system could never exist because
the cheaters would just take it over. They must be watching for
cheaters.</p>

<p>So, the experiment which was done is you--a vampire bat strikes it
big, it flies back, and then you keep it--as a scientist you keep it
from giving blood to anybody else. Then what happens? Well, what
happens is when the other bats strike it big they starve the selfish
bat, just as if we go to bars and everybody buys a round except for me.
And this happens over and over and over again. Pretty soon you're going
to buy a round but you're not going to give me one. And so, just as
humans are keeping their eyes out for people who are taking the
benefits without paying the costs, so are other animals. And it is
argued that this sensitivity to cheating, this focus on reciprocation,
plays a powerful role in the evolution of social behavior and the
evolution of social emotions.</p>

<p>And a classic illustration of this is The Prisoner's Dilemma. Now,
many of you, I think, have seen The Prisoner's Dilemma in one course or
another? It shows up--It is one of the main constructs in the social
sciences. It shows up in cognitive science, psychology, economics, that
you could--The teaching fellows are passing around something which
you're not going to use right away. But for some of you this is the
first time you're going to be exposed to The Prisoner's Dilemma so let
me spell it out.</p>

<p>Here's the idea. You and a friend commit a crime. You rob a bank,
for instance. For the sake of this example, you are prisoner two. You
get caught. The police put you in a little room and they say, "We want
to know everything that happened. In particular, we want you to rat out
your friend." Now, here are the options, and one thing about this is
nothing is hidden. The police officer could actually print out a copy
of The Prisoner's Dilemma and put it right in front of you. And what he
could say is, "Look." You're prisoner two. "You could cooperate--Well,
you have two options. You could either cooperate with your friend, you
could stay silent, or you could defect or you could squeal." But the
police officer says, "Look. If you--Let me tell you something. If you
cooperate with your friend and he squeals on you, you'll go to prison
for life and he'll walk out. However, if you squeal on him and he
cooperates, he keeps quiet, he'll go to prison for life and you'll walk
out." So, what do you do? Now, on the nice side, what you can do is you
could say, "No. I'm going to be quiet. I'm going to cooperate." Now, if
you could trust your friend to cooperate, you're fine, you each get a
little stint in prison, but of course your friend might defect. Your
friend might squeal.</p>

<p>Here is the important structure of The Prisoner's Dilemma. No matter
what you--what your friend chooses to do, you're better off squealing.
So, suppose you're prisoner two. You believe your friend's going to
cooperate with you. He's not going to be--he's not going to give the
information out. Well, then your best thing to do is squeal on him.
What if you believe he's going to squeal on you? Well, your best thing
to do is squeal on him but if you could get your act together and you
could coordinate this, you would both be quiet and get a fairly minor
penalty. And you could see this--This is the standard origin of the
prisoner's dilemma, why it's called "The Prisoner's Dilemma," but you
could see this all over the place. So, here is the logic. The best case
for you is to defect while the other person cooperates. The worst case
is to cooperate while the other person defects.</p>

<p>Back to the police thing. The best case for you is to give up all
the information; the other guy stays silent; you cut a deal; you walk
home that day. The worst case is you're quiet, he cuts a deal, you go
to prison for life, but overall the best is that each cooperate and
overall the worst for both is if each defect. And the reason that makes
this tragic is this. Regardless of what your opponent does, it pays to
defect, but if both people defect both are worse off. I'll give a
couple of other examples. No. [referring to a slide] That's just to
show that there's a cartoon corresponding to The Prisoner's Dilemma. It
is that common.</p>

<p>Here's the idea. I am--I break up with my wife. We've been married
for a while. We've decided we're not going to go through it together
anymore and we break up. We're living in separate houses and we're
starting to talk divorce. It occurs to me--Here's me. I put that out
there. "Should I get a divorce lawyer?" I ask. Now, I know divorce
lawyers are really expensive. And it's kind of difficult to get a
divorce lawyer. But if I get a divorce lawyer--And so neither one of us
get a divorce lawyer we'll just do okay. We'll get a mediator. We'll
split the money down the middle. That'll be okay but I'm kind of
tempted. If I get a divorce lawyer and she doesn't, my divorce lawyer
will take everything she's got. I get everything, she loses everything.
Maybe I should be nice. Hold it. What if she gets a divorce lawyer and
I don't? Well, then I'll lose everything, she'll get everything. Well,
we should both get a divorce lawyer then but we'd both do pretty
badly.</p>

<p>Imagine we're two countries, country "A" and country "B." Should I
do nuclear disarmament? That's pretty good. We'd do okay if both
countries disarmed. We would live our lives; we'll raise taxes; we'll
do whatever countries do. But wouldn't it be cool if I build up my
weaponry and they don't? I'll invade, take everything they got. That's
kind of tempting. Uh oh. Also, if I don't do anything and they do it,
they'll invade my country, take everything. So, we both build up our
weaponry and we both do pretty badly. Once you start thinking about
things this way, there's no end to the sort of notions that could fall
under The Prisoner's Dilemma.</p>

<p>A good example is a drug deal. Suppose I want to buy marijuana from
you, or "reefer" as they call it on the street. [laughter] So, I have
$1,000 and from you I'd like to buy a ton of reefer so--I'm rounding
off. [laughter] So, you say, "Wonderful. Wonderful. Let's meet behind
the gym, two in the morning on Friday, and we'll do the exchange. You
bring $1,000, I bring the reefer." "Oh, cool. Okay. Good." And I think,
"that's pretty good, a thousand bucks, I get the reefer, you get a
thousand bucks. That's okay, that's the normal thing." But now
something occurs to me. "Nobody's going to go to the cops if things go
badly. So instead of doing--bringing the money, why don't I just bring
a gun? You come with your reefer, I stick a gun in your face, take the
reefer, go home."</p>

<p>Maybe I won't do that, but now I worry because you're thinking the
same thing. So, you could show up with a gun, stick the gun in my face,
take the thousand bucks, go home. I'll have no reefer. What will I
smoke? [laughter] So, we both think this way. So, we both show up
behind the gym, two in the morning, with guns. [laughter] Well, that's
not as bad for either one of us if I had--I--you had a gun and I didn't
have a gun. But still, we're both worse off than if we could cooperate
and just do the damn trade. And so that's the structure of The
Prisoner's Dilemma.</p>

<p>You can only appreciate The Prisoner's Dilemma by actually doing it.
So, here's--here is a numerical equivalent to The Prisoner's Dilemma.
Everybody should have a card in front of you, a file card. If you
don't--If you didn't get a card, a piece of paper will do just as well.
Please write on one side "cooperate" and on the other side "defect" and
then please find a partner with whom to play one game. This is a
one-shot game. One of you is player one. The player on the right-most
side from my right could be player one. The other one is player two. Do
you each have a partner? If you have three people, you could cluster
together and do two and then two and just think. It is actually best if
you've never met or spoken to the person you're about to deal with. And
the game is, when I say "go," simply show the person your choice.</p>

<p>To be clear, if you are player one and you cooperate and player two
cooperates as well, you each get three dollars. If you are player one
and you cooperate while player two defects, player two gets five
dollars and you get bupkis and so on. On three, just show the card to
your opponent, to your person you're playing with. One, two, three.
[laughter] Okay. How many people in this room cooperated? How many
cooperated? How many defected? [laughter] Okay. How many people are now
five dollars richer? Okay. How many of you got nothing? [laughter]
Okay. So, you're learning. You're learning that the person next to you
is really an SOB. [laughter] Now, find the person next to you and you
get to play again. And you get to play five games in a row. Play five
games in a row and keep score. You just show it to each other, record
the numbers, show it, show it, show it, show it. Go now. [laughter]
Anybody here win twenty-five dollars? Yes, twenty-five? So you--</p>

<p><b>Student 1:</b> He cooperated four times and I defected--</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> That's twenty, twenty-one. [laughter]
Okay. That's good. That's good. So, it really is a measure of honesty.
[laughs] Anybody win twenty or more? Fifteen or more. Fourteen or less.
Anybody do five or less? You're a good person. It's good. It's good.
You played it with him?</p>

<p><b>Student 2:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Bad person. [laughter] It's not really
about good or bad. There was a great game once. It's a simple game, but
it was a great game, a great, famous competition a long time ago, about
20 years ago, set up by the great computer scientist Robert Axelrod.
And he put together a competition where people brought in computer
programs to play this game, to play The Prisoner's Dilemma. And there
were sixty-three competitors. And these computer programs were
incredibly--Some of them were very simple, always be nice, always
be--always cooperate, always defect. Some were elegant, prime number
solutions and prototype responses, genetic algorithms crafted to figure
out what the other person was doing and suss them out.</p>

<p>But the winner was developed by Anatol Rappaport. And Anatol
Rappaport actually died about a month ago at quite an old age, a great
scientist. What was interesting about this was he was the winner with
his program but his program was also one of the simplest. It may well
have been the simplest. It was called "Tit-for-Tat" and it worked very
simple. It took four lines of basic code. The first time you meet a new
program, cooperate. The first time you meet somebody, be nice. After
that, do on each trial what the other program did on the previous
trial. This beat sixty-two others.</p>

<p>And here is why. It had certain beautiful features. It starts
friendly. Remember the best long-term solution is everybody's
be--everybody's nice. It starts off nice but you can't--it's not a
sucker. If you screw with it, it will defect back on the next turn. It
is, however, forgiving. Do you want to get nice with it? Be nice. If
you're nice, it'll be nice back at you later on. It's also transparent,
nothing complicated about it, and that's actually important. It's not
merely that it's not a sucker and forgiving. More to the point, it
is--you could tell it's not a sucker. And you could tell it's
forgiving. And this very powerful algorithm learned to cooperate even
in the situation--and helped--learned to make it out the best even in a
situation where there's a risk of cheating and betrayal.</p>

<p>Some psychologists have argued that our emotions correspond to the
different permutations on The Prisoner's Dilemma. We like people who
cooperate with us. This motivates us to be nice to them in the future
much as the Tit-for-Tat algorithm says, "If you are nice to me now,
I'll be nice to you back." We don't like being screwed with. We feel
anger and distrust towards those who betray us. That motivates us to
betray or avoid them in the future. And we feel bad when we betray
somebody who cooperates with us. This motivates us to behave better in
the future. You can break down the cells of The Prisoner's Dilemma in
terms of emotions that they give rise to.</p>

<p>I did an experiment last night with my seven-year-old and my
ten-year-old. I explained to them The Prisoner's Dilemma. I didn't give
the divorce lawyer example but-- [laughter] and we gave them a big
thing of chocolate chips and--the good chocolate chips. We had the good
chips and we had the matrix and we had them play. Now, what they did
isn't so interesting, but what's interesting is they were furious at
each other. One of them, the younger boy, was--kept being betrayed by
the older boy including tricks like he'd say, "Okay. Let's both
cooperate." "Yeah. Okay." Then he'd cooperate-- "defect!" And
[laughter] the response was anger, though not actually guilt on the
part of the other boy [laughter] but rage. And we see these sort of
things all the time in real life.</p>

<p>You're familiar with The Prisoner's Dilemma but there's another
game, which you might not be familiar with. It's called The Ultimatum
Game. How many of you have encountered The Ultimatum Game? Okay, some
of you. Very simple. Choose a partner. It's a very simple game. When
economists study this they actually do this with real money. I do not
have real money to let you do this too. One of you is "A," one of you
is "B." The one on the right most from this side is "A." The other one
is "B." Here is a very simple rule. I'd like "A" to turn to "B" and
make an offer. "A" has ten dollars. You can give "B" any amount you
choose from that ten dollars, from one dollar to ten dollars. "B" can
do only one thing. "B" can accept it; if you accept it, you agree to
take home the money and "A" keeps what ever's left--or reject it. If
you reject it, you get nothing. Nobody gets anything.</p>

<p>Is everybody clear? So "A" is going to say, "I'll give you so and so
dollars." "B" would say, "Okay," in which case "B" walks away with so
and so dollars or--and "A" walks away with whatever rest or "B" could
say, "Reject," in which case nobody gets anything. So, this game comes
in two steps. The first thing: I would like "A" to turn to "B" and make
your offer. Don't--"B" doesn't do anything yet. Make your offer. Your
offer should be one word. People are explaining their offer. Make your
offer. Okay. Stage two. Do not negotiate. [laughter] You're not--I see
people waving their hands and it's complicated. It should be a number
from one to ten, a positive integer. Now, "B" --I would like "B" to say
one word and you can say it really loud on three. Accept or reject.
One, two, three. [laughter]</p>

<p>Wow. How many people accepted? Anybody reject it? Good. Okay. How
many people offered ten dollars? [laughter] How many people offered
more than five dollars? Okay. How many people offered one dollar? Okay.
When you offered one dollar did you accept? Anybody else offer one
dollar? When you offered one dollar did your partner accept? Okay. How
many people offered either four or five dollars? Okay. This is an
interesting game because the person who offered--who accepted one
dollar was being rational. One dollar is better than no dollars. So,
the psychology of human rationality is such that, from a logical point
of view, you should reason one dollar is better than nothing. A
rational person should accept one dollar. And because we're smart,
a--you should offer one dollar but not many of you offered one dollar.
Why? Because you knew people are not purely rational. People, even in a
one-shot game, won't accept unfair distributions. They'll reject them
just out of spite. And so, you need to offer more. And this has been
studied from a neuro-economic point of view, which basically provides
neuroanatomical evidence that people--if you offered them one dollar
they get really pissed. [laughter] Nobody likes to be offered a
dollar.</p>

<p>Now, there's a more general moral here, which is actually an
interesting surprise of some relevance to everyday life. A rational
person is easily exploited. A rational person's responses to
provocations, to assaults will always be measured inappropriate. If you
know I'm rational and you're in a sharing situation with me, you could
say to me, "Hey. Here's a dollar. Hey, Mr. Rational, a dollar's better
than nothing." "Well, okay," because I'm rational. Similarly, you could
mess with me because you could harass me in all sorts of ways, take
things that I own, as long as you reason that a rational person
wouldn't start a fuss about this.</p>

<p>There is some advantage to being irrational, to having a temper.
Because if you have a temper and you're known to be irrational, people
are forced, by dint of your irrationality, to treat you better. Who am
I going to take from? The person who's extremely reasonable or the
person who has a hair-trigger temper? Well, I'm going to pick on a
reasonable person because the unreasonable person might do unreasonable
things. And this is faintly paradoxical, but often to be irrational, or
at least to have a reputation for mild irrationality, gives you an
edge.</p>

<p>Now, this isn't focus of provocation but this has also been
presented in the theory of why people fall in love. Suppose you're
choosing who to devote your life to, and it's a matter of huge trust.
We're going to raise kids together. It's very important for you that I
don't leave. And I am very rational so I say to you, "We should mate
and have children because I find you the most attractive of everybody
who was available that I've met so far. I'm very rational and so long
as this continues to be the case we'll be together." Well, that's
reasonable and rational but wouldn't you rather be with somebody who's
head over heels in love? Head over heels in love is irrational but it's
also, within certain parameters, endearing because the irrationality of
the person means you could trust them more in the long run, just like
the irrationality of somebody who has a temper means you don't mess
with them as much.</p>

<p>The studies have been done more with regard to violence than with
love. And in fact, the irrationality--the benefits of irrational
violence have been translated in terms of the study of homicide and
other crimes. Daly and Wilson describe the cause of murder. Most murder
is not caused by reasonable provocation. Most murder is not rational in
its response. Most murder is generated by insult, curse, petty
infraction, but this is not crazy irrationality. It's adaptive
irrationality. Daly and Wilson point out, "in chronically feuding and
warring societies an essential manual--manly virtue is the capacity for
violence. To turn the other cheek is not saintly, but stupid or
contemptibly weak." If I show myself a rational person when picked on
or harassed, I'll be known as somebody you could pick on and
harass.</p>

<p>And in fact, it turns out even in the modern world--This is from a
<i>New York Times</i> I just picked up a year ago today. And the point
is that the violence is due to people disrespecting each other or
giving a dirty look. And you might think "isn't that irrational?" But
it's not irrational in circumstances where people live together in an
environment where they have to deal with each other over and over
again, and often where there's not much support by the police as
indications they talked about here. What's particularly interesting is
this sort of importance of a reputation for violence differs from
culture to culture. And I've been talking so far in this class--and in
fact, so far in this course--about universals, about things that are
built in, things that show up across humans and other animals. I want
to turn now and end this lecture by talking a little bit about a
cultural difference. And it's a psychologically interesting cultural
difference with regard to the emotions. And it's built around the
difference turning around what sociologists call "cultures of
honor."</p>

<p>A culture of honor has certain properties. You can't rely on the
law. And it has resources that are easily taken. And sociologists have
argued that when those conditions are met it becomes important to
develop a reputation for violent retaliation. That becomes important.
Examples of culture of honors include Scottish highlanders, Masai
warriors, Bedouin tradesmen, and Western cowboys – all cases where
there's resources such as cattle that are vulnerable and easily taken,
but you can't count on calling 911 and having people come help you. But
the culture of honor that's been studied the most by modern
psychologists is the American South.</p>

<p>This was settled by herdsmen and traditionally has less centralized
legal control. So, the sociologists say the American South has more of
a culture of honor than the American North. But how do you know? What
does that do? We're interested in this class in claims about
psychology. So, it took Richard Nisbett and Dov Cohen to study cultures
of honors and look at differences. And they found some interesting
differences. Gun laws tend to be more permissive in the southern--in
the American South than the American North. Corporal punishment and
capital punishment tend to be more approved of. Attitudes towards the
military are more positive. In questionnaire studies, people are more
forgiving towards cultures of honor. Somebody insults my woman and I
punch him in the face. This is considered less bad in the American
South than the American North. There's a higher rate of violence but
only in certain circumstances. The streets of the American South as a
rule are not more dangerous than the American North. The difference is
there's a higher rate of crimes that are crimes of honor such as, for
instance, if somebody breaks in to my house, me shooting him. Or if
somebody insults me, me killing him.</p>

<p>Now, this is sort of survey studies. So, Nisbett and Cohen did one
of the more interesting psychological studies I have ever heard of. And
they did this at--This--Sorry. This is Nisbett and Wilson. They did
this with University of Michigan undergraduates. They did a subject
pool thing like you're doing now, and on it your demographic
information was listed. And what they did was they took white males who
are not Hispanic and not Jewish. That was their sample. Culture of
honor is a phenomena limited to males and they wanted to make it sort
of a clean study so they wanted to focus--get a homogenous sample. So,
not Hispanic, not Jewish. And they provoked them. And the provocation
was genius.</p>

<p>What they did was they said--they brought people in to the
psychology building, as you'd be brought in to Kirtland or SSS or
Dunham [psychology buildings at Yale] and they said--they had somebody
go in to the desk and they said, "Yeah. Go down the hall for the
experiment." There was a hallway and then you walked through the
hallway. And walking in the other direction at that moment a graduate
student--a male graduate student would start to walk. And he's holding
some files. And what he does is he bumps the person, looks at him and
says, "Asshole" [laughter] and keep walking. Now, to be fair, the
graduate student survived bumping into hundreds of males, calling them
assholes and then walking to--Fights did not break out, nobody was
shot. But then they brought the men--now went in to a room and they
were tested. And it turned out that there were differences in the
stress response.</p>

<p>On average, males from the American South showed higher hormone
response and stress response than males in the American
North--increases in testosterone and cortisol. There's always
differences in later behavior, the people--suggesting that they were
made angry. They gave differences in fill-in-the-blank questions, for
instance. I don't remember the examples but it's examples like "John
went to the store and bought a 'blank'" and then the northerners would
say "and buy an apple." And the southerners would say "an AK-47
[laughter] to kill that freaking graduate student." [laughter] Now,
again, the American South--people in the American South were not
overall more violent than the American North, but they were more
sensitive to provocations of honor.</p>

<p>Now, when I gave this lecture a few years ago, a southern student
contacted me afterwards and said that she felt that picking out the
southern minority at Yale was in some regard offensive and that people
say things at Yale about southerners--American southerners that they
would never say about any other minority group. So, there's two points
I want to make regarding this. One is, of course, these are average
differences. Not every northerner and southerner would differ along
these lines. But another one is I think the effect is real, but it's
not entirely clear that it reflects poorly on the cultures of honor as
opposed to the other cultures. So, Nisbett, for instance, is himself a
southerner and he points out that he went to the North he was most
astonished by how rude people are. And this is because the North--the
American North is not particularly a culture of honor, and so there's
less proper behavior towards other people because there's no fear of
retaliation or response. Moreover, the culture of honor virtues like
honor, loyalty, courage and self-reliance, are on the face of it not
necessarily bad things.</p>

<p>In any case, this is an interesting example of how there's an
evolutionary background but culture modifies and shifts it in different
ways. More generally, I've suggested over the last couple of lectures
that emotions like fear, the love you have towards your children,
anger, gratitude are not aberrations or noise in the system. Rather,
they're exquisitely complicated motivational systems that are crafted
to deal with the natural and social environment. And we know this only
from an analysis that starts from an evolutionary approach. So, to
bring us back to D'Arcy Thompson, "everything is the way it is because
it got that way." And your reading response for this week is that.
[referring to a slide] And I'll wish you good luck on the exam on
Wednesday. And I'll see you there.</p>
