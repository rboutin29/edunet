<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: Just to review, here's where we left
off. The discussion from last lecture and for about half of this
lecture is going to be social psychology. And so, we started off by
talking about certain fundamental biases in how we see ourselves. We
then turned to talk about a bias and how we see other people, the
fundamental attribution error. And now we're talking a little bit about
some aspects of how we see other people. So, we quickly talked about
certain aspects of why we like other people including proximity,
similarity, and attractiveness, and where we left off was a discussion
of the Matthew effect, which is basically that good things tend to
compound. If you're rich you'll get a better education, if you're smart
people will like you more, if you're attractive and so on. Nobody bring
up their papers at this point. They'll collect them at the end of
class. What I want to talk to-- [laughter] Okay, except for you. Just
hand me it now. [laughter] I'm going to ask the teaching fellows to
stop anybody from approaching that area.</p>

<p>I want to begin by talking about [laughter] impression formation,
how we form impressions of others, and tell you a couple of interesting
things about impression formation. The first one is, first impressions
matter a lot. They matter a lot for different reasons. They might
matter a lot because humans have, in general, a confirmation bias such
that once you believe something other information is then encoded along
the likes to support what you believe. So, the classic study here was
done by Kelley where a guest speaker comes in and some of the students
received a bio describing the speaker as very warm, the other as--do
not bring your paper up if you're coming in late. Just--at the end of
class, yeah. [laughter] Others got a bio saying--thanks, Erik--the
speaker was rather cold and then it turned out later on [laughter] when
they're asked for their impressions of the speaker people are very much
biased by what they first assumed. If I'm described to you as a
vivacious and creative person and you see me and I'm all kind of
bouncing around and everything, you could then confirm this as, "Look
how vivacious and creative he is." If I'm described as somebody who
drinks too much, you might think he's an alcoholic. If he's described
as somebody who's insecure and nervous, you could interpret my activity
as nervous twitches. Your first impression sets a framework from which
you interpret everything else.</p>

<p>This was the theme of an excellent movie called <em>Being There</em>
starring Peter Sellers. And the running joke of the movie "Being There"
was that the main character, the character Chauncey Gardner, somehow
through accident had the reputation for being a genius but while, in
reality, he was actually mildly retarded. But he would go around and
people would ask him his opinions on politics and he would say things
like "Well, I like being in the garden." And because of his reputation
as a genius people said, "Wow. That's very profound. I wonder what he
means." And--or people would talk to him and he'd just stare at them
and say--and people would say--would be intimidated by his bold and
impetuous stare when actually he just totally didn't know anything. So,
first impressions can shape subsequent impressions not just when
dealing with people.</p>

<p>A little while ago there was a sniper, actually a pair of snipers
killing people in Washington and the one thing everybody knew about it
was there was a white van involved. It turned out there was no white
van at all but in the first incident somebody saw a white van, this was
reported in all the newspapers, then every other incident people
started seeing the white van. So, they started looking for them and
they started to attending--attend to them. So, first impressions matter
hugely when dealing with people because it sets the stage for how we
interpret everything else.</p>

<p>A second finding building on the first is that we form impressions
very fast, very quickly, and this is a literature known as "thin
slices." The idea is you don't have to see much of a person to get an
impression of what they are. The first studies done on this were
actually done on teachers, on university professors. So, university
professors have teaching evaluations and you could use this as a rough
and ready approximation of what students think of them. So, what you do
then is--the question that these people were interested in, Rosenthal
and Ambady, two social psychologists, were how long do you have to look
at a professor to guess how popular a teacher he is? So, they showed
these clips for a full class. Do you have to see them for a full class?
Do you have to see them for two classes? Do you have to see them for a
half hour? How long do you have to be around a person to see him, to
estimate how good a lecturer that person is? And the answer is five
seconds. So, after clips of five seconds people are pretty good at
predicting what sort of evaluations that person will have.</p>

<p>Remember "The Big Five," how we evaluate people on "The Big Five?"
Well, you have a roommate and your roommate you could evaluate on "The
Big Five." You've had a lot of experience with him or her. How much
time do you need to evaluate somebody on the five dimensions of
personality? The answer is, again, not much time at all. After very
brief exposures to people, people are very accurate at identifying them
on "The Big Five." One of the more surprising findings is--concerns
sexual orientation or "gaydar." That's not a scientific term [laughter]
but the same psychologists were interested in studying how quickly you
can--if at all how long does it take to figure out somebody's sexual
orientation?</p>

<p>Now, what they did was--they were clever psychologists so they set
it up in a study where the people did not know sexual orientation was
at issue. So, for instance, they may be people like you who filled in a
form, one question along a very long form was your sexual orientation,
and then you're sitting down being interviewed by somebody and your
interview is being filmed, and then other people are shown--who don't
know you are shown the film. And the finding is that people based on
thin slices are quite good at detecting sexual orientation. Everybody's
good at it, gay people are better at it than straight people, and,
again, you don't need much time. You just need about a second. You see
somebody for about a second, you could make a guess. You're far from
always right. In fact, you're just a bit better than chance but you are
better than chance at telling sexual orientation. So, these two facts
taken together, thin slices and the power of first impressions, means
that just by a brief exposure to somebody it shapes so much of how
you're going to think about them in the future.</p>

<p>Now, we can look at this from the other direction. We're talking
about the perceptions of other people, how we perceive other people,
but social psychologists are also interested in the question of what
happens to other people as a result of being perceived in a certain
way. So, one question is, "What would cause me to perceive somebody as
intelligent or stupid, gay or straight, anxious or level-headed?" A
second question is, "What are the effects of being judged that way?"
And psychologists have coined a term, talk about self-fulfilling
prophesies, and the claim here more specifically is what's known as
"the Pygmalion effect." And the Pygmalion effect is if I believe you
have a certain characteristic this might cause you to behave as if you
have that characteristic.</p>

<p>The name comes from the play by George Bernard Shaw
<em>Pygmalion</em>, and the quote here is "The difference between a
lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves but how she's treated. I
shall always be a flower girl to Professor Higgins because he always
treats me as a flower girl and always will," made into a better known
movie, <em>My Fair Lady</em>. But I think that the same theme is better
exemplified in a far better movie, <em>La Femme Nikita</em>, where a
cold-blooded killer is treated with respect and affection and then she
becomes a much more warm and accessible person, and then she kills a
lot of people but that--[laughter] but still it illustrates the
point.</p>

<p>And this point has tons of empirical validity. The classic
experiment was by Rosenthal and Jackson where they told teachers that
some of their kids were really smart and other kids were less--were not
really smart, they weren't expected to show a huge jump or spurt in
their IQ, and this was of course trickery. The children were chosen at
random but the children who were described as showing--as expected to
show a jump in IQ, in fact, did show a jump in their IQ scores and this
isn't magic. It's basically--if I am told that you're a genius and your
genius is about to be in full-flower throughout this class and it's a
small class as these classes were, I'll focus more on you, I'll give
you more of my attention. If I'm told "not so much for you," you'll
suffer relative to him. And so the Pygmalion effect shows how our
expectations can really matter.</p>

<p>This brings us to the final--the issue of expectations and how we
judge people is a story that could be told about individuals but it's
also a story that could be told about groups. And this is where I want
to end this section on social psychology by talking about groups. A lot
of social psychology is concerned with the question of how we think
about human groups and we've already discussed this in the lecture on
morality when we talked about the human dynamic pushing us to think in
terms of "us" versus "them" as shown in the Robber's Cave study and
also shown in the minimal group research by Tajfel showing that from a
motivational, emotional standpoint it's not difficult for us to think
in terms of "my group" versus "your group." And this way of thinking
has real consequences for our emotional life, our affective life, and
how we choose to distribute resources. What I want to talk about here
though is a different aspect of how we think about human groups. I want
to talk a little bit about stereotypes.</p>

<p>Now, "stereotypes" in English often just is a bad word. To have a
stereotype is to be--is to have something wrong with you. You might say
it's not good to have stereotypes. Psychologists tend to use the term
in a broader sense. We tend to use the term to refer to information we
have about categories and intuitions we have about the typicality, our
frequency of certain features of categories. And it turns out that
collecting information about categories is essential to our survival.
We see novel things all the time and if we were not capable of learning
and making guesses, educated guesses, about these novel things we would
not be able to survive. So, when you see this object over here you
categorize it as a chair and you recognize that you could probably sit
on it. This apple is probably edible, this dog probably barks and has a
tail and eat me--eats me and doesn't speak English. These are all
stereotypes about chairs and about apples and about dogs. It doesn't
mean they're logically true. This could be a vegetarian dog, a poison
apple, an explosive chair, but [laughter] they're typically true. And
if you were suddenly stripped of your ability to make generalizations,
you'd be at a loss. You wouldn't know what to eat, how to interact. So,
some sort of ability to record information and make generalizations is
absolutely essential to making it through life.</p>

<p>What's interesting though is we also categorize types of people. So,
we have stereotypes in our heads about men and women, about children,
adolescents or adults, whites, blacks, Asians and so on. Now, this is
not essentially a bad thing for a couple of reasons. First, some of
these stereotypes are positive. You might have positive stereotypes
about certain groups. You might believe some groups are unusually
creative or intelligent. You might have a particularly positive
stereotype about your own group even if your own group is Yale students
or your own group is people from France or your own group is people
from such and so college. You might have positive stereotypes. More
importantly, we collect stereotypes about groups of people through much
the same way we collect stereotypes about categories like chairs and
apples and dogs. And so they're pretty often accurate.</p>

<p>When there are studies which ask people who is more likely to be a
lawyer, someone who's Jewish or someone who is Hispanic, who is likely
to be taller, somebody from Japan or somebody from Sweden, people can
answer these things. They have their stereotypes that guide their
answers, and the answers are not arbitrary or random. Their answers are
often correct and often possessing stereotypes lets us make reasonable
and correct generalizations about the world.</p>

<p>That's the sort of good news about stereotypes but there's also bad
news. One problem is that they're not always accurate and there's a
couple of factors that could lead them away from accuracy. One is what
we talked about before regarding first impressions, which is a
confirmation bias. If you believe that homosexuals are effeminate, that
gay men are effeminate, then this is going to shape how you see future
gay men. If you see an effeminate gay man, you'll probably say, "Ah,
more evidence for my theory." If you see a man who is not effeminate,
you might ignore it or say maybe he's not really gay after all. If you
believe black men are criminals, then when you see a black man who is a
criminal you'll chalk it down as support but you'll pay less attention
to evidence that white men are criminals and some black men are not
criminals. You won't look at this as a scientist objectively scanning
data. Rather, you'll be biased in certain ways. You'll be biased to put
extra weight on the cases that support your theory and diminish cases
that refute it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, our data is not always reliable. So--oh, and this is
actually an example of this at work. It turns out in the world of
classical music there's a stereotype of women being simply less
proficient than men: they play smaller than men, they don't have the
same force and they have smaller techniques, they're more temperamental
and so on. If you asked somebody who was a judge, the judge would say,
"Look. This is just the way things are. I'm not being biased at all."
The test of this then is to have blind auditions where people do their
auditions behind a screen so you can't tell whether they're man or a
woman, or for that matter, white or black or Asian or whatever. It
turns out when you do that women get hired far more suggesting that the
stereotype is A, incorrect and B, has a real negative and unfair effect
on people getting hired.</p>

<p>A second problem is – what I was talking about immediately before
this – is some of our data are misleading so we get a lot of the
information about the world from the media. The media would include
television and movies but would also include plays and books and
stories. And to the extent these portray an unrealistic or unfair or
biased perception of the world we could construct stereotypes that are
faithful to the data we're getting but the data is not representative.
And so people, for instance, object to the fact that when there's
Italian Americans on TV they're often members of the Sopranos, a
mobster family. Throughout history Jews have been upset at the
portrayal of Shylock in "Merchant of Venice," not a very nice guy. And
often in response people who want to foster more positive views will
often try to--will often put in representatives from other groups in
unusual ways to make that point. Anybody here ever see the television
show <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>? Okay. Who's that? He's the star of
"Battlestar Galactica." You don't know because you're too young. In the
original "Battlestar"--[laughter] and I hate you. [laughter] In the
original "Battlestar Galactica," this was the star. This was the main
character known as "Starbuck," who got transformed into a woman in the
more recent one, a sort of example of how portrayals are shifting in
interesting ways.</p>

<p>There's also, of course, moral problems over stereotypes. So, it's
fine to judge chairs and apples and dogs based on the stereotypes. It's
even fine to judge breeds of dogs. If I told you that I decided to buy
a greyhound instead of a pit bull because I wanted a dog of a gentle
temperament, nobody would scream that I'm a dog racist [laughter]
involving--and--but honestly, it's a stereotype. Greyhounds are
supposed to be more passive and gentle than pit bulls. I think it's a
true stereotype but it's a stereotype nonetheless. But we have no
problems when it comes to things like breeds of dogs with stereotypes.
We have serious problems judging people this way. So, for instance,
it's a moral principle that some of us would hold to that even if
stereotypes are correct it is still immoral to apply them in day to day
life. The term for this would be "profiling."</p>

<p>Now, it gets complicated because there are some cases where we do
allow stereotypes to play a role. When you all go and get driver's
licenses or when you did get driver's licenses you have to pay higher
auto insurance premiums than I do. I think this is perfectly fair
because young people like you get into a lot more accidents with your
reefer and your alcohol [laughter] and so it is--now, some of you are
saying "that's a stereotype." And it is a stereotype but it's a
statistically robust one and nobody lines up to protest this. It's an
acceptable stereotype to make a generalization from. On the other hand,
what if insurance companies determined that people from Asia got into
more accidents than people from Europe? Would people be equally
comfortable charging people from Asia higher rates of insurance? Almost
certainly not. So, the issues are complicated as to what sort of
generalizations we're--are reasonable to make and what aren't.</p>

<p>There's also a second problem. Stereotypes have all sorts of
effects. Now, some of them are obvious effects. If people--for
instance, if people pull you over while you're driving because you're
black, this could have a huge effect on how you feel welcome in this
society on race relations and so on. But some of the effects are more
subtle and more interesting and you might not expect this. And this is
some work done by the psychologist Claude Steele and his colleagues at
Stanford. And the issue is called "stereotype threat." Imagine you have
a math test and this is the front of the math test. Claude Steele made
an interesting discovery. Here is how to make black people do worse on
this math test. It's very simple. The finding is that if your race or
your group has a negative stereotype associated with it in any
particular domain, being reminded of it serves as a stereotype threat
and hence damages your performance in all sorts of domains. If the
stereotype is "your group doesn't do good in this," if I remind you
that you're a member of that group immediately before doing it, your
performance will drop. Now, you know how to make women do worse on math
tests too, like that, and this has a demonstrative effect.</p>

<p>So, stereotypes are complicated and morally fraught things. When
people study stereotypes they often make certain distinctions between
three levels of stereotypes and this is nicely summarized here. There's
"public." If I asked you: One of the people running for the Democratic
nominee for president is black, another one is female--if I asked
people to raise their hands for who thinks that because being black or
because being female they should be automatically disqualified for
being president, few of you would raise your hands. Those are your
public presentations of stereotypes. Even if I was to ask you on a
sheet of paper, you might deny it because you might be afraid that it's
not anonymous. Then there is private. Private is what you really think
but you don't tell people. Some of you--some of the population of the
United States are not going to vote for somebody because he or she is
black but they won't tell you but they know it to be true. That's
common sense. What's more interesting is below even that there may be
unconscious associations that work that people don't actually know
about but affects their thoughts about race, gender and other social
groups.</p>

<p>So, here are some data about what people publicly say. This is the
proportion of people who say they will vote--they would vote for an
African American president. What's interesting is when--around when I
was born the answer in the United States was about half. Now, it is as
close to one hundred percent as you can get it. Here is another one.
This is also public stereotypes of blacks, proportion of white
respondents endorsing each trait. Now, it's infinitesimal. These
numbers are so low they could be dismissed as people filling in the
wrong things or making jokes or just being confused compared to
[laughter] stunningly superstitious high rankings. And so, there's been
a profound change in public presentations, public views, on race but
what about implicit views? This gets more complicated.</p>

<p>Here is a simple study. This is the sort of study that you might do
here at Yale. What you might do, for instance, is be sitting at a
computer screen and you'll be given incomplete words to fill out like
"hos-" and you have to fill out this word. What you don't know is that
pictures of black faces or pictures of white faces are being flashed on
the screen but they're being flashed on the screen subliminally so fast
you don't even know you're seeing them. Still this has an effect. When
you see black faces subjects are more likely to fill this with words
like "hostile" while whites more likely to fill it with words like
"hospital."</p>

<p>I will now welcome you to participate in an experiment on implicit
attitudes. This was developed by Mahzarin Banaji who used to be at Yale
and now is in an inferior university in Boston [laughter] and it's
called implicit attitudes test and it's the biggest psychology
experiment ever done in terms of people. I don't know. A million people
have participated in this and you could just go online,
implicit.harvard.edu and then you could do it yourself. But we'll do it
now as a group. If you did it in the lab or on your computer screen,
you would do it by pushing buttons. We'll do it by speaking. And it's
very simple. You're going to see things over here and they're either
going to be words or they're going to be pictures. If it's an African
American or a bad word, a negative word, I want you to shout out
"right," this side, "right." If it's a white American or a good word, I
want you to shout out "left." People ready. Try to do it as fast as
possible without making any mistakes. [audience response] [laughter]
Because of the very loud wrong person we're going to try that again.
[laughter] Are you ready? [audience response]</p>

<p>Good. That is "congruent," congruent according to a theory that says
that people, both African Americans and white Americans, have biases to
favor white Americans over African Americans. How do we know by this?
Well, we compare it. That's "congruent." Now, it's different. If it's a
white American or a bad word, say "right." If it's an African American
or a good word, say "left." [audience response] Okay. For all I could
tell, people did equally well but this experiment has been done tens of
thousands of times and you could do it yourself on a computer screen.
And this is one way of doing it but they'll alternate and they'll give
you different ones to shift around and everything. And it turns out
that this version people are slower at than the other version
suggesting that their associations run one way and not the other. And
this work has been extended for all sorts of ways looking at for
example at gender, looking at the connection between women and English
and men and math, looking at age, attitudes towards people who are
obese versus people who are thin, attitudes towards people who are
straight versus people who are gay, and you could go online and do
these studies and it'll give you some feeling for the sort of implicit
attitudes that we have within us.</p>

<p>Well, a legitimate question is "Who cares?" I mean, if you do
the--If you look at the results for the study, it turns out that there
is an association as bias to view white Americans as positive and
African Americans as negative but it shows up in half a second
difference. Who cares? Well, there's two answers to this. One answer is
there are times in your life where half a second can matter a lot. So,
studies with police officers using reaction time in split-second
choices on who to shoot find that your stereotypical attitudes play a
huge role in who you're likely to shoot when they're holding an object
in their hand that's unclear. Also, more generally, it could be that
these implicit attitudes play a role in judgment calls. In cases where
you have a hard decision to make, you know you're not racist. You have
no explicit racist attitudes, honestly you really don't, but the
argument is that these stereotypes can affect your behavior in all
sorts of subtle ways.</p>

<p>Here is one example. What they do is they do an experiment where
somebody is in trouble. You hear a scream from outside either from a
black person or a white person. In one condition you're the only person
around. In another condition there's other people around you. Now, we
know from the work in the Bystander effect that in general which one
are we more likely to help in, when we're the only person or multiple?
[audience response] "Only," exactly. And in fact, when it's the only
person just about everybody helps regardless of the color of the person
in trouble but when you're with other people there's a big difference.
Now, again this isn't--these things are not done with members of the
KKK. They're done with the standard university undergraduates like you
and these--and if you were in this group you wouldn't say, "Oh. I
didn't want to help because the person's black." Rather, what you would
say is, "Well, I didn't think it was worth helping. There were other
people around. Someone else would help," but we know by looking at it
that this difference makes a real difference.</p>

<p>A final study, and this was done by my colleague who just got hired
here, Jack Dovidio, who's done some wonderful work, looked at how
people judge to hire somebody based on their recommendations. This is a
little bit of a confusing thing. The green bars are the African
Americans. The blue bars are the white Americans. And in some cases
these people have strong recommendations. When they have strong
recommendations in 1989 you're willing to hire everybody, and this [the
level of hiring for African versus white Americans, depicted on a
slide] is not a difference at all. But when their recommendations are
so-so, when it's a judgment call, the subjects are significantly more
likely to hire the white American than the African American. Nineteen
eighty-nine was a long time ago but the same results showed up in 1999.
The same results also showed up about a year and a half ago. And again,
this doesn't show that people are explicit terrible racists. It does
show that people possess these stereotypes that make a difference in
their real-world behavior.</p>

<p>A way to put this all together is in Trish Devine's automaticity
theory, which goes something like this. The idea is that everybody
holds stereotypes. These are automatically activated when we come into
contact with individuals. In order to not act in a stereotyped fashion,
we have to consciously push them down, we have to consciously override
them, and that's possible, but it takes work. It takes work both at the
individual level and it takes work at the group level. Any questions or
thoughts about this? Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: It's a good question. These results are
surprising and disturbing and I said there is work to be done at an
individual and group level and this young man challenged me to be more
explicit about that. Here is one case. We have job searches and
sometimes job--senior job searches involve the faculty sitting
in--around in a room and tossing out names and we use these names as a
basis for further discussion. "Hey, I wonder--What about that person?
That person does great work." What we do now in the psychology
department is we make a special point of trying to get names from
disadvantaged groups, not with an eye towards an affirmative action
policy but rather because there's a lot of evidence suggesting that
people who are just as qualified don't come to mind unless you make
some sort of procedure to do it.</p>

<p>Here's another example. A lot of journals do blind reviewing now
because of the evidence I talked about before regarding sexual
stereotypes, that whether it has a male name or a female name makes a
difference. So those are not--those are group level in that they're not
saying, "You get rid of your prejudices by trying harder." It's rather,
"Let's set up a system so that your prejudices can't work," the blind
auditions, for instance, being a beautiful example of that. At an
individual level, your question's a harder one and I'm not exactly sure
what we could do but I think what we should do is be conscious of these
things and know that it's not enough to say, "Well, I'm explicitly not
racist so I'll give everybody a fair shake," but to recognize we might
have biases and to work hard to overcome them, not by overcorrecting in
some random way but trying to--if you're interested for instance in
qualifications setting up some system that these qualifications can be
observed absent knowledge of race or sex. Yeah, in back.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Yes. The question's a good one. How
much of this is due to stereotypes and how much of this is due to an
own-group bias? So, the fact that--so, the experiments as I have
described them are to some extent ambiguous. The fact that white
Americans favor white Americans over black Americans might be because
of stereotypes but they also might be of in-group favoritism. I think
the answer is that both play a role but some of the effects are due to
stereotypes above and beyond in-group favoritism. And one reason why we
know that is in studies like the IAT, the Implicit Attitudes Test.
African Americans show much the same effect as white Americans. So,
African Americans also are biased against African Americans and in
favor of white Americans, showing it doesn't reduce to group favoritism
though that probably plays a big role.</p>

<p>Okay. I'm going to shift and spend the rest of this class on a
couple of mysteries. Here's a summary. The first one is a minor
mystery. I think we have some progress in explaining it. The second one
is a total mystery. The first one's sleep. Sleep is a motivation. It is
a motivation like food or drink. It is a form of torture. I won't get
into definitions of what torture is but it would cause somebody
tremendous pain and anguish to keep them from sleeping. When you're
really tired sleep is what you want to do like when you're really
hungry you want to eat. How many people here on average--from the
beginning of the semester until now get on average more than eight
hours of sleep a night? That's good. Good.</p>

<p>There is a sort of school of sleep macho. A sleep macho used to be
"I only get forty-two minutes of sleep a night." Now sleep macho is "I
sleep eleven hours." [laughter] Who gets on average more than seven? On
average more than six? Who here has been making it since the beginning
of the semester on under six hours a night? Okay. Anybody of you that
has been getting under five hours a night? Okay. There is big
individual differences in how much sleep people need and sleep itself
is what we spend a lot of our life on but it's very hard to study and
we didn't used to know much of it because you can't ask people what's
happening during it because they're sleeping so you need sort of clever
methods. One such clever method is an EEG. You bring somebody in the
sleep lab, you put electrodes on their scalp and you see what
these--what sort of electrical activities you get in the brain. Right
now many of you are showing irregular beta waves suggesting intense
comprehension and great intellectual focus. [laughter] Some of you are
awake but non attentive and your brain's giving you these large,
regular alpha waves. Some of you are sound asleep, deep in delta.
[laughter]</p>

<p>When you sleep you get the following stages. You start off with a
transition period when you're falling asleep. We call that stage I.
Then you get successively deeper, II through IV, slow, irregular, high
amplitude delta waves, and then once you reach stage IV you start going
up again, up through stage III and II. Then REM sleep emerges, rapid
eye movement sleep. REM sleep is neat because your brain looks like
it's wide awake but – and I'm going to talk a little bit more in detail
about this later – you're relaxed, your rapid eye movements occur;
that's where your--the name comes from and dreams occur and then on a
good night's sleep you've got four to five sleep cycles and it looks
like this. You start off and you go down, down, down, and then you come
up, then you get your first REM cycle, again, again, again, again,
again, and then you wake up.</p>

<p>So, the general takeaway message here is that there's two types of
sleep. There is slow-wave sleep or "quiet sleep." Your eyes drift
separately and slowly you're hard to wake up. Then there is REM sleep.
Your brain is active as if you were awake, your EEGs are similar to
waking, paralyzed except for the eyes, oh, men get erections and you
have dreams. One sleep researcher joked that these two are connected
because what happens is dreams fly around through the ether and then
their erections serve as antennas so you pick them up. [laughter] Don't
write that down. [laughter]</p>

<p>Why do we sleep and why don't we--why aren't we always awake?
There's a couple of answers to this. Probably the best answer is our
body is worn out during the day and sleep is necessary to put it back
into shape. So, when you sleep growth producing hormone goes through
the body, your brain and other organs get restored, there are--you need
less food, your immune system seems to be hard at work, and in fact,
one answer--people always wonder what happens if you'd stop sleeping
and the answer is not one discovered in the laboratory but it's been
recorded in different cases. If you stop sleeping you die. You don't
die in some dramatic way. You get sick and then you die, suggesting
that sleeping is good to keep you healthy. And an analogy I like to
think about is that your--when you bring your car in to repair it--for
repairs, when you're repairing your car, the first thing you do is you
stomp it and shut off the engine. You make it stable and at rest so you
can then work on repair. A related view is that sleep emerged to
preserve energy and keep you out of trouble at night. And these views
are of course not incompatible. This explains why we sleep at all and
this probably explains why we sleep at night.</p>

<p>There are sleep disorders. I won't go through them. I just list a
few of them here. They're sort of bad things that could happen to you
when you're asleep. One particularly trendy sleep disorder that's been
discovered recently are side effects of sleeping pills such as Ambien.
So, one of the bizarre side effects is some people with Ambien while
sleeping go downstairs, open up their refrigerator and eat huge amounts
of food. [laughter] A more recent side effect of Ambien that's quite
serious is some people become--have the compulsion while they're
sleeping to go driving, which is not good. [laughter]</p>

<p>What we're really interested in though when it comes to sleep is
dreams. So, remember Hamlet. People--you've all studied Hamlet, "to be
or not to be." That's all I know but basically [laughter] he was
deciding--he--I wrote this down though. He was deciding whether or not
to kill himself and so he made up two lists. The lists of reasons to
kill himself were "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune," "a sea
of troubles," and "the heartache in the thousand natural shocks that
flesh is heir to." He only had one argument not to kill himself:
Nightmares. "To sleep, perchance to dream, for in that sleep of death
what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil might
give us pause." He was worried about nightmares.</p>

<p>Now, dreams have always fascinated people and philosophers. If you
take a philosophy course, there'll be a couple of questions about
dreams that you will wonder about. One is "Are you dreaming right now?"
So, Rene Descartes famously wondered whether the real world doesn't
exist. Maybe right now it's just a dream. See also "The Matrix." And
can you be immoral in a dream? We do all sorts of things in dreams that
are bad. Are these sins? And the great theologians and philosophers
like Augustine wondered about this, can you sin in a dream? I will
answer both questions. You are not dreaming right now, unless you're
asleep but if you're--and you can't usually be immoral in a dream. The
exceptions are lucid dreams where you choose what to dream about, and
then possibly you could be immoral if you encourage bad habits of
thought.</p>

<p>What do we know about dreams? Well, first there's a distinction, a
distinction between real dreams versus sleep thought. So, real dreams
are you're in a submarine wrestling a chicken while your grandmother
looks disapprovingly on. Those are real dreams. "Sleep thought" is the
sort of thing you get typically before you fall asleep and it's like
"did I take the garbage out, where is the garbage, did I take the
garbage out?" And so it's really just this kind of rumination and you
could do this while you're sleeping. So, if you're woken up during
slow-wave sleep you're going to be thinking "Did I take the--yes, while
I was dreaming I was thinking about the garbage," but if you're woken
up during REM, "But a monkey was eating my grandmother," and that sort
of thing. [laughter] So, there is a distinction.</p>

<p>What do people dream about? Well, we know some facts about dreams.
Everybody dreams. Not everybody remembers their dreams. If you want to
remember your dream by the way keep your dreams--keep a dream diary,
very useful, but everybody dreams three to four times a night. That
depends on how much sleep you get but dreams leave fragile memories.
They fade quickly. This is why a dream diary or writing up--writing
your dreams as soon as you wake up turns out to be useful.</p>

<p>What do people dream about? Well, basically, the way to find that
out is you ask people and people have--psychologists and sociologists
have collected dream reports. If you go to dreambank.net, a guy named
Hill collected 50,000 dream reports; you could make some
generalizations. Most dreams are bad. They're not bad, bad, they're not
nightmares, but most dreams are from a scale of one to ten with five
and a half in the middle they're on the negative side. They report
misfortunes. People in tribal societies have dreams with more physical
aggression than people in industrialized societies. Men have more
aggressive dreams than women. Americans have more aggressive dreams
than Europeans. Yeah. [laughter]</p>

<p>What do people want to dream about? Well, psychologist--the findings
were totally not going to surprise you. Women want to dream about
romance and adventure. Men want to dream about sex with strangers.
[laughter] Turns out that once you get past the hormonal blast of
adolescence about 10% of dreams have explicit sexual content.</p>

<p>What's the most common dream? Guesses. Falling. That's a good guess.
Falling is among the top dreams but falling is not the winner. Somebody
else. Flying? Also close. Public speaking? Good phobic dream but not
it. Naked in public, not it. [laughter] Excellent. Being chased.
Evolutionary psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists have puzzled
over this one. It seems to be sort of a primal dream but the dream
about being chased is a biggie. Has anybody here ever dreamt of being
chased that you could remember? Yeah. Being chased is the big one.
Naked in public? [laughter] Grandmother killed by a monkey? [laughter]
No.</p>

<p>So, what are dreams for? There are Freudian theories that dreams are
disguised with fulfillment and other things. There is not much support
for these. One theory which is popular is that dreams are a side effect
of memory consolidation so your body, sort of below the neck, rebuilds
itself while you're sleeping but also what happens while you're
sleeping is your memories get played over and over again to consolidate
them into different parts of the brain. Almost--the best analogy here
is backing up a computer. Your brain backs itself up. In the course of
backing itself up, there are sort of random events flash to
consciousness and get put together in a coherent story. From this
perspective, dreams serve no adaptive function at all but rather
they're epiphenomena. They are the byproducts of another system.</p>

<p>Final topic is laughter and this is a true mystery. I got interested
in this--well, I got interested in this as a developmental psychologist
watching my own children laugh and trying to figure out what it is that
made them laugh. This is my son, Zachary, pretty young [clip playing]
but [laughter] this is not the youngest record of laughing. I found
this on the web. [clip playing of an infant laughing] [laughter] It's a
huge puzzle. From an evolutionary point of view, people's pursuit of
sex and food and drink and sleep are not these huge mysteries, our
abilities to understand language and make sense of the visual world and
cohere in groups, but the fact that we make this weird noise at bizarre
circumstances is a huge puzzle and typical--typically psychologists
have failed to explain this puzzle.</p>

<p>So, here's something; here's a first guess I read in a neuroscience
textbook. "We laugh when there is incongruity between what we expect
and what we actually--what actually happens unless the outcome is
frightening." [laughter] Now, this is a fair effort. It is about as
wrong as anything can be wrong in any possible way. [laughter] The
first thing is it doesn't really explain "why?" So, why should a
non-frightening incongruity cause people to make a distinctive loud
noise consisted of staccato segments of one fifteenth of a second each
separated by a fifth of a second? It doesn't explain why we make that
loud noise when dealing with incongruity. It's not the case that
incongruity causes laughter. If there was a bowl of fruit up there as
you walked in, it'd be incongruous but people wouldn't shriek with
laughter and point to the fruit. [laughter] It's also--a lot of
laughter isn't caused by incongruity so a lot of times when we laugh
there's nothing incongruous in any deep sense about it. So, laughter is
kind of a puzzle. We don't know why we laugh. We don't know what makes
us laugh.</p>

<p>Over the last five, ten years there's been some work done on this. A
lot of the work is done by Robert Provine who summarizes this in his
excellent book <i>Laughter.</i> And Provine decided to do something
that nobody in the history of the world has done. He decided to send
himself and his students to different places including shopping malls
and observe when people laughed and write down what made them laugh.
And this is the first descriptive step to developing a theory of
laughter. And his big finding is that you could separate people--you
could separate the question of laughter from the question of a joke or
the question of humor. Most of what people--what made people laugh
wasn't in any sense a joke or humorous.</p>

<p>So, he had over a thousand laughter-initiated situations and here
are some typical comments that initiated laughter, sometimes uproarious
laughter, on the parts of people. "I'll see you guys later." "Look.
It's Andre." [laughter] "Are you sure?" "I know." "How are you?" "I try
to lead a normal life." It's sort of funny. [laughter] It was anyway in
a context where it wasn't particularly amusing. "It wasn't you." "We
can handle this." Only ten percent of the comments were--could be
re-coded later on as people--as actually humorous in any sense. And
these included "Poor boy looks just like his father," [laughter] "You
smell like you've had a good workout," [laughter] "Did you find that in
your nose?", [laughter] a reference to dormitory food, [laughter], "He
has a job pulling back skin in the operating room." [laughter]</p>

<p>So, Provine suggests we separate the question of laughter and jokes
and then ask what do we know about laughter? Well, here are some basic
facts that--remember we're trying to think like evolutionary biologists
here. Humans have this universal trait. There's no society without
laughter. It's early emerging as we saw in those clips. So, what's it
for? What does it do? If it's an accident, what's it an accident from?
What properties does it have? And there are some properties that are
important to know. It's social and communicative. Why do we know that?
Because it's loud. Laughter is not like hunger. Hunger can be silent.
Hunger is not essentially a message to other people but when humans –
when it involves a loud noise – the reason why we've evolved loud
noises is to communicate with other people.</p>

<p>Laughter could be viewed as a form of involuntary noisemaking and
it's contagious. That's another interesting thing about it. One of the
great discoveries in television and movies was the invention of the
laugh track. The laugh track makes things a lot funnier because people
laugh a lot more when they're in groups. The rim shot after a comic
remark is an attempt to simulate--sort of a pre-technological attempt
to simulate the sound of laughter. Children are particularly influenced
by the contagiousness of laughter, but just in general, if you hear
somebody laughing, like the kids you saw before, it's the sort of thing
that could easily make you laugh.</p>

<p>Other primates do it to some extent and then it's interesting when
they do it. Monkeys laugh when they attack. When monkeys get together
to kill and eat somebody they make a kind of a laughing noise and
chimpanzees laugh when they tickle each other.</p>

<p>And then you'll see--And what's tickling? Well, a fair definition of
tickling is touching parts of the body in a mock attack. You sort of
attack somebody and they're laughing but if it's--but if somebody's
trying to mug you you're not "Ah, this is so funny." [laughter] You
have to realize that this is a mock attack; you're simulating attack.
So one theory is--is a signal of mock aggression and collective
aggression. It's basically--it's like a sound of some sort of mob
attack. It's mock aggression in the sense that when people laugh
they're often teasing, kidding around. They're throwing out insults,
maybe they're tickling each other, maybe they're making fun of each
other, maybe they're making fun of themselves, and there's some
aggression to it. Most laughter is inspired by some degree of
aggression, but it's attenuated and it's not real. And the laughter is
a signal this isn't real. And collective aggression--a lot of mob
assaults, executions, lynchings, rapes are accompanied with the sound
of laughter. When you're in a group doing something terribly aggressive
and you are not--you don't feel like you're at risk you might laugh and
laughter is a signal to other members of your group as a signal of
solidarity and what you're doing together.</p>

<p>A different way of putting it--and none of this is going to come in
with a sharp, decisive theory. These are sort of flailing away at
different ideas but another way of doing--an older way is proposed by
Plato, who viewed laughter as a form of bonding against a common enemy.
It's a sound of group cohesion against the common enemy. Comedians have
not missed the aggressive nature of laughter. Dave Barry writes:</p>

<blockquote>The most important humor truth of all is that to really see
the humor in a situation you have to have perspective. Perspective is
derived from two ancient Greek words, ‘pers' meaning something bad that
happens to someone else and ‘ective' meaning ideally somebody like
Donald Trump.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>[laughter] And the idea is that it's something bad happening but not
to you or to somebody you love. Mel Brooks puts it in somewhat sharper
terms, distinguishing between comedy and tragedy: "Tragedy is when I
cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall in an open sewer and die."
[laughter]</p>

<p>To sum up, ingredients of humor is there has to be a target who
experiences some harm. It could be an enemy. It could be a friend. It
could be yourself. The harm shouldn't be so serious that it elicits
strong negative emotions like fear, grief or pity. So, if a stranger
slips on a banana peel and lands on his butt, I might laugh because I'm
not overcome by compassion. If he splits his head open and there's
blood everywhere, I'm less likely to laugh unless I don't like him or
something. [laughter] And this is why the humor--why the damage is
often a certain sort of damage involving things like embarrassment,
sex, scatology, a banana peel, pie in the face, your pants fall down or
something, where there's no real harm. So, empathy, caring, sympathy
don't kick in, but instead there's the aggression unleashed at somebody
and there has to be some level of surprise.</p>

<p>This is what--this is where the humor for that baby comes in, which
is you couldn't predict when the sound was coming and some aspect of
that was what made it so funny then, what elicited the laughter. This
is--what elicited the laughter for Zachary was watching the classic
film <em>Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day</em> where Rabbit climbed
on a high bunch of shelves and it all came crashing down on him. But he
didn't--he wasn't dead. He was just kind of stunned. [laughter]</p>

<p>Final question for anybody interested in laughter is, "Why can't we
tickle ourselves?" Now, I've talked about laughter on two separate
occasions and on each of the occasions when I talked in front of a
large group like this somebody came up to me afterwards and said, "But
I can." [laughter] And [laughter] I don't--and they seemed sincere but
if people say, "I can tickle myself," how many people here will own up
to being able to tickle themselves? One? [laughter] It's a fascinating
question why some people can. The general story of why we can't in
general is because there's no surprise, there's no mock aggression, and
also there may be a general deadening of self-stimulation.</p>

<p>I'm going to end with the final reading response. Think of an
interesting testable idea about either dreams or laughter. You could go
into as much detail as you want. If you want your thing could be one
sentence long but it could be longer. I will ask the teaching fellows
to each send me their one or two most interesting remarks. I will then
judge and then the winner will win some small prize, either of a
literary or a food nature. Okay. I'll see you all on Wednesday.</p>
