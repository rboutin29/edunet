<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: The final topic of the course is
clinical psychology, also known as abnormal psychology or
psychopathology, and this, for many of us, is what psychology is really
about. It's about mental illness. It's about clinical psychologists.
And we started talking about this when Dr. Nolen-Hoeksema gave her
guest lecture last week and I want to continue through this today. It
is a topic of tremendous scientific importance but also a topic of
great personal importance for many of us. Many of the people in this
room have been mentally ill, strictly speaking, at some point in their
lives. Some of you are under some sort of therapy or treatment or
medical intervention right now. Some of you are on Prozac or Zoloft or
Ambien or Wellbutrin or any of those other medications to deal with
psychological problems you are facing. Others are also talking to
psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and other people.</p>

<p>Many of you who are not at this point mentally ill will become
mentally ill during your stay at Yale. [laughter] And this is a
difficult period in many people's lives and it's a period of people's
lives where mental illness emerges in many of us. By one estimate, one
half of all college graduates in the United States – and the number is
very high with college graduates, highly educated people – one half of
you will have some sort of mental illness in your life serious enough
to require some sort of treatment. Those of you not directly affected
with mental illness yourselves will no doubt experience your loved
ones, your family, your friends getting some sort of illness, be it
Alzheimer's or schizophrenia or depression or some sort of anxiety
disorder. So the personal importance of clinical psychology, the
personal importance of understanding what can go wrong and how best to
treat it, simply can't be underestimated.</p>

<p>Now, when we talk about mental disorders, the scope of this is very
broad. It includes the prototypical schizophrenic which you could see
on the streets of New Haven, somebody walking and gesturing and talking
to themselves and sometimes screaming. It includes alcohol addiction
and cocaine addiction and other addictions. It includes somebody with
Down syndrome or autism, an old person losing his memory, a teenager
falling into a deep depression, somebody with a severe social phobia to
the extent that he or she can't leave the house. Then there are also
very hard cases where it's difficult to say one way or another--that
guy's photographing me as I'm talking and it's freaking me out [laughs]
[laughter] in kind of a social phobia way. There's difficult cases
where it's just hard to tell mental illness from just [laughter as
Professor Bloom waves goodbye to the photographer] bad behavior in
general. So, consider a killer without a conscience or a mobster like
John Gotti. Is he mentally ill? And this is a question which is a deep
one and we'll wrestle with it a little bit actually towards the end of
this lecture.</p>

<p>What about somebody who acts in a kind of unusual or zany way? This
is originally supposed to be a picture of the character Kramer on
"Seinfeld" but, given his unusual antics in the last few months, it
could be a picture of the actor who plays him who got into all sorts of
trouble. What about someone who is just kind of wacky? At what point
does wackiness move into the domain of mental illness? What about
unusual lifestyles such as extreme altruism? Batman devotes most of his
life to helping others. He sleeps one hour a night and this hour is
fraught with nightmares and then he fights crime. What about somebody,
and this was a case reported in <i>The New Yorker</i> a few months ago,
who has lots of money and a loving family and has his kidney removed to
help a stranger? And he says, "I have two kidneys. It's minor pain, a
minor operation. I could save someone's life." And his wife says,
"You're mentally ill. That's just crazy to do that." Where do we draw
the line? And so, there are these great philosophical and moral
questions over the boundaries and how to think about mental
illness.</p>

<p>So, how should we think about mental illness? Well, there are some
answers we could quickly dispense with. It used to be thought that
severe mental illness was a result of demonic possession. If you read
the Gospels, Jesus Christ wandered around a lot, met crazy people and
exorcised the demons from their bodies. It was a common way of thinking
about craziness. We now believe that this is not true. What
about--yeah, it's not true. What about social deviants? Some people
including the psychiatrist Thomas Szasz claim that when we label
somebody as mentally ill this is not a medical decision. It's rather a
social decision designed to ostracize people who deviate from society's
norms, to ostracize them and rid them of moral agency. It's not that we
disagree with them. It's not even that we see them as evil. Rather, we
see them as sick and as such we don't even have to accord to them the
respect that we accord to criminals.</p>

<p>Now, this is not entirely an unreasonable view. In many countries
around the world, dissidents, people who argue against the state, are
often determined to be mentally ill and thrown in asylums. Blacks in
the United States who tried to escape from slavery were described as
having a mental illness. Why would they want to do so unless they were
mentally ill? Up until 1973, to be a homosexual, to be gay, would count
in the official records of how we classify illness as being mentally
ill. And many people saw this, and we see this now, not so much as
reflecting a sort of unbiased medical analysis but rather as reflecting
biases that people have against gay people. And these are political and
social and moral biases. They are not objective medical judgments. Even
now I've been recording every president that has been the president of
the United States in my memory including Bush and particularly Clinton
has been described by his opponents not merely as awful, evil,
terrible, "hate his policies," but as mentally ill. Every president at
some point or another, some bright, intelligent person figures to call
him a psychopath and put that in <i>Time</i> magazine. Now, put aside
whether--the extent to which these things are accurate, point being
that we often use medical labels, particularly labels like
"psychopath," "schizophrenic," "delusional," to ostracize and pick out
people we disagree with.</p>

<p>At the same time though, this is not entirely right. People go too
far when they say there's no such thing as mental illness. Some people
are mentally ill in a very real sense of "illness," in the same sense
we would describe somebody as physically ill if they were to have
cancer. This illness damages their functioning. They cannot function
well. They do not tend to be more creative or more productive or more
vivacious. Rather, for – with very few exceptions; possibly some
exceptions revolving around mania as Dr. Nolen-Hoeksema discussed –
with very few exceptions being mentally ill is just very bad for you in
every possible way. Moreover, when people are treated, when people get
better, they become more competent, happier, better able to participate
in the world, and they do not choose to go back to their mental
illness, suggesting that it really is illness in the serious sense. And
so the modern treatment of psychological disorders treats them as
disorders like medical disorders. Schizophrenia is as much a disease as
is cancer and should be thought of in the same way.</p>

<p>There's a whole field of abnormal psychology of tremendous scope.
We've already discussed many mental illnesses in the context of other
things. So, for instance, we talked about amnesia in the context of
memory and how it works. We talked about autism in the context of
social reasoning. There are many more and I'm not going to read through
them. These are the major categories just for people's interest from
<i>The Diagnostic and Standard Manual.</i> You don't have to--you're
not responsible for all of these. And this is an illustration, which
people might find interesting, of sex differences in these--in the
major disorders. And the patterns, as you could see, are kind of neat.
Women are more prone to have anxiety disorders and mood disorders. Men
are much more likely to suffer from substance disorders, particularly
alcoholism. Schizophrenia is sort of evenly matched but antisocial
personality disorders, sometimes known as sociopathy or psychopathy, is
predominantly male. And we'll turn to that a bit later.</p>

<p>Here are the major ones which I want to review today. I'm not going
to talk about mood disorders at all because this was the topic of the
superb lecture we heard last week but I want to quickly review
schizophrenia, the class of disorders known as anxiety disorders, the
class of disorders known as dissociative disorders, and the class of
disorders known as personality disorders. And these are the main
psychological problems. When a psychologist or psychiatrist does his or
her work, they're predominantly focused on somebody who has one of
these problems. Some of them are rare but some of them such as anxiety
disorders and the mood disorders are very common.</p>

<p>About 1% of the world's population suffers from schizophrenia and
this is the most common reason for being in a mental hospital. And the
reason for that is because of its severity, because of how terrible an
illness it is. Schizophrenics have been described as the lepers of the
twentieth century by people who pointed out that in the last hundred
years people who are schizophrenics are just--there's no place for them
in society. They're shunned. They're rejected. We have no idea how to
treat them or how to help them. The roots of schizophrenia come from
the terms "split" and "mind" but the idea is there is a split from
reality. It's important to stress the sort of etymological point
because sometimes people confuse schizophrenia with something--with
split personality and they somehow think schizophrenia refers to having
multiple personalities. This is incorrect. A multiple personality
disorder is an entirely different disorder. It's a sort of dissociative
disorder. Split personality--people with schizophrenia do not have
multiple personalities. What they have is a problem with relating to
reality. It's roughly equally split between the genders but it strikes
men earlier and it happens between--around these ages and as you could
see roughly--and, as you could see, it is the sort of thing that could
make its first occurrence while you're in college or university.</p>

<p>There are five symptoms – main symptoms of schizophrenia. Four of
them are the positive symptoms, meaning things that you do, that you
have that's unusual. One is a negative symptom, something that you
don't have, something that a schizophrenic lacks. So, just to walk
through them, a hallucination is an experience, a sensory experience,
that isn't real. So, the most typical hallucinations are auditory.
Schizophrenics hear voices. They hear sounds, particularly people
telling them to do things, that aren't real. Sometimes there are
auditory--there are visual hallucinations or hallucinations of smell
and taste but a typical hallucination is auditory. Sometimes the voices
are seen from coming from oneself and so you could sometimes stop the
hallucinations by doing things like humming or counting or holding your
mouth open. And some schizophrenics will do this in an attempt to block
auditory hallucinations.</p>

<p>There are delusions. The difference between a hallucination and a
delusion is a hallucination is a sensory experience that's wrong, that
just didn't really happen. A delusion is a belief that isn't right.
It's a belief that you shouldn't be having. Now, again, the question of
what counts as a delusion and what counts as accuracy can be a
controversial one. Richard Dawkins titled his recent book <i>The God
Delusion,</i> describing this mass delusion that many people have that
they believe there's a supernatural being who created the universe and
who is watching them. Some people find that offensive, to call it a
delusion and people will have different views.</p>

<p>The delusions schizophrenics have tend to be pretty clearly weird
and wrong. They often tend to believe they are famous people. Many
schizophrenics have a religious bent and believe that they are Jesus
Christ. In 1959, there was a Michigan hospital that had three Jesus
Christs in it and they would meet and talk. One theme of delusions is
what's called "ideas of reference." And ideas of reference are you
think that there's all sorts of things happening that revolve around
you. You hear people whispering and you think they're talking about
you. You pick up the newspaper and you believe that there's coded
messages in it that are directed towards you. You might believe that
there is some sort of omnipotent, powerful force conspiring against you
or trying to manipulate you like aliens or the FBI, the CIA, the
government. You might believe that they have some sort of evil plan in
mind for you.</p>

<p>There is disorganized speech. Some schizophrenics babble. They talk
and it's nonsense. If you listen to a schizophrenic on the street,
sometimes what they're saying makes no sense at all, not merely that
they're conveying ideas that are unreasonable but it's just garbled,
it's just a mess. And sometimes there is disorganized behavior too, odd
motor movements. And the most extreme cases of this are motor movements
described as "catatonic" where the person doesn't move, often freezes
in a position.</p>

<p>Those are all positive symptoms. A major negative symptom in
schizophrenia is absence of normal thought or affect, affect meaning
emotion. So some schizophrenics might just not talk. They might have
very low emotional responses. They might not care about anything.</p>

<p>The basic psychological misfunction--oh, sorry. There are different
subtypes of schizophrenia. There are five major subtypes but I'm going
to focus on the three major ones, the three most interesting ones. The
first one is paranoid schizophrenia. So, paranoid schizophrenics
believe that others are spying and plotting against them. And they
often have delusions of grandeur. They often believe that other people
are jealous of them. They might believe they have supernatural powers.
They might believe that they're God or a messiah. The catatonic
schizophrenics are unresponsive to their surroundings and often they'll
just repeat what people say to them, they won't generate their own
speech. And finally, the disorganized schizophrenics are maybe what you
most think of when you think of somebody who is insane. They make no
sense. They have delusions and hallucinations. They babble. They--their
actions--they could be dangerous. They could be perceived as dangerous.
They're unable to help themselves. They're unable to do anything in
their lives.</p>

<p>It's hard to pin down exactly what's at root of all of these
problems but a very general summary is that there is a problem – an
inability to put together your thoughts and perceptions, to sequence
them and coordinate them, to impose a logical structure and a
reasonable, realistic temporal sequence on your experience. This is the
core thing going wrong but what happens as a result of this is you lose
contact with others, you lose social contact. Losing social contact
means you don't get much reality checking. If I start acting weird and
nobody cares, I could just get weirder and weirder, while if I'm in a
good social group of people who care about me often the situation could
be brought under control. So, schizophrenia is sort of a vicious circle
where you have this cognitive problem. Then you have problems losing
contact with others, exaggerating the cognitive problem, and so on.</p>

<p>A lot of people have studied the genetics of schizophrenia. It's
clear enough that there is a powerful genetic component. I could--you
can tell how much at risk somebody is for becoming schizophrenic based
on the schizophrenia and illness of their family members. In
particular, if you have an identical twin who's schizophrenic, your
odds are about a half of becoming schizophrenic yourself. At the same
time, and we dealt with this as well when we talked about issues of
sexual orientation, the fact that identical twins the odds are only 50%
means there has to be an environmental component to it. If it was
entirely genetic, it would be 100%. And so one claim--one way of
looking at it is your genes make you vulnerable to schizophrenia but
whether or not you become schizophrenic depends on what happens in your
environment. You're sensitive to certain triggers.</p>

<p>Some triggers might happen early. There is some evidence that
schizophrenia is associated with trauma even at the point of birth. And
there's some other evidence that schizophrenia is linked to viral
infections. As an example, there are more schizophrenics born in the
winter, subtle--a subtle difference but there seems to be a reliable
effect of more schizophrenics born in the winter. More people get sick
in the winter. At times when there's been some sort of epidemic or some
sort of plague, this seems to cause a jump in the frequency of
schizophrenics born at that time.</p>

<p>There's some recent research that ties schizophrenia to the
possibility of toxoplasmosis, which is a disorder carried by cat feces.
The experiment basically involved asking the parents of schizophrenics
one question: "Did you own a cat when your child was born?" And if the
answer was "yes," it seemed to correspond to a bit higher odds for
schizophrenic families than for non-schizophrenic families.</p>

<p>A different sort of trigger is stressful family environments.
Schizophrenics seem to really have more stressful family environments
than non-schizophrenics. Now, we have to be careful about this. We have
to bring--we have to return to the sort of methodological cautions we
had in mind when we talked about individual difference research in
general. Remember we talked about the worst study in the world and one
of the features of this was it was failing to pull apart cause and
effect. It might be that having a difficult family environment ups your
odds of becoming schizophrenic. On the other hand, it might also be
that schizophrenic children or children who will become schizophrenic
are difficult to deal with in certain ways causing a family
environment. So, it's not clear whether the effect is from difficult
family environment to later schizophrenia or from schizophrenia to
difficult family environment.</p>

<p>There used to be a very popular theory of schizophrenia, which is
that it was caused by excess dopamine. Dopamine, you'll remember, is a
neurotransmitter. And there is some reason to take this seriously.
Drugs that reduce dopamine provide some help in reducing symptoms. And
if I give you a drug that shoots up your dopamine that will turn you
into a temporary schizophrenic. You get what's called "amphetamine
psychosis" and it'd give you--it can give you schizophrenic-like
symptoms, hallucinations, delusions, that sort of thing. This--There
might be something to this theory but we know now it can't be complete
for at least two reasons. First, it doesn't explain the negative
symptoms. It explains hallucinations and delusions and so on but it
doesn't explain the loss of affect, the quietness, the stillness. Also,
there seemed to be some sort of structural brain differences involving
enlarged cerebral ventricles, involving reduced frontal lobe activity,
suggesting that the problem with schizophrenia is a lot more
complicated than others might have it, than the dopamine theory would
have it.</p>

<p>I'll end with a mystery. And this mystery is discussed nicely in the
Gray textbook. The symptoms of schizophrenia, the prevalence of
schizophrenics, is similar wherever you go but less industrialized
countries have a better rate of recovery from schizophrenia than
industrialized countries. And nobody really knows why. I listed here
three possibilities. One is that the families that were--that--in a
less industrialized country there's more latitude and so there's less
critical- less criticism. There's less use of antipsychotic medication.
Antipsychotic medications help with the symptoms but they might also
impair recovery. And finally, if you think of schizophrenia as a
transient disorder, maybe that will in some sense, in some way, make
that more likely to actually happen.</p>

<p>The second sort of disorder I want to talk about, much more common
than the 1% that's schizophrenia, is the classic disorders known as
"anxiety disorders." The primary disturbance in anxiety disorders is
anxiety; you have a lot of anxiety. It's persistent, either anxiety or
maladaptive behaviors to reduce anxiety. Now, everybody experiences
anxiety. If you didn't experience anxiety, you'd be a very strange
person and you probably wouldn't function very well in the world, but
you have an anxiety disorder when you experience too much of it, it's
uncontrollable, it's unreasonable and it messes up your life. And
there's quite a few anxiety disorders. The simplest one is this
generalized anxiety disorders where--and this is about one in twenty
people will get it at some point in their lives and you worry all the
time. You're just very anxious. You're just worried all the time and it
could be paralyzing. It could give you physical symptoms like
headaches, stomachaches, muscle tension and irritability.</p>

<p>There is some evidence that generalized anxiety disorder has a
genetic component, that it's somehow related to major depression. And
it does seem to have its possible roots in some sort of childhood
trauma. And so the model some people give for this is when you are
young something really bad happens to you. This makes you
hyper-vigilant. You don't trust the world, bad things could always
happen around the corner. And because you're hyper-vigilant you are
more prone to develop generalized anxiety disorder after a difficult
life event.</p>

<p>A second sort of anxiety disorder, which we already discussed in
class are phobias and phobias are intense, irrational fears. They could
focus on objects, events, and social settings. Here's a nice diagram of
different phobia, different things, and their proportion of people who
are afraid of it. And the point of this diagram isn't with the details.
It's really--It's rather to give you a feeling for the fact that some
things most everybody is afraid of or a lot of people are afraid of and
some things not many at all. The big phobic object we know from
previous lectures is snakes. About 40% of the population say they're
afraid of snakes. How many people here are afraid of snakes? Okay. And
then there's a really terrifying thing, mice. How many people are
afraid of mice? Mice are the worst things in the world. [laughter] And
then cats and if you're afraid of cats that's really unusual. Not many
people are afraid of cats.</p>

<p>There is a classical conditioning model of phobias, which we are all
familiar with, but we are all familiar with why it is not a very good
theory. A lot of people who are afraid of snakes have never had a bad
experience with snakes. Moreover, a lot of people who have had bad
experiences with things like car crashes and being electrocuted on a
socket or a shooting, seeing a gun during a shooting, do not develop
phobias. This lead--gives rise to a much more plausible theory known as
the "preparedness theory," which says that we have evolved to be
sensitive to certain phobic objects, objects that were dangerous to us
in our evolutionary history. And we're prone to develop phobic
responses to this.</p>

<p>The final anxiety disorder is obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Obsessions are irrational disturbing thoughts that intrude into your
consciousness. This is--hits about two to three percent of the
population and it leads to compulsions, repetitive actions performed to
alleviate the obsessions. For instance, you might be obsessed with the
idea of being dirty, your hands are dirty, you're filthy. That might
lead to compulsive washing. You might believe that God is angry at you
and that might lead to compulsive prayer. Cleanliness and religion are
common themes of obsessive-compulsive disorder. You often know,
rationally, that these are unreasonable behaviors but you can't help
yourself from doing them. Sometimes I get the worry that I left my door
unlocked and I run back and checked it--check it. But I feel it's a
little bit of OCD coming on because I know I locked it, but did I
really lock it? And then you get--now I'm worried if I locked my
door.</p>

<p>Checking and washing. Checking is what I'm talking about here- most
common compulsions, and it seems to have a neuropsychological
phenomena. At least it's related to heightened neural activity in the
caudate nucleus. What's interesting is you might think
obsessive-compulsive disorder is a very sort of Freudian,
psychoanalytic sort of disorder but actually it's treated quite well
with drugs, drugs that affect the serotonin level. Serotonin, being a
neurotransmitter, can often do good work for obsessive-compulsive
disorders. So, if you develop a disorder, an OCD problem, you might
find yourself being cured simply with medications.</p>

<p>We've talked about schizophrenia and anxiety disorders. Any
questions or thoughts so far? Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What's the difference between OCD and Tourette's or
are they [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> It's a good question. The question was
the relationship between OCD and Tourette's. Tourette's is--I don't
know much about it but it's a very specific neurophysiological syndrome
that doesn't have--you don't have obsessive thoughts. What it leads to
is involuntary tics and tremors and sometimes sort of shouted
obscenities or taboo words. And it seems to be very specific to that
while OCD is much broader and involves both behaviors but also the
behaviors are in the service of thoughts. That's one way of thinking
about the difference. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Can individuals have multiple disorders like be
bipolar and schizophrenic?</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Yes. The question is can individuals
have multiple disorders? Absolutely, and in fact some disorders are
"comorbid." And that's just a fancy way of saying they often go
together. So, if you have a severe depression for instance, which is a
mood disorder, you may also have an anxiety disorder. So yes, having
one unfortunately doesn't immunize you against having another. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Where does superstition [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> The question was about superstitions. I
think--it's an interesting question which I have never thought of
before. I think it depends on the severity of superstitions. So, if you
just have a superstition saying "Step on a crack, break your mother's
back," which has never been scientifically proven, [laughter] but
suppose you--and then so you're just kind of "Oh, I kind of--I just
kind of--" or it's bad luck to break a mirror and that's it, you just
have it and it doesn't make a big deal to you, that's harmless. On the
other hand, if your superstition is such that you develop weird
rituals; you might have to carefully walk so you don't step on any
other--on any cracks or you might have to do--or if you do you might
have to go back and start your whole walk to work over again. When it
gets to that level it could creep into OCD. And often
obsessive-compulsive disorders have a religious or a magical
manifestation where you believe there are certain things you must do or
terrible things will happen and in that way you could view them as
extreme and build from superstitions, but simple superstitions don't
tend to be of that type. Yes, in back.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> The question is "are people with
schizophrenia dangerous?" As a rule statistically, it tends not to be
the case. They tend to be more likely victims than harmful. They tend
to be fairly helpless. You can have a case where a schizophrenic might
harm somebody. A paranoid schizophrenic, for instance, might develop a
delusion to harm somebody and so there are definitely such cases but
for the most part, again, they are more victims than oppressors.
They're more--they're very vulnerable because they aren't capable of
dealing with other people. They often aren't capable of defending
themselves. One more. Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> How permanent are the effects of the
medications?</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> The question is, "How permanent is the
effect of the medication?" Do you mean for schizophrenia?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Do they have to stay on the medication for
[inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Yes. In general, I think. I can't think
of any exceptions. The effects of medication are temporary. Now, that
doesn't mean if you have a bout of OCD or depression you have to be on
medication the rest of your life. What could happen is, for instance,
somebody--if you had a mild depression, go on something like Prozac or
Wellbutrin, use that time to kind of get your life back together, cheer
up a bit, and then when they go off the medication they are fine. But
as Professor Nolen-Hoeksema pointed out, unless they've developed
coping skills they're likely to relapse and get the problem again. So,
the physical effects of medication are always temporary, particularly
with anybody with schizophrenia, but they can often help people get out
of a problem, anxiety or depression.</p>

<p>Okay. Dissociative disorders. I'll show you a movie clip and then
we'll go back and talk a little bit about it. [clip playing]</p>

<p>Let me ask you a question that might seem somewhat uncaring. How
many of you think he's faking? How many of you [laughter] are confident
there are many people living inside his head as--in the way it's
depicted? Okay. How many of you are unsure? How many of you have two
minds? There is one part of you struggling-- [laughter] It's--let's
go--we'll go back to him.</p>

<p>Dissociative disorder are disorders involving dissociation. And what
people mean by that is literally a dissociation of memory; that is, you
become somehow unaware, separated from some part of your identity or
history and you're unable to recall those parts of your identity and
history except sometimes under special circumstances. Now, some degree
of dissociation is normal. There is--I will--I have here in, actually,
Dr. Nolen-Hoeksema's excellent abnormal psychology textbook a checklist
of dissociative experiences many of which normal people have: "Not sure
whether one has done something or only thought about it." Anybody ever
have that? Common. "So involved in the fantasy that it seems real."
[laughter] "Feeling as though one's body is not one's own." I will also
add that experiments with pharmaceuticals can often lead to
dissociative experiences. [laughter] "Driving a car and realizing that
one doesn't remember part of the trip. Talking out loud to oneself when
alone." Okay. "Not recognizing one's reflection in a mirror." Okay.
That's not very common [laughter] but it is--it's within the normal
range but then you get more severe cases and there is three different
types: dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, and dissociative
identity disorder.</p>

<p>Dissociative amnesia is illustrated in a story of a woman who sees
something terrible and as a result her memory of that experience was no
longer accessible. It's often known as "psychogenic amnesia." The only
thing wrong in here is you have memory loss. And sometimes it's a
selective memory loss but sometimes it could be global. It's as in
these movies cases where you lose your memory because something
terrible has happened and you would get it back later but you have a
temporary loss of identity. The idea is that something so terrible has
happened you separate yourself from your previous identity and your
memory. Over half of people charged with homicide claim to have some
degree of dissociative amnesia. The problem here is that many, many,
many of those cases involve alcohol and drugs, which can lead to some
sort of alcoholic blackout. Also, people could be lying. If you're
charged with murder, it's often a reasonable thing to say, "I don't
remember any of this," to just kind of--and--as a way to distance
yourself from it.</p>

<p>Dissociative fugue is kind of weird and interesting. The guy's wife
leaves him for another man. Six months later he was discovered tending
bar in Miami Beach and calling himself Martin. And he totally wiped out
his past memory and developed a new identity. This is also known as
"psychogenic fugue." So, it's global amnesia but there's also identity
replacement. You leave home, you develop a new identity, and it's
called a fugue state. This is my favorite mental disorder. If I had to
get a serious mental disorder, I would get this because I'd get to
travel. When it wears off your old identity comes back and your new
identity is forgotten.</p>

<p>Then there's dissociative identity disorder and this is a story of
this woman who goes back and forth from her regular personality to a
personality of Donna who is only six years old. This was originally
known as ""multiple personality disorder" and the idea is you have two
or more distinct people in one head. It is--there are--It is a rare and
controversial disorder but it includes some very famous cases and has
been illustrated in many movies and books including the wonderful movie
<em>Primal Fear</em> where--Ed Norton's first big movie, highly
recommend it. And it's been tried as a criminal defense. The Hillside
Strangler claimed to be two people but he was still convicted, both of
them. It typically starts early, the pattern of dissociation. Mostly
it's women. And mostly, it involves some sort of recollection of
torture or sexual abuse. Also, and to get back to your question, can
you have more than one mental disorder at the same time, people with
dissociative disorder often show symptoms of posttraumatic stress
disorder or PTSD.</p>

<p>What causes it? Well, it is often argued to be the cause--caused by
severe abuse, often sexual or physical abuse. The problem is most
people who get abused don't develop dissociative identity disorder. And
one idea is that it's abuse plus some sort of genetic or biological
predisposition to dissociate and in fact, people with dissociative
identity disorder seem to be very susceptible. They're easier to
hypnotize than other people. And so it might begin as sort of a
self--an act of self-hypnosis. You put yourself in a hypnotic trance to
cope with some terrible situation and you begin to develop new and
separate and distinct personalities.</p>

<p>Now, of the many things I'm going to talk to you, I've
talked--spoken about, some have been very controversial. One issue of
controversy which we talked about was the existence in nature of
so-called "repressed memories." This is another very controversial case
related to the repressed memory case. In a recent poll, less than one
quarter of psychiatrists believe there is such a thing as dissociative
identity disorder. Why would you doubt that? Well, there are some
curious statistics. Between 1930 and 1960, there were two cases in the
United States. In the 1980s, there were 20,000 cases. You cannot go
elsewhere from the United States and find people with dissociative
identity disorder. It seems to be an American phenomena. And it varies
by therapists. Some therapists, indeed some hospitals, some medical
units go decades without ever seeing anybody that approaches
dissociative identity disorder. Other therapists, virtually every
patient they have has multiple personalities.</p>

<p>One worry based on these facts is dissociative identity disorder is
in a sense real, that Richard really does believe he's moving from
personality to personality but he didn't come in to therapy with that
problem. Rather, his therapist gave it to him. The claim is that it's
the result of suggestion by the therapist. The therapists, and they're
typically good people who wish to help, but the therapists might be in
the grips of a theory involving repression and multiple personalities
and different selves and encourage, either tacitly or overtly, their
patients to develop these separate personalities.</p>

<p>Related to this, it's not clear to what extent dissociative identity
disorder is an extreme version of normal psychopathology--sorry, of
normal psychology. So people, from the philosopher Dan Dennett to the
psychologist Judith Harris, have pointed out that we're different
selves in different situations. We can consciously play act the
different selves but we could also just shift personalities depending
on whether we're with our friends or our family or with strangers. The
claim is that dissociative identity disorder, however dramatic it
looks, might merely be an extended version of this where people as well
are to some extent play acting to make their therapists and doctors
happy. Any questions about dissociative identity disorder? Yes.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Yes. Dissociative amnesia--the question
involves the relationship between dissociative amnesia and the
retrograde and anterograde amnesia discussed before. Those other
amnesias are the result of brain damage. They tend to be if not
permanent long lasting and severe. Dissociative amnesia is apparently
caused by specific life events and can often be very short-lived.
They're, of course, all brain events but in the crude sense the
dissociative amnesia is more of a psychological happening than the
other sorts of amnesias that we talked about involving Korsakoff
syndrome and the patient "HM" and so on. Other questions. Yes, in
back.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom:</b> Yes. What happened in 1960--There was a
very famous case. I think the case was the case of Sybil. Does anybody
know? The teaching fellows are nodding but there was a very famous case
which I think was of Sybil which was made into a movie and discussed
and had a huge influence on people and then they started to believe
that it was real.</p>

<p>There is a type--The fourth and final type of disorder is something
which is not actually discussed in the Gray textbook but it has to do
with personality and this is interesting because it probably extends to
some extent to many of these people--the people in this room.
Personality, as you remember, is your way of dealing with the world, in
particular the way you have of dealing with other people. The notion of
personality disorders is that some personalities are so bad that they
veer off into mental illness so one personality disorder is a
narcissistic personality disorder. Everyone likes to talk about
themselves and thinks they're terrific to some extent, some people to a
little bit too much, but if it's really extreme they could
talk--they--you could get labeled with a narcissistic personality
disorder. You might have an avoidant personality disorder, dependent,
histrionic, borderline. Borderline is really bad. When people describe
you as a borderline personality disorder, that just means you're just
awful to be with, you're kind of awful. [laughter] There is the
paranoid personality disorder which is not that you're paranoid
schizophrenic, very clearly no signs of schizophrenia, no
hallucinations, nothing like that. You are just paranoid. You're
just--to a greater extent than normal, you think other people are
against you and plotting against you.</p>

<p>The most interesting personality disorders in my mind have to do
with violence and crime and they have to do in particular with
something called "antisocial personality disorder." Now, most murderers
are not mentally ill in a medical sense. They're not mentally ill
according to how clinicians categorize things. To some extent, most
people who kill are just normal people being driven by normal desires,
rage, jealousy, hate, just taken to an extreme. Even mass murderers do
not as a rule appear to be substantively different from a psychological
point of view. In every society--and honestly, I wrote the lecture on
this quite a while ago but, given the recent events, they stand as a
perfectly good example of what I'm going to say. In every society there
is a notion of somebody who has been deeply humiliated, usually male,
and he's been humiliated over and over again. He sees himself as losing
status and losing status and losing status and he tries to get it all
back, to gain face with one act of terrible violence where he takes his
revenge over everybody and then is known as--and as a result, even
though he might die, he probably will die, makes his way to a level of
social status he would have never gotten before. The American term for
this used to be "going postal" and--but this is an old idea. Stone Age
tribes in Papua, New Guinea, had a term for this. They call it "running
amok" and this is--and every society has this.</p>

<p>So, there's normal murderers, there's mass murderers, and then
there's the interesting cases like serial killers like Dahmer or Son of
Sam, Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, even the imaginary Hannibal Lecter.
Many of these sort of serial killers do have some sort of mental
illness but the mental illnesses are all over the place. There was a
guy, Jerome Brudos, who had such a severe fetish for women's feet that
he killed young women and severed their feet and then kept their feet
around his house. Son of Sam was pretty clearly a paranoid
schizophrenic. He did his murders because a barking dog told him to.
Jeffrey Dahmer is a cannibal killer and he killed people so he could
eat them and then--and I asked one of my colleagues in
clinical--colleagues what exactly was wrong with him and the person
immediately responded, "He has a severe eating disorder." [laughter]
So, it's--it was a joke. It was in very, very bad taste. [laughter] A
lot of [laughter] murderers claim to have dissociative disorders, "it
wasn't me who killed the guy, it was my alter ego, Fred." It's not
clear how often they're telling the truth, if ever or whether this is a
way of escaping responsibility.</p>

<p>There is a mental illness--There's an extreme, specific version of a
personality disorder that revolves around violence, and this is known
as "antisocial personality disorder." It is--it used to be called moral
insanity. Now it's often called psychopathy. Some people make a
distinction between psychopath and sociopath. For the purposes here
others don't, and for the purposes here I'm going to blend them into
one category. Then I'll use the term "psychopath." They're typically
male. They are defined as selfish, callous, impulsive, they're sexually
promiscuous. They seem to lack love, loyalty, normal feelings of
affiliation and compassion, and they get into all sorts of trouble
because they're easily bored and they seek out stimulation. Now, when
you hear this, you've got to realize that this sort of person is not
necessarily an unattractive person to imagine or think about or even
under some circumstances to encounter. You have to avoid the temptation
when you think about psychopath to think about a guy like this, to
think about Hannibal Lecter. The most famous psychopath, of course, is
James Bond who is a perfect psychopath in every regard as played by him
also by Sean Connery. The Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton characters
were not psychopaths. I could give a whole course on that.</p>

<p>Is this an illness? Well, again, this is one of the hard cases.
Psychopaths don't come in for treatment. James Bond would never go to a
therapist and say, "I have a problem with promiscuity and my life of
adventure. [laughter] Why is it that I don't have this need to settle
down and have kids and be a one-woman man?" They don't have a problem
with it. Other people often have a problem with it but it's not clear
that's enough to make it a mental disorder. Also, a lot of psychopaths
are reasonably successful. Now, this gets complicated because
psychologists study psychopaths but the psychopaths that they study are
by definition unsuccessful psychopaths. And what some people have
argued is the real psychopaths, the successful ones, are the ones that
run the world, that excel in every field because they are successful
enough that they don't look like psychopaths. They have no conscience,
no compassion, love, loyalty. They are cold-blooded and ambitious but
they don't go around making this so obvious that we throw them in
prison. And so, it's an interesting and subtle and complicated
case.</p>

<p>The final section – and I'll start this and we'll go five minutes
into this and then move--continue it next week with the final class –
concerns therapy. Now, the most interesting thing for us to deal with
is the question of, "Does therapy work?" And there's a lot to be said
about this. The history of therapy has been gruesome and unsuccessful.
Again, to be mad was to be viewed as to be in league with the devil and
so people with mental illnesses were tortured to death, burnt, sent out
to sea and so on. In the eighteenth century they were thought of as
degenerates and sent away from society. In the nineteenth century there
was a brief blast of compassion where Pinel tried to have mental
hospitals and then there were all sorts of--since then all sorts of
medical treatments that were considerably less successful and this
brief video will summarize some of the previous medical treatments.

<p>I often wonder a hundred years from now how they're going to look at
our current therapies and then whether they'll see them as equally
barbaric and stupid as we look at the therapies in the past. What I'll
begin next lecture with is a very quick discussion of what therapies
work of the ones currently available and then I'll end the class. And
this will be a somewhat short class. I'll end the class with a
discussion of happiness. There is an optional thing I'll add, which is
your reading responses are done and you'll have the opportunity to make
comments on the class in anonymous evaluations but what I'm kind of
interested in is if people could send me an e-mail, and this is
entirely optional, about the most interesting thing that we've covered
in this class. I'm curious what people think it is and it's something
which I could try to build up on for future classes. So, again, this is
optional. Just give it a subject heading "Intro Psych" and send it to
me if you choose to do it and I'll see you on Wednesday.</p>
