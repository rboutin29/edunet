<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: This is going to begin a two-lecture
sequence on social psychology on how we think about ourselves, how we
think about other people, how we think about other groups of people.
We've talked a lot about the capacities of the human mind and some of
these capacities involve adapting and dealing with the material world.
So, we have to choose foods, we have to navigate around the world, we
have to recognize objects, we have to be able to understand physical
interactions. But probably the most interesting aspect of our evolved
minds is our capacity to understand and deal with other people.</p>

<p>We are intensely interested in how other people work. The story that
was a dominant news story in 2005 was this. And some of you--this--for
those of you who aren't seeing the screen, is the separation of
Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt. I remember where I was when I first
heard about this. [laughter] And it's an interesting sight. Just
remember--stepping back. As psychologists we have to question the
natural. We have to take things that are commonsense and explore them.
And one thing which just happens is, we're fascinated by this stuff.
We're fascinated by the lives of celebrities. We're fascinated by the
social lives of other people. And it's an interesting question to ask
why. And this is one of the questions which I'm going to deal with in
the next couple of lectures but before I get to the theory of social
psychology I want to talk about an individual difference.</p>

<p>So, we devoted a lecture early on--of a couple of weeks ago, to
individual differences across people in intelligence and personality. I
want to talk a little bit about an individual difference in our social
natures and then I want people to do a test that will explore where you
stand on a continuum. That test is the piece of paper you have in front
of you. Anybody who doesn't have it please raise your hand and one of
the teaching fellows will bring it to you. You don't know what to do
yet with it so don't worry. The test was developed actually by Malcolm
Gladwell who is a science writer--in his wonderful book <i>The Tipping
Point.</i> And as he introduces the test, Gladwell recounts another
experiment done by Stanley Milgram, of course famous for his obedience
work but he did a lot of interesting things.</p>

<p>And one classic study he did was he gave a package to 160 people
randomly chosen in Omaha, Nebraska and he asked these people to get the
package somehow – and this was many years ago before the internet,
before e-mail – to get the package to a stockbroker who worked in
Boston but lived in Sharon, Massachusetts. What he found was that most
people were able to do it. Nobody, of course, knew this man but they
knew people who might know people who would know this man. So, most
people succeeded. Most people were able to get the packages to this man
and it took at maximum six degrees of separation, which is where the
famous phrase comes about that we're all separated from another person
by six degrees of separation. This is not true in general. This was a
very--a single experiment done within the United States, but the idea
is appealing, that people are connected to one another via chains of
people.</p>

<p>But what Milgram found that was particularly interesting was that in
about half of the cases these packages went through two people. That
is, if you plot the relationships between people--We can take each
person in this room, find everybody you know and who knows you and draw
a line, but if we were to do this you wouldn't find an even mesh of
wires. Rather, you'd find that some people are clusters. Some people
are what Gladwell calls "connectors." It's like air traffic. Air
traffic used to be everything flew to places local to it but now
there's a system of hubs, Chicago O'Hare for instance or Newark where
planes fly through. Some people are hubs. Some people are the sort of
people who know a lot of people. Some people in this room might be
hubs, and it is not impossible to find out.</p>

<p>The piece of paper you have here is 250 names chosen randomly from a
Manhattan phone book. They capture a range of ethnicities, different
parts of the world, different national origins. Here's what I'd like
you to do. And I'll give about five minutes for this. Go through these
names and circle how many people you know. Now, the rules of this are,
to know somebody you have to--they have to know you back. So, if it's a
celebrity--Well, here--one of the names here is Johnson. Now, I've
heard of Magic Johnson but Magic Johnson has never heard of me, so I
cannot circle it. On the other hand, our department chair is Marcia
Johnson. She has heard of me, so I could circle it. Go through and
circle it. Circle all the people you know who know you. Those are the
people you're connected to. If you know more than one person with the
same last name, circle it twice. If you don't have this piece of paper
and you want to participate, please raise your hand and one of the
teaching fellows will bring it to you. I'm going to talk a little bit
more about this while people go through this.</p>

<p>The issue of connections between people is intellectually
interesting for many reasons and might allow us to develop some
generalizations about how people interact. The game of Six Degrees of
Separation has, of course, turned into a famous movie trivia thing
revolving around the actor Kevin Bacon, I think chosen just because it
rhymes with "separation." And the game of "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"
is played by taking any actor and computing how many steps it would
take to get to Kevin Bacon. And some computer scientists have developed
this. They've gone through each of the quarter million actors and
actresses on the international movie database and computed their "Bacon
number." And the Bacon number is the number of steps it takes for them
to get to Kevin Bacon. So for instance, Ed Asner was in the movie
Change of--;"JFK" with Kevin Bacon. So, Ed Asner has a Bacon number of
one. Elvis Presley was in the movie "Change of Habit" with Ed Asner and
that's his closest connection to Kevin Bacon. So, Elvis Presley has a
Bacon number of two.</p>

<p>It turns out that if you look at the 2.5--sorry, the quarter million
people on the movie database and compute their Bacon number, the
average Bacon number is 2.8. That's how many steps your average person
is away from Kevin Bacon. You could then, for any actor or actress,
compute the most connected one. So, the most connected one would be the
one for whom the quarter million are, on average, the most connected
to. And the answer of the most connected actor or actress is reasonably
surprising. Does anybody want to guess? I'll start you off with the
wrong answer and this, by the way, can be found on this web site. It's
not John Wayne. John Wayne has been in many movies, 180 movies, in
fact, over sixty years, but he isn't well connected at all because
mostly he was in westerns so we saw the same people over and over
again. Meryl Streep also isn't it because Meryl Streep has the
misfortune of playing only in good movies. [laughter] So, she has no
connection with people like Adam Sandler and John-Claude Van Damme.
[laughter] Guess. Any guesses?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Christopher Walken</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Nicholas Cage</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: Christopher Walken is a good one. We
could look it up. I only know a few names here. Christopher Walken is
not a finalist. Nicolas Cage is an interesting case. Has Nicolas Cage
been in good movies? I don't want to get--I'm going to get more
controversial than I want to.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: A guy who is one step above an extra. He's like a
B-list actor at best.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: Pardon me? The most connected guy? The
most connected guy, and I think this shows that you're right, is Rod
Steiger. He's the most connected actor in the history of acting because
it isn't that he's been in more movies than everybody else. Michael
Caine has probably been in the most movies of any person on earth, but
he's [Rod Steiger] been in all sorts of movies. He was in "On the
Waterfront," "In the Heat of the Night," and really bad movies like
"Carpool." He's been in dramas and crime serials, thrillers, westerns,
horror movies, science fiction, musicals. Now, some people are like Rod
Steiger. So, some people in their day-to-day lives have many
interactions and I think one of the things we know from interacting
with people is we can distinguish them from other people.</p>

<p>How many people have finished their things right now? Okay. I know
one person in the department who is one of the most connected people I
know on earth. If I wanted--If I really had to talk to Rumsfeld, I'd go
to this person and say, "Can you get me in touch with Rumsfeld?" If I
wanted to get somebody whacked, I'd ask this guy. [laughter] Then I
know someone else in the department and, as best I know, I'm the only
person she knows. [laughter]</p>

<p>So, how many people scores below ten on this? How many between ten
and twenty? Between twenty and thirty? Thirty and forty? Between forty
and fifty? Fifty and sixty? How many people scored above sixty? Anybody
above sixty? Gladwell has done this in a lot of places. The average is
twenty-one among a college crowd. Some people score as high as over
100. The older you are, the more--the higher you tend to score, maybe
obviously, not--the longer you've been in the country the higher you
tend to score. Journalists tend to score reasonably high, academics not
so high, and--but what Gladwell points out is some people have the
gift. Some people are more social than others and this connects in all
sorts of interesting ways.</p>

<p>The issue of connection has social factors and it's one answer that
sociologists give for why it's good to go to Yale. So, one answer is,
well, because of the great intellectual benefits. Put that aside. Let's
be more cynical here. Another answer is that you develop powerful
friends. And that's closer, but the interesting answer sociologists
come to is it's not so much you develop powerful friends; rather, you
develop powerful acquaintances. Through Yale you know a lot of people
and they don't have to be close friends but they are acquaintances. And
sociologists point out that for a lot of aspects of your life, like
getting a job, acquaintances matter, connections matter, and the
connections you establish by going to a place like Yale hold you in
good stead for the rest of your life, above and beyond any intellectual
qualities that this place may offer.</p>

<p>Here's what we're going to do for the next lecture and a half, two
lectures. We're first going to talk about the self. Then we're going to
talk about the self and other; basically, differences between how we
think of ourselves and how we think about other people. Then we're
going to talk exclusively about how we think about other people and
then we'll talk about how we think about groups like Harvard students
or gay people or black people. I'll start with my favorite finding of
all time and this is about the self. And this is about the spotlight
effect.</p>

<p>So, my mornings are often rushed because I have two kids. So, I get
up and sometimes I don't set the alarm and I get up late; I stagger out
of bed; I wake the kids; I greet the servants; I get ready; [laughter]
I make breakfast. I run out of the house and then usually around 3
o'clock somebody points out, in one case a homeless man, that I have a
big glob of shaving cream in my ear or--because I neglected to actually
look in the mirror while I shaved. Or I have once been to a party and I
found my shirt was misaligned, seriously misaligned, not one button
but--Anyway, [laughter] so--and so I feel when this happens I'm very
immature. And I basically feel this is the end of the world, this is
humiliating and everybody notices. And so the question is, how many
people notice when something happens? And the spotlight effect--Well,
before talking about my favorite experiment ever, there is an episode
of "The Simpsons" that provides a beautiful illustration of the
spotlight effect. And then it has a beautiful illustration of
psychological testing, so I'll give you them quickly one after the
other. [clip playing]</p>

<p>So, Tom Gilovich, a social psychologist, was interested in the
question of the spotlight effect, which is when we wear a pink shirt to
work, shaving cream in our ear or whatever, do we systematically
overestimate how much other people notice? He did a series of
experiments. And in one experiment what he did was he got in the
subjects – standard Intro Psych drill – and said, "I want you to wear a
T-shirt for the next day and I want it to have a picture on it," and he
got them to wear T-shirts that had pictures on it that were the most
embarrassing pictures that they could have on it. It turns out that if
you ask people what's the worst picture to have on the T-shirt that you
are wearing, the number one answer is Hitler tied with Barry Manilow.
[laughter] The best pictures to have on your T-shirt are Martin Luther
King Jr. and Jerry Seinfeld.</p>

<p>It turns out that people--And then he had them go about their day
and asked them, "How many people noticed your T-shirt?" And then the
psychologists went around and they asked the people, "How many of you
noticed this person's T-shirt?" And it turned out they got it wrong by
a factor of about two. They thought, say, 100 noticed, but fifty people
noticed. And across study after study after study Gilovich and his
colleagues have found support for the spotlight effect, which is that
you believe that people are noticing you all the time but they aren't.
They're busy noticing themselves. And this is actually a useful thing
to know.</p>

<p>Gilovich got interested in this because he's interested in the
psychology of regret. And it turns out that if you actually ask dying
people, or really old people basically, "What do you regret from your
life?" they regret the things as a rule that they didn't try. But when
you asked them why they didn't try it the answers tended to be "I would
look silly." And it turns out, interesting to know, that people just
don't care as much as other people think you are. You could take that
as good news or bad news but the spotlight is not on us as much as we
think it is.</p>

<p>There's a second effect Gilovich discovers called "the transparency
effect." And the transparency effect is quite interesting. The
transparency effect is that we believe that we're more transparent than
we are. I need somebody up here who thinks that he or she is a bad
liar. Just--I just need you to say three sentences. I'll even tell you
what it is ahead of time. I'm going to ask you three questions: "Have
you been in London? Do you have a younger sibling?" and "Do you like
sushi?" I want you to answer with one of those answers there. I want
you to lie about one of them. The task will be for everybody else to
recognize and guess which one you're lying about. Do you want to go up?
Yeah. And I will even write down which one you should lie on. So, I
want you to lie as to that number. Okay? Have you ever been in
London?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: No, I have not been in London.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: Do you have a younger sibling?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Yes, I have a younger sibling.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: Do you like sushi?</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: No, I do not like sushi.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: Okay. Let's have a vote. She was lying
about one of them. Who votes for one? Who votes for two? Who votes for
three? Pretty much of a tie between two and three. You could say which
one you were lying.</p>

<p><b>Student</b>: Three.</p>

<p><b>Professor Paul Bloom</b>: The effect--there are two aspects of
the effect. One aspect is people are actually quite good at lying. It
is a rare person who couldn't stand up there and everybody would figure
out what they're lying about, but the transparency effect is we don't
feel that way. We often feel like things bleed out of us and so people
will systematically overestimate the extent to which other people
notice their secrets. And this is actually, in general, why it's
sometimes difficult to teach or to tell stories because we constantly
overestimate how much other people know. We think of ourselves as more
transparent than we are.</p>

<p>A second social psychological phenomena is you think you're
terrific. If I asked people, "How well are you doing in Intro Psych
this semester?" and I asked you to give yourself a percentage rating
relative to the rest of the class, then if everybody was accurate, or
at least not systematically biased, the number should add up to 50%.
Roughly half of you are doing better than average and roughly half of
you are doing worse than average. It turns out though that people will
systematically and dramatically view themselves as better than average.
They will view themselves as better than average when asked how good
they are as a student, as a teacher, as a lover, and particularly, as a
driver. [laughter] Everybody who drives thinks that he or she is a
wonderful driver.</p>

<p>This has been called the "Lake Wobegon effect" based on Garrison
Keillor's story about a place where all the children are above average.
And the Lake Wobegon effect in psychology involves a systematic bias to
see ourselves as better than average. What psychologists don't really
know is why the Lake Wobegon effect exists, and there are a couple of
proposals. One is the nature of the feedback we get. So, for a lot of
aspects of your life you only get feedback when you're good, when you
do something good. In a normal, productive, healthy, happy environment,
people don't scream at you about how bad you're doing but they
compliment how good you are and that could lead to an inflated
self-esteem on the part of people in certain domains.</p>

<p>Another possibility is there's different criteria for goodness. For
a driver, for instance, when I ask you to rank how good you are as a
driver, what people often do is they think--they say, "I'm better than
average," but what they do is they focus on one aspect of their
driving. So, some of you might say, "Hey, I'm just a great parallel
parker so I'm a great driver." Others might say, "I'm very careful,
great driver." Others might say, "I take chances no one else
will--great driver," [laughter] but above and beyond that there does
seem to be a psychological effect manifested here and manifested
elsewhere, which is a motivation to feel good about yourself. You think
you're important, which is why the spotlight effect exists. You think
your thoughts bleed out, which is why the transparency effect exists.
But above and beyond that, in a normal, healthy mind you think you're
terrific.</p>

<p>And so, this shows up in all sorts of ways. It shows up as well in
what's been called "the self-serving bias." Half of you did above
average on the Midterm; half of you did below average on the Midterm,
but if I went up and asked each of you why the answers would not be
symmetrical. People who did well in the Midterm would describe it in
terms of their capacities or abilities. They'd say, "It's because I'm
smart, hardworking, brilliant." People who did poorly would say, "The
Midterm was unfair. I was busy. I have better things to do with my
time." Professors as well--When people get papers accepted it is
because the papers are brilliant. When they got them rejected it's
because there's a conspiracy against them by jealous editors and
reviewers. There is this asymmetry all the time. The asymmetry has been
found in athletes, in CEOs and in accident reports. And again, this is
sort of a positive enhancement technique. You think that you're
terrific and because you're terrific the good things that happen to you
are due to your terrific-ness; the bad things are due to accident and
misfortune.</p>

<p>The final aspect of self that I want to talk about is the idea that
what you do makes sense. And this is one of the more interesting sub
domains of social psychology. The idea was developed by the social
psychologist Leon Festinger and it's called "Cognitive Dissonance
Theory." And what Festinger was interested in was the idea that what
happens when people experience an inconsistency in their heads. And he
claimed it causes an unpleasant emotional state, what he described as
"dissonance." And he argued that we act so as to reduce dissonance.
When there's a contradiction in our heads we're not happy and will take
steps to make the contradiction go away.</p>

<p>This all sounds very general but there are some striking
demonstrations of this and how it could work in everyday life. So, this
very simple example is that--is the confirmation bias. Some of you are
politically right wing. Some of you are politically left wing. If I
asked you what magazines you read, it turns out people who are right
wing read right wing magazines, people who are left wing read left wing
magazines, because people don't as a rule enjoy getting information
that disconfirms what they believe in. They want to have information
that confirms what they believe in and that supports it. If you support
Bush you're going to be looking for good news about Bush, if you don't
support him you'll be looking for bad news.</p>

<p>And this manifests itself in all sorts of interesting ways. I'll
tell you about a very simple experiment. I'll--It was done by Louisa
Egan here at Yale and it illustrates a point which is going
to--which--and then I'll talk about real world implications of this.
Very simple. You have three M&amp;Ms. You pretest to make sure that the
person doesn't like any M&amp;M more than the other. And there are
three M&amp;Ms. Who cares? But then you ask them to choose between two
of them. So, suppose they choose the red one. You've got to choose one.
So, they get to eat the red one. Now, they're offered--You take the red
one away and now they're offered a choice between the two remaining
ones. It turns out, to a tremendous degree, and you could imagine
yourself in that situation, they choose this one, the one that wasn't
the one they turned down. And the claim is that when you choose this,
in order to justify your decision, you denigrate the one you didn't
choose. And so this one you didn't choose is then tainted and you turn
and then when compared to a third one you favor that third one. What's
particularly interesting is you get this effect easily with
undergraduates but you also get it with four-year-olds and with
monkeys. So, the same denigration tends to be more general.</p>

<p>Well, that's a laboratory effect but there are some more interesting
manifestations of cognitive dissonance. One is the insufficient
justification effect, which is so famous it had a cartoon based on it.
The guys says, "Why should I hire you as my consultant?" The dog--Some
dog says, "I use my special--the special process of cognitive
dissonance to improve employee morale." "How does it work?" "Well, when
people are in an absurd situation their minds rationalize it by
inventing a comfortable illusion." Not quite right. When people
are--have an internal conflict, when there's something
uncomfortable--Well, that's right. So says to this person, "Isn't it
strange you have this dead-end job when you're twice as smart as your
boss? The hours are long, the pay is mediocre, nobody respects your
contribution, yet you freely choose to work here. It's absurd. No.
Wait. There must be a reason. I must work here because I love this
work, I love this job." [laughter]</p>

<p>This actually works. Here is the classic experiment by Festinger.
Gave two groups of people a really boring task, paid one of them twenty
dollars, which back when this study was done was real money, gave
another group of subjects one dollar, which was insultingly small, then
asked them later, "What do you think of the task?" It turns out that
the group that had--were paid a dollar rated the task as much more fun
than the group given twenty dollars. So, think about that for a moment.
You might have predicted it the other way around, the twenty dollars,
"wow, well, twenty dollars, I must have enjoyed it because I got twenty
dollars," but in fact, the logic here is the people with twenty dollars
when asked, "What do you think of the task?" could say, "It was boring.
I did it for twenty dollars." The people paid one dollar were like the
character in the <i>Dilbert</i> cartoon. When paid a dollar they said,
"Well, I don't want to be a donkey. I don't want to be some guy who
does this boring thing for a dollar. It wasn't that bad really, it was
kind of interesting, I learnt a lot," to justify what they did.</p>

<p>This has a lot of real world implications. Festinger did a wonderful
study with people--a group of people, and he wrote this up in a book
called <i>When Prophesy Fails,</i> who were convinced that the world
was going to end so they went on a mountain and they waited for the
world to end. They had a certain time and date when the world was going
to end. He hung out with them and then the time passed and the world
didn't end. What people then said, and this is what he was interested
in--;So, people's predictions were totally proven wrong and they left
their families, they gave away their houses, they gave away all their
possessions, they lost all their money, but what Festinger found was
they didn't say, "God, I'm such a moron." Rather, they said, "This is
fantastic. This is exactly--This shows that us going to the mountain
has delayed the ending of the world and this shows that we're doing
exactly the right things. I couldn't have been smarter." And in
general, when people devote a lot of energy or money or expense to
something, they are extraordinarily resistant to having it proven
wrong.</p>

<p>Now, people have manipulated cognitive dissonance in all sorts of
ways and, for instance, hazing. Hazing is cognitive dissonance at work.
Fraternities and med schools and other organizations haze people. What
they do is when people enter the group they humiliate them, they cause
them pain, they cause them various forms of torture and unpleasantness.
Why? Well, because it's very successful at getting somebody to like the
group. If I join a fraternity--it is also by the way illegal so – but
if I were to join a fraternity and they say, "Welcome to the
fraternity, Dr. Bloom. Here. Have a mint," and then we have a good time
and everything. I'm thinking "okay, sounds like a fun idea." But if I
join a fraternity and they pour cow poop on my head and make me stand
in the rain for a month wearing pantyhose while they throw rocks at me
[laughter] I then think--after it I think "God, I went through a lot of
stuff to get into this fraternity. It must be really good." And in
fact, hazing through cognitive dissonance draws the inference that this
is really, really valuable and this is why it exists.</p>

<p>If you are a political--If you are running for office, you will tend
to have volunteers and not necessarily pay people. One reason for this
is obvious; it's cheaper not to pay people, but the other reason is
more interesting. If you don't pay people, they are more committed to
the cause. Again, it's cognitive dissonance. If you pay me ten thousand
dollars a month to work for you, I'll work for you and I'll think "I'm
doing it for ten thousand dollars a month, that makes a lot of sense,"
but if I do it for nothing then I have to ask myself, "Why am I doing
it?" And I will conclude I must think very highly of you.</p>

<p>Therapy for free tends to be useless therapy. This is one-- [laughs]
Therapists ask for money for all sorts of reasons, including they like
money. But one reason why they ask for money is if you don't pay for
therapy you don't think it has any value. You have to give up
something. So, cognitive dissonance will lead you then to think that
what you are giving it up for has some value and then you establish a
liking for it.</p>

<p>Finally, cognitive dissonance shows up with children. One of the
most robust and replicated findings in education or developmental
psychology is very simple. You take two groups of kids and you ask them
to do something like draw pictures. Half of the kids you reward. Maybe
you give them a sticker or a toy. The other half you don't reward. Now,
according to sort of a simple-minded view of operant conditioning in
behaviorist psychology, the children you reward should do it more.
That's how operative conditioning works. In fact though, the children
who you reward later on think that this activity has less value and
they are less likely to do it when there's no reward present. And the
idea, again, is the kids who don't get rewarded say to themselves,
"Well, I just spent time doing it, it must have an intrinsic value,"
while the children who get rewarded say, "I did it for the sticker. I
did it for the toy. I don't care much for this." And so, rewarding
children has a danger, which is if you give them too much reward and
too much a value for what they're doing they will denigrate the
activity.</p>

<p>Now, we need to be careful here about what's going on. It's not
simple inconsistency. So, go back to this insufficient justification
effect. So, the dollar group rated a task as more fun than the twenty
dollar group. And it's true; each group needed a justification for
lying about the task. Each group needed a justification for saying how
interesting the task was, but they each had a justification. They were
each doing it for money after all. So, cognitive dissonance is a little
bit more subtle. It's not just that there's a clash. Rather, we adjust
our beliefs to make ourselves look more moral and rational than we are.
Go back to hazing. There's a perfectly good reason why I let them do
all those things to me. I'm the sort of person who will let people do
those things to me. The problem is that's not an answer I could live
with. So, cognitive dissonance motivates me to create an answer that's
more comfortable for me, an answer such as "This must be a really
wonderful group with a wonderful bunch of people." And in other words,
we are biased to believe that we are terrific.</p>

<p>So, to sum up, there are three main findings about you that come out
in social psychology. One is you believe everybody notices you even
when they don't. You're the hero of your story. The second one is,
you're terrific, you are better than average in every possible way,
each one of you. And finally, what you do makes sense. If it doesn't
make sense, you'll--If it doesn't make sense or, more to the point, if
it's something that you do that's foolish or makes you look
manipulative or cheap, you'll distort it in your head so that it does
make sense.</p>

<p>I want to move now to how we think about self and other, how we
think about ourselves relative to how we think about other people. And
this brings us to the notion of attribution. So, an attribution is a
claim about the cause of somebody's behavior and Heider--;Now, there's
all sorts of reasons for somebody's behavior. Suppose you insult me or
suppose you're very kind to me. I could say you're a kind person or
you're a rude person. I could say "this must be a great day for you" or
"you must be a lot of--under a lot of stress or you must want
something." There's different sorts of attributions we could make to
people but Heider's insight is we tend to attribute other people's
actions to their personality characteristics, to long-standing aspects
of what they are. And this is known as a person bias. And more
generally, people tend to give too much weight to the person and not
enough weight to the situation. This is also sometimes known as the
fundamental attribution error. The fundamental attribution error, which
is one of the core ideas in psychology, is that we tend to
over-attribute things to a person's personality or desires or nature
and not enough to the situation or the context.</p>

<p>There's a lot of demonstrations of this. A lot of the demonstrations
have to do with intelligence so, for example, there's actually been
studies showing that people tend to overestimate the intelligence of
professors. Why? Because I stand up here and I talk about the one or
more than one thing I know about and so it's easy to infer that I must
know a lot but in fact by the time this semester ends I will have tell
you--told you everything I know. [laughter] And if you stood up and
started talking about everything you knew you'd look really smart
too.</p>

<p>The best study to show this is a quiz show study, which is you take
two people and you flip a coin. And one of them is the quiz master and
the quiz master gets to ask questions, any question he or she wants.
And the other person has to answer the questions. And if they play
seriously, the quiz master's going to destroy the other person. "What
was my dog's name?" [laughter] "Well, I don't know." "What's the
capital of the city in which I was born?" "Well, I don't know." And
then you'd expect a third person watching this to say, "Who cares? It's
just--They're just doing this because of the coin they flipped." But in
fact, when the person watching this has to assess their intelligence
they give the quiz asker a higher intelligence rating than the other
person. After all, "He seemed to know a lot of answers. The other
person didn't get much right."</p>

<p>We tend to fail to discount the situation. If you were giving a job
talk--and this is for people in graduate school particularly--If you
were giving a job talk and the slide projector breaks, you're screwed.
Nobody is going to say to themselves, "Oh, well, it's not such a good
talk because the slide projector broke." They'll say, "It's not such a
good talk because of the person." Somebody could give a talk and we
could throw smarties at them the whole time and then you could--then
the other people would say, "The person looked kind of upset during the
whole talk. [laughter] I wonder--They seemed like a nervous type."
[laughter]</p>

<p>This can be taken to extremes and the biggest extreme is the case of
actors, which is if there's ever a case--Anybody know who this is, the
actor? [laughter] Have none of you been alive in 1950? [laughter] This
is Robert Young. Does anybody know the part he plays? He played an--He
played a doctor called Marcus Welby in this famous show "Marcus Welby,
M.D.," and Marcus Welby was a wonderful doctor. He was compassionate
and kind, he made house calls, he saved lives, he counseled people, and
it turned out that Robert Young was then deluged with mail, thousands
of pieces of mail, by people asking for his advice on health matters.
[laughter] And he then, in a twist, exploited the fundamental
attribution error--people confusing the actor for the role--exploited
this by going on TV and espousing the benefits of Sanka decaffeinated
coffee where he produced the famous line "I am not a doctor but I play
one on TV," [laughter] whereupon people heard this and said, "Well, he
must have some authority then about medical matters." [laughter]</p>

<p>It turns out that the confusion between actors and their roles is
extremely common. Many people, for instance, view Sylvester Stallone as
either an actual hero during the Vietnam War or sort of a hero during
the Vietnam War given all his Rambo stuff but in fact, of course, he
played--he was in a Swiss boarding school teaching girls age twelve
through fifteen during the Vietnam War. But it doesn't seem that way
because the role infects how we think about the person. When this movie
came out twenty years ago they needed a character to play a gay man.
According to IMDb, [The International Movie Database] where I get all
my information, they hit up all the big stars, Harrison Ford, Michael
Douglas, and Richard Gere, and they all turned it down because they
didn't want to play a gay man because people would think that they were
gay. Finally, they got Harry Hamlin to do it, who was kind of a B-list
sort of guy.</p>

<p>The biggest extreme of the fundamental attribution error, confusing
the actor for his role, is Leonard Nimoy who, because he played the
emotionless Vulcan, Spock, on Star Trek, was then repeatedly viewed by
people who saw him on the street as if he was an actual Vulcan.
[laughter] He got sufficiently upset about this to write a book called
<i>I Am Not Spock</i> where he described all the ways in which he was
not a Vulcan. [laughter] His career, where he attempted many times to
play roles that were different from his Vulcan nature, stalled until
finally many years later he gave up and wrote another book called <i>I
Am Spock</i> [laughter] where he finally conceded to the fundamental
attribution error. [laughter]</p>

<p>If I gave this lecture ten years ago, I would say that the
fundamental attribution error is a human universal, something that
we're born with, a fundamental aspect of human nature. This is not
entirely true though and we know that through some very interesting
cross-cultural research that compares these biases across different
countries, in this study between the United States and India. And it
turns out that for whatever reason, and it would take another course to
talk about the different explanations, but people start off at, say,
age eight not committing the fundamental attribution error but in
Western cultures, where there's an ideology perhaps that people are in
charge of their own destiny, the error occurs and people over-attribute
the role to the person.</p>

<p>In some Eastern cultures there's more of a view about faith and more
attributions to situation. And this has been shown in many ways. For
instance, if you look at newspaper reports about murders, in cultures
like the United States the report tends to emphasize the personal
characteristics of the person accused of the murder. In countries like
India, the reports tend to emphasize, to a greater degree, the
situation that the person found himself in that might have driven him
to commit a murder. So, this is an important reminder that just because
we find something in our culture and just because it might well be
pervasive doesn't mean necessarily that it's universal.</p>

<p>So, to summarize so far, and we're going to look at this a little
bit more for the rest of this lecture, we've talked about two morals in
social psychology. One is enhancement of the self but the other is what
you can call "oversimplification of the other." So, we know ourselves
that our behavior is due to a complicated cluster of the situation and
our personal natures. When things go badly, in fact, we'll blame the
situation. When things go well, the self-serving attribution bias,
we'll credit ourselves. We don't do this for other people. For other
people we're a lot less forgiving. You do something stupid,
that's--you're a stupid person. I do something stupid, it's an off day.
And so, you have this difference between how we think about ourselves
and how we think about other people.</p>

<p>Let's talk a little bit about what we think about other people and
start by talking about why we like other people. And here I'm going to
some extent to go over material that was raised earlier in the course
in Peter Salovey's wonderful lecture. So, some of this, our liking of
other people, is obvious and we talked about it in Dean Salovey's
lecture, we talked about it when we talked about sexual attractiveness.
We like people who are honest, who are kind, who are smart, who are
funny, but study after study finds more fundamental processes are also
at work and here is a list of three of them.</p>

<p>One is proximity. We tend to like people who we're close to
physically, who we are physically and spatially close to, who we spend
a lot of time with. In one study they looked at a housing project in
Manhattan and they asked people where their best friend was and 90% of
them said, "My best friend is in the same building as me," and 50% of
them says the same floor. Ask yourself who is your best friend at Yale.
For how many of you is it somebody in your same college? Okay. How many
in a different college? So, call it a tie but then there's a lot more
colleges that aren't yours than the one--How many of you would you--say
your best friend is somebody your--currently on your same floor? Yeah.
If you were going to marry somebody from this class, it is the person
you are sitting next to? [laughter]</p>

<p>Now, in some sense this is an--a rather trivial finding. Of course
you're going to get more involved in people you encounter frequently.
How else is it going to work? But it's actually more than that. The
more you see something the more you like it and this is sometimes known
as "the mere exposure effect." The mere exposure effect is simply
seeing something makes it likable perhaps because it becomes
comfortable and safe. In one study by James Cutting, Cutting taught an
Introduction to Psychology course and before each lecture he'd flash
pictures on the screen. He'd have a screen saver showing pictures on
the screen, paintings, and didn't say anything about them. People would
sit down, look at them while they prepared their notes. At the end of
the semester he then asked people to rate different pictures as to how
much they liked them, and even though people had no memory of seeing
one or--versus the other they tend to like the pictures more that they
had seen before. They were somehow familiar and somehow more
likable.</p>

<p>If I showed you a picture of yourself versus a mirror image of
yourself and asked which one you'd like more, the answer is very
strong. You'd like your mirror image more because the mirror image is
what you tend to see from day to day. If I showed your best friend a
picture of you versus a mirror image picture of you, your best friend
would say he or she likes the picture more because that corresponds to
what he or she sees each day. Familiarity is itself a desire for
liking, a force for liking.</p>

<p>Similarity--we like people who are similar to us. Friends tend to be
highly similar to one another. So do husbands and wives. Now, to some
extent, similarity is hard to pull apart from proximity. So, the fact
that you are similar to your friends at Yale might just be because you
are close to your friends at Yale and people who are at Yale tend to be
fairly similar to one another. But there's a lot of evidence that
similarity, above and beyond proximity, has an effect on attractiveness
and on liking. Similarity predicts the success of a marriage and
through a phenomena people aren't exactly sure about, couples become
more and more similar over the course of a relationship.</p>

<p>Finally, people like good-looking people. People like attractive
people. Physically attractive people are thought to be smarter, more
competent, more social and nicer. Now, some of you who are very cynical
and/or very good looking might wonder "yes, but good-looking people
like me actually are smarter, more competent, more social and morally
better." This is not a crazy response. It is--it could be, for
instance, that the advantages of being good looking make your life run
a lot easier. Teachers are more responsive to you, people treat you
better, you have more opportunities to make your way through the world,
you make more money, you have more access to things, and that could, in
turn, cause you to improve your life. This would be what's known in the
Bible as a "Matthew effect." A Matthew effect is a developmental
psychology phrase for the sort of thing where, well, as Jesus said,
"For unto everyone that hath shall be given and he shall have
abundance." That means if you're good looking you'll also be smart but
from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
It's a long version of the rich get richer and the poor even lose what
they hath. So, there's a variety of studies suggesting that teachers
rate attractive children as smarter and higher achieving. Adults think
that when an ugly kid misbehaves it's because they have an ugly soul
[laughter] while the attractive kid, "oh, that little scamp, somebody
must have been bothering him."</p>

<p>When I was in the University of Arizona and we lived next--and all I
remember of my neighborhood is we lived next to this little boy and his
name was Adonis. [laughter] Cute kid, but come on. [laughter] Also in
mock trials judges give longer prison sentences to ugly people.
[laughter] That's the Matthew effect, those who hath little get even
that taken away and thrown into prison.</p>

<p>There is a recent study, which I'll tell you about but I am not
comfortable with it as an experiment. The study observed people in a
shopping--in a parking lot of a supermarket and found that parents were
a lot rougher to the kids if their kids are ugly than if their kids are
good looking. And they attribute it to the fact that, for all sorts of
reasons, the ugly kid just matters less to the parent. I was watching a
poker game once on TV and somebody who lost said, and I quote, "They
beat me like an ugly stepchild" [laughter] and the fate of the ugly
stepchild is, in fact, not a very good fate but this is not a good
study. For one thing, and I don't know how to phrase this in a
politically correct way, but the parents of ugly kids are likely to
themselves be ugly people [laughter] and maybe what they're finding is
just ugly people are more violent than good-looking people. [laughter]
This is an excellent time to stop the lecture [laughter] so I'm going
to stop the lecture and we're going to continue social psychology on
Wednesday.</p>
