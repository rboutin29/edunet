<h3>About the Course</h3>
<p>What do your dreams mean? Do men and women differ in the 
nature and intensity of their sexual desires? Can apes learn sign language? Why canâ€™t we tickle ourselves? This course tries to answer these questions and many others, providing a comprehensive overview of the scientific study of thought and behavior. It explores topics such as perception, communication, learning, memory, decision-making, religion, persuasion, love, lust, hunger, art, fiction, and dreams. We will look at how these aspects of the mind develop in children, how they differ across people, how they are wired-up in the brain, and how they break down due to illness and injury. <br />
