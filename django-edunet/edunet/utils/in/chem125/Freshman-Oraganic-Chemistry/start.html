            <h3>About the Course</h3>
            <p>This is the first semester in a two-semester introductory course focused on current theories of structure and mechanism in organic chemistry, their historical development, and their basis in experimental observation. The course is open to freshmen with excellent preparation in chemistry and physics, and it aims to develop both taste for original science and intellectual skills necessary for creative research. <a href="content/sessions.html">view class sessions &gt;&gt;</a></p>

            </h3>
            <p>J. Michael McBride is the Richard M. Colgate Professor of Chemistry at Yale University. After undergraduate work at the College of Wooster and Harvard College Professor McBride earned a Ph.D. in physical organic chemistry at Harvard University. He joined the Yale Chemistry faculty in 1966, where he studies crystal growth and reactions in organic solids. His awards include the Prelog Medal, the Nobel Laureate Signature Award in Graduate Education, and the Catalyst Award of the Chemical Manufacturers Association for undergraduate education. Further details on his life, research, and teaching are available in  <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cg0505362" target="_blank">Crystal Growth & Design</a>, 2005, 5 (6), pp 2022–2035. <br />
