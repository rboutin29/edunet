<h3>About the Course</h3>
<p>This course presents the principles of evolution, ecology, and behavior for students beginning their study of biology and of the environment.  It discusses major ideas and results in a manner accessible to all Yale College undergraduates.  Recent advances have energized these fields with results that have implications well beyond their boundaries: ideas, mechanisms, and processes that should form part of the toolkit of all biologists and educated citizens.<a href="/ecology-and-evolutionary-biology/principles-of-evolution-ecology-and-behavior/content/sessions.html"> view class sessions &gt;&gt;</a></p>
