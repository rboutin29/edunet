Evolutionary Biology, Yale University</p>

<h4>Description:</h4>

<p class="lastParagraph">This course presents the principles of evolution, ecology, and behavior for students beginning their study of biology and of the environment.  It discusses major ideas and results in a manner accessible to all Yale College undergraduates.  Recent advances have energized these fields with results that have implications well beyond their boundaries: ideas, mechanisms, and processes that should form part of the toolkit of all biologists and educated citizens.</p>

The course grade consists of 25% from each midterm and 50% from the essay/section grade.</p>
<p>Special feature:  The course is designed to elicit your own, original questions about evolution, ecology, and behavior through interactions with a website featuring video and still images from the Galapagos and issues and questions posed by recent papers from the primary literature.  Your writing project and your take-home final will address questions you posed yourself, then refined in response to feedback from your TF.</p>
