<p><b>Professor Keith
Wrightson: </b>Right.
Let&#39;s get started. </p>
<p>Okay. Well, as you
know, in 1528 religious change had not been a significant issue in English
politics. By 1558, it was in many ways the central issue and it was about to
take another turn. On the 17th of November, 1558, Elizabeth I was proclaimed
queen, a young woman of twenty-five, highly intelligent, well educated and long
schooled in the necessity of caution, discretion and even dissimulation in
order to survive the dangers that she had faced. She was of course Anne
Boleyn&#39;s daughter, and as Anne Boleyn&#39;s daughter it was in a sense her
conception in December of 1532 that had finally precipitated the assertion of
Henry VIII&#39;s royal supremacy. So you could say in a sense that Elizabeth&#39;s
whole identity, and above all her claims to the throne, were bound up with the
rejection by her father of papal authority. </p>
<p>Now the precise
nature of her personal beliefs remains uncertain. She didn&#39;t really disclose
them, but unquestionably she identified herself with the Protestant cause. Shortly
after her accession, at Christmas 1558, she very ostentatiously walked out of
mass in the royal chapel at the point at which the host was elevated. A month
later in January 1559 she very ostentatiously embraced an English Bible which
was offered to her by the citizens of London on her state entry to London prior
to her coronation. So Elizabeth was making no secret of the fact that she
inclined towards reform, as indeed everyone expected. </p>
<p>But if she inclined
towards reform she was neither dogmatically nor straightforwardly Protestant,
and the religious settlement of 1559, the first business of her reign, very
much reflected that fact. It was in part the product of theological
convictions, but it was also very much a settlement that reflected a religious
preference that was tempered by sheer political expediency. What actually
happened remains rather cloudy--some aspects of the documentation are
inadequate--but the most convincing interpretation of the settlement to my mind
is that of Norman Jones. In his view Elizabeth and her chief adviser, William
Cecil, intended initially to return to the situation of 1552 just before the
death of her brother, Edward VI. But they met severe opposition in Parliament
particularly in the House of Lords, opposition not only from the Catholic
bishops who sat in the Lords but also from some of the leading lay members of
the peerage, and so they had to return to Parliament with a distinctly
watered-down draft prayer book setting out their desires for religious
settlement. </p>
<p>So, for example, in
1559 in the prayer book they brought to Parliament the communion service was in
fact a blend of the prayer book of 1552 with its very Protestant statements
regarding the communion service being essentially a service of remembrance and
thanksgiving. They blended that with the earlier 1549 prayer book which had
allowed for the possibility that there was a real presence of Christ&#39;s body and
blood in the communion service. And so in 1559 the wording at the
administration of the communion was as follows: the bread...&quot;the body of our
Lord Jesus Christ, which was given for thee preserve thy body and soul unto
everlasting life.&quot; That&#39;s 1549, followed immediately by &quot;take and eat
this in remembrance that Christ died for thee and feed on him in thy heart by faith
with thanksgiving&quot;; that&#39;s 1552. They blended the two together so that
you could read it as you chose. It&#39;s been described by Diarmaid MacCulloch as
&quot;a masterpiece of theological engineering,&quot; or fudging the issue you could say.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Again in 1559 the
bill brought before Parliament put forward the title for Elizabeth not as
supreme head of the Church of England but only of Supreme Governor. That&#39;s
often seen as being a more appropriate title for a woman, governor rather than
head, but it also of course left open the possibility that the settlement might
be accepted, that the position of supreme governor might be accepted, by people
who regarded the supreme head of the church as being elsewhere, in Rome. Even
so, despite these compromises, Elizabeth and her counselors were able to get
their settlement through Parliament only by purging the House of Lords. They
ruthlessly excluded many of the Catholic bishops in the end and they still got
a majority of only three votes. They squeezed it through the House of Lords. Support
in the commons was much stronger. </p>
<p>So the Church of
England was reestablished. English was Protestant again, sort of. It was a
confessional state bound by an Act of Uniformity that the prayer book should be
used throughout the kingdom, uniformity to the religion set down by the Queen
in Parliament, what was often described as &#39;the religion by law established&#39;.
But that religion was less imposed by simple royal dictate than a reflection of
what Elizabeth and her advisers had proved willing to settle for. There was no
doubt that England had turned in a broadly Protestant direction again, but
there was also a lot of ambiguity about the nature and the extent of that
Protestantism. </p>
<p>Okay. Well, maybe
Elizabeth and William Cecil and the other counselors got less than they
originally intended, but they accepted it, and they could even use it to their
advantage. It was perhaps no bad thing in the England of 1559 that the
religious settlement contained a lot of ambiguity. Thirty years of religious
flux had left the nation profoundly divided in matters of faith. No change
during those thirty years had had time to put down deep roots. To some
historians like Christopher Haigh most of the people remained, in the main,
traditionalists in their religious beliefs. To other historians like Robert
Whiting people had grown almost indifferent, acquiescing and conforming to
change after change, but essentially guarded and unenthusiastic in their
attitudes. But also, as you&#39;ve seen in last week&#39;s reading, there was a third
reading of the situation represented by the work of Christopher Marsh. People
were now only too aware of the existence of alternatives in religion,
alternatives which hadn&#39;t existed back in the 1520s. Some of them hankered
after the old ways, some of them were drawn to the attractive features of the
new doctrines, but everyone knew the danger of religious conflict. They&#39;d
witnessed enough of that under Mary. </p>
<p>As a result, Marsh
suggests they &quot;held their peace,&quot; and as you know he uses that term in a double
sense: negatively in the sense that they were compliant, they remained silent
before the demands of authority; positively in the sense that they preserved
the peace of their own communities as best they could. One could say that that
was an attitude that had developed as a result of the turmoil of the late 1540s
and early 1550s in particular. Even under Mary, the mayor of Exeter in the
west, down here in Devon, was a man who although a devout Catholic in his own
practice regarded Protestant sympathizers among his neighbors with some
discretion and tolerance. It was said of him that he did &quot;friendly and
lovingly bear with them and wink at them,&quot; he shut his eyes to their practice.
And one could say that Elizabeth was winking at people too. She winked at
people in many ways. [Laughter] She was the Supreme Governor of
the Church of England. She was the head of a confessional state but she also
said early in her reign, &quot;I will not make windows into men&#39;s souls&quot;; a
striking metaphor, &quot;I will not make windows into men&#39;s souls.&quot; </p>
<p>What she and her
counselors wanted was order, outward conformity, stability, and in pursuit of
those objectives the ambiguities of 1559 were in many ways advantageous and
they could be developed. Soon after the passage of the settlement through
Parliament, a set of injunctions concerning worship were issued. They
permitted the images which had survived Protestant iconoclasm to remain in
churches so long as they were not superstitiously abused. They said that in
future communion tables were to be used for holy communion rather than altars,
but nonetheless the communion table could stand where the old altar had stood. At
holy communion traditional wafers were used rather than common bread. There
were many concessions of this kind. Elizabeth herself would have liked to have
kept the rood screens above the chancel with their crucifixes, etc. She kept a
crucifix in her own chapel. But her more Protestant bishops really wouldn&#39;t
stand for that and many rood screens were gradually dismantled throughout the
kingdom in the course of the 1560s. </p>
<p>Or again in dealing
with the clergy, she faced in Parliament bishops who put up such a stiff
opposition that she was forced to deprive them. She would have liked them to
stay. They didn&#39;t, but new appointments to the Episcopal bench were rarely
religious extremists. It was significant that she chose as Archbishop of
Canterbury Matthew Parker, a Cambridge academic who was a Protestant certainly,
but who had not gone into exile under Mary. He had conformed and kept his head
down. She considered Parker a more appropriate choice than some of the more
radical Protestants that she could have selected. Amongst the parish clergy
too there was no mass purge. Many of the clergy were allowed to keep their
positions and even to get away with formally subscribing to the prayer book and
the Act of Uniformity but continuing many traditional practices unhindered. </p>
<p>The toleration which
was extended to traditional practices allowed them to preserve in many ways the
appearance of tradition in the way they conducted services in their parishes. Christopher
Haigh has a nice phrase for it. He says many of these people were &quot;liturgical
hermaphrodites.&quot; They used the prayer book but they could tweak it their own
way. Again fines were laid down for people who failed to attend the Church of
England at least once a month but they were set very low. The fine was twelve
pence a month if you failed to attend Church of England services, which was
about the equivalent of a day&#39;s wages for a London laborer, not a steep fine at
all. </p>
<p>So what did it all
mean? Clearly, Elizabeth was no Catholic but she refused to persecute, and
equally she refused to countenance any further reform. She seems to have
learned her lesson in 1559 about the art of the possible and she stuck to it.
And that came out very clearly just a few years later in 1563 when at a meeting
of the convocation of the Church of England, the assembly of the clergy of the
Church of England, there occurred what&#39;s known as the Vestiarian Controversy. Some
of the more radical Protestants in convocation wanted to get rid of traditional
vestments worn by the priests during services. They described them as the &quot;rags
of Rome.&quot; These, however, had been retained in the prayer book of 1559 and
Elizabeth insisted upon retaining traditional clerical dress and forced
Archbishop Parker to demand it of the clergy. </p>
<p>So what was England&#39;s
religion in the 1560s? Ultimately, one could say it was the Queen&#39;s religion. With
regard to the pope&#39;s authority, it was emphatically schismatic. Papal
authority had been abrogated once again. With regard to essential doctrines,
it was essentially Protestant, but nonetheless it retained a latitude to make
of the settlement, to read the prayer book, as you chose provided you conformed
in general. The only element of settlement one could say which was totally
without ambiguity was the Act of Uniformity; conform and hold your peace. </p>
<p>Well, in an age of
religious partisanship, in what was already becoming in Europe an age of
religious war, that was not really a bad deal. But of course it couldn&#39;t stand
there. Whatever the ambiguities of the settlement, first of all no one could
really doubt that it was basically Protestant in orientation, and secondly no
one yet knew that Elizabeth would live to be seventy. And those two facts
shaped the attitudes of both committed Catholics and the more committed
Protestants, and by 1560 of course there were plenty of both. Both groups of
zealots were preoccupied with what might happen next. Would there be another
turn of the wheel? Would Elizabeth survive? And both sides were determined to
do what they could to shape events to their own advantage if such a possibility
of future change emerged. </p>
<p>So let&#39;s look at the
two groups who opposed in different ways the Elizabethan settlement and how
their challenges were met. We can start by looking at the Catholics. </p>
<p>Christopher Haigh
argues, persuasively I think, that there was a great deal of what he calls
traditionalist &quot;survivalism.&quot; To a considerable degree, the early Elizabethan
church was attempting to accommodate that traditionalism amongst the population
as a whole. But the more committed, more theologically aware and more politically
aware Catholics knew that this was a recipe for the gradual erosion of Catholic
principle. There were a lot of people who were described at the time as
&quot;church papists&quot; in the 1560s, people whose bodies were in the Church of
England, as it were, but whose hearts remained with the old religion. Such
people would gradually become hopelessly compromised over time unless something
was done to stiffen their resistance to a gradual slide into conformity and
acceptance of the new ways. And in the eyes of those who feared this there was,
after all, every possibility that the settlement of 1559 would not endure any
longer than other changes. </p>
<p>It all hung on the
life of one young woman and in 1562 Elizabeth contracted smallpox and almost
died. Her counselors were in a panic as she lay on her sick bed. She
recovered, but it was a warning of what could happen. We have to remember
this, this vital element of uncertainty, whenever we look at the Elizabethan
church and indeed at other aspects of her reign. So, you get in these years
the gradual emergence of what might be called a kind of shadow church or a
church in exile waiting for the possibility of a return to the old ways. And
the years 1568 to 1570 proved to be in many ways a turning point for these Catholics.
</p>
<p>In 1568, William
Allen, a former Oxford don who had fled to the continent, founded a college at
Douai in the Netherlands for the purpose of training priests who would be
smuggled back into England and who could operate in secrecy to stiffen the faith
of English Catholics. In the same year, in May of 1568, Mary Stuart, the Queen
of Scotland, a Catholic, was deposed by her own subjects and fled into England.
There she was kept under house arrest by Elizabeth, but while she remained she
was clearly a claimant to the English throne within reach of those who opposed
Elizabeth. She was Elizabeth&#39;s nearest relative, her cousin, and a Catholic. I&#39;ll
say more about Mary, Queen of Scots next time, but her presence is a constant
factor in the equation. </p>
<p>In 1567 to &#39;68,
almost simultaneously, came the outbreak of the Dutch revolt, a revolt of the
provinces of the Netherlands, just across the narrow seas, against Spanish
rule, which led to the establishment in the Netherlands of a powerful Spanish
army to put down that revolt sent by King Philip II of Spain, the champion of
the Counter Reformation in Europe. Its arrival was followed by a massive
repression of Protestants in the Netherlands and the flight of many of them to
England. And in the following year, in 1569, came the revolt of the northern
earls. </p>
<p>That began with a
plot to release Mary, Queen of Scots from captivity, to marry her to the Duke
of Norfolk, who was a crypto-Catholic, to restore her to the Scottish throne
with the help of the Spanish army, which was just over the seas in the
Netherlands, and to depose Elizabeth. When the scheme was discovered by
Elizabeth&#39;s intelligence service the earls of Northumberland and of
Westmorland, the two dominant nobles of the north, rose in rebellion. They
raised about 5,000 men. They captured the city of Durham. They restored the
mass in Durham Cathedral. They moved gradually south. The government
responded to the rising by securing Mary and moving her south out of their
reach. She was placed under the tutelage of the Earl of Shrewsbury down in the
Midlands. The northern earls failed to move swiftly. They got bogged down
besieging a castle near Durham which was held by the loyal Bowes family for
Elizabeth and eventually realizing that their support was eroding they gave up
and fled into Scotland. There then followed two years of diplomatic and
military bullying before eventually the Earl of Northumberland was surrendered
back to the English and was executed. </p>
<p>By then the rebellion
was long over. By December 1569, it had proved to be a fiasco and had fizzled
out, but in February 1570, rather too late, the Pope, having heard of it,
offered his support. He excommunicated Elizabeth and he absolved her subjects
from their obedience to the Queen. He was telling her Catholic subjects, in
other words, that rebellion against this heretic queen was no sin--a little too
late, but nonetheless at last a clarifying decision on the part of the papacy
with regard to Elizabeth. For the Catholic subjects of the Queen in 1568 to
&#39;70 one could say the moment of truth had at last come. At last there had been
principled resistance to the Elizabeth settlement, at last there had been a
lead from the papacy, but in a sense it was also a disaster for the average
traditionalist in religion. Now they were in a position where they had to
choose. They had to make a stand, like it or not. Geopolitical realities
increasingly demanded it, and for many of them that was an absolutely agonizing
situation. </p>
<p>And in the years that
followed, in many ways, it got worse. From the mid 1570s missionary priests
trained in the Netherlands began arriving to stiffen the faith of the Catholic
faithful. There were something like sixty who arrived in the course of the
later 1570s. Between then and the end of the reign in 1603, something like 500
Catholic priests were smuggled into England to operate in secret. From the
1580s, they were joined by another group, the Jesuits, the shock troops of the
Catholic Counter Reformation in Europe who joined in the mission to England. </p>
<p>Now of course from
their perspective these were heroic people, and yet they were fatally
compromised by their association with a foreign power, Spain, and they were
inevitably associated with the dynamics of religious conflict in Europe--not
least because some of the leaders of the Catholic mission subscribed to the
view that it was no sin to depose or even murder a heretical monarch. And so
began a series of plots which were uncovered throughout the middle and later
years of Elizabeth&#39;s reign. In 1571, the Ridolfi plot to depose Elizabeth,
place Mary, Queen of Scots on the throne, marry her to the Duke of Norfolk. That
ended in 1572 with the execution of Norfolk. In 1572, the news came from
France of the Saint Bartholomew&#39;s Day Massacre of Protestants in Paris. This
seemed a demonstration from abroad of the risk of Catholic treachery. In 1583,
the Throckmorton plot to murder Elizabeth was uncovered. A year later in 1584,
the leader of the Dutch Protestants, William the Silent, was murdered in the
Netherlands. In 1586, the Babington plot to depose Elizabeth and elevate Mary,
Queen of Scots to the throne was uncovered. </p>
<p>The atmosphere then
was one of tremendous insecurity and the government&#39;s response was severe. In
1581, it was declared by Parliament treason to be absolved from schism with
Rome and to be reconciled to the Catholic church. Recusancy fines for not
attending the Church of England were raised from one shillings a month to twenty
pounds. That&#39;s a four hundredfold increase in the size of recusancy fines. In
1585, England was at last, after long hesitation, brought to declare open war
with Spain and to send troops to the Netherlands to help stiffen the resistance
of the Dutch Protestants. And in the same year Parliament made it treason for
any ordained priest of the Catholic church even to enter England. For a priest
to be found on English soil was treason. In 1586, following the Babington plot,
Mary, Queen of Scots was at last brought to trial, sentenced to death, and then,
after long hesitation on the part of Elizabeth, finally beheaded in February
1587. And then in 1588 the whole nation was mobilized to resist the threat of
invasion by the Spanish Armada--a great fleet sent by Philip II intended to
pick up troops in the Netherlands, transport them across the narrow seas, and
attack London. A plan which was eventually foiled only by the resistance which
was put up by the English fleet in the Channel and then the scattering of
Spanish ships as they sailed north and eventually around Scotland and Ireland
to return to Spain, many of them being lost on the way. Following the--what
was seen as the--divine deliverance in the Armada campaign the war dragged on
right through to the end of Elizabeth&#39;s reign. </p>
<p>Well, in such a
context any priests who landed in England to do God&#39;s work amongst the Catholic
faithful as they saw it, were inevitably regarded by the government as the
traitorous servants of a foreign power. Between 1581 and 1603, 131 Catholic
priests were arrested and executed together with sixty of the lay people who
had hid them, all of them being executed as traitors. These are those who are
regarded in the English Catholic tradition as the Catholic [correction:
English] Martyrs. And in a nation that was increasingly prone to regard itself
as a beleaguered island threatened by mighty enemies, Catholicism almost
inevitably became tainted by its association with that threat. Of course, that
was mistaken. Many of the Catholic nobility and gentry went out of their way
to stress their loyalty to Elizabeth; that they would not support any foreign
invasion; that they would indeed sometimes openly declare themselves as
sufficiently loyal to oppose it. They were well known. They were often trusted
as individuals by their Protestant neighbors. The fines levied upon them for
their Catholic recusancy were often very selectively and intermittently
enforced. Amongst the Catholic population as a whole there were only a tiny
number of zealots who were ever actively involved in treasonable plots,
especially against the Queen&#39;s life. Nevertheless, be that as it may, in the
situation after 1570, and especially after the outbreak of war in 1585, the
Catholic community as an entity lay under the shadow of distrust and it was
subject to a developing prejudice which would take centuries to dispel. As
Patrick Collinson has written, anti-Catholicism became almost &quot;a sheet anchor
of English nationhood&quot; and the Catholic community within England became in a
sense aliens within their own land.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>What about the other
threat?--the radical Protestants, those who we think of now as Puritans but
that was not a term they used initially. It was a term of insult that was
sometimes thrown at them. They were described usually at the time as &quot;the
hotter sort of Protestants&quot;; &quot;the hotter sort of Protestants.&quot; To them the
accession of Elizabeth in 1558 had been a providential deliverance, a divine
intervention in English affairs. November the 17th, the Queen&#39;s accession day,
was celebrated with the ringing of bells; it became almost like a Protestant
holy day. But though they regarded the Church of England which she established
a year later in 1559 as undoubtedly a true church, it seemed to these
Protestant radicals that it was a church which was only half reformed, and they
too were worried about what might happen next. They could have no certainty
that it would last. They were anxious to push ahead, to consolidate the
position, to move urgently to what they described as &quot;further reformation.&quot; </p>
<p>Especially they
wanted reformation of some of the traditionalist structures of the Church of
England and the removal of some of the more traditional aspects of its forms of
worship. They wanted to get rid of the &quot;rags of Rome&quot; or the &quot;dregs the popery.&quot;
This is the sort of language they used. So there was from the beginning an
element of dissidence even amongst those who could be regarded as Elizabeth&#39;s
most enthusiastic supporters. And that was especially true amongst the younger
clergy who were emerging from the universities, now thoroughly trained in
Protestant doctrine, and who were becoming, if anything, more emphatically
Protestant even than those who had led the church in the later years of Edward VI.</p>
<p>This younger
generation were moving beyond the doctrinal position which had been established
by Archbishop Cranmer in the early 1550s and was enshrined in the prayer book.
Increasingly, they felt the influence of John Calvin, the great Protestant
leader of Geneva, and his successor there, Theodore Beza. In terms of the
doctrine of salvation, they increasingly adopted the doctrine of
&#39;predestination&#39; championed by Calvin; the notion that only an elect minority
would find salvation. Many also adopted the doctrine of double predestination
championed by Beza; the view that God had decreed from the beginning of the
world who would be elect and who would be damned. </p>
<p>This kind of belief
bred amongst them a very anxious spirituality. At the individual level they
were deeply anxious about their own spiritual state. Were they or were they
not amongst the elect? They tended to indulge in intense spiritual
self-searching, rigorous attempts to sanctify their personal lives in a way
that would give them a sense of assurance of their own election. It was also a
kind of theological position which bred what&#39;s been described as a &quot;piebald
mentality.&quot; They saw things in very black and white terms, a piebald
mentality. The godly saw themselves as a beleaguered minority in a world that
was dominated by the reprobate, the unregenerate. They tended to describe
themselves as the &quot;little flock,&quot; the &quot;godly remnant,&quot; and that in turn seems
to have bred amongst them a kind of activist mentality. There was a duty to
demonstrate their own godliness by standing up for the honor of God, by doing His
work in the world, by spreading truth, by combating sin and error. A form of
activism which in a sense could give them greater assurance. </p>
<p>For the most part,
they did that work in relative obscurity, down in the many parishes of the
kingdom. Puritans were amongst the most zealous preachers. They were often
chosen as &#39;lecturers&#39;, people who would be hired by local authorities to preach
extra sermons on market days, for example, or on the weekdays. In some areas
they were numerous enough by the 1570s to found regular meetings of
sympathizers which were known as &quot;prophesyings.&quot; These were meetings of the
local clergy who would get together to hear a sermon, to debate its doctrine. They
often opened these meetings to members of the laity. It was thought to be an
excellent method of improving clerical knowledge, of passing on theological
knowledge to the godly laity, and in areas of--some areas of--the country they
were extremely influential in influencing the whole tone of local religious
life. East Anglia was a great area of Puritan strength. There were eight of
these prophesying meetings in the county of Suffolk in the middle of East
Anglia and in the county of Essex, just to the south, there were six of them
operating by the early 1570s. </p>
<p>But after 1570
Puritanism also began to acquire something of a political edge. Specifically,
that came in the form of a movement to try to formally alter the structures of
the Church of England and to purge the prayer book of what they saw as
traditional papist survivals. Those who became involved in it were convinced
that the New Testament laid down a clear model of church government, that it
did not involve bishops, that it should be based upon autonomous congregations
who elected their own ministers and elders, who would in turn meet together at
the higher level in councils and synods to govern the church as a whole. In
other words, a Presbyterian system of church government. This is what they
desired, and advocates of such a system were to mount a series of challenges to
the Elizabethan settlement between 1570 and 1587. And there were a number of
landmarks in that process. </p>
<p>In 1570, for example,
the professor of divinity at the University of Cambridge, Thomas Cartwright,
gave a series of lectures in the university in which he argued that the English
church failed to follow the model of the New Testament and advocated a
Presbyterian system. There was a tremendous controversy in the university as a
result. Cartwright in fact lost his job. He was quickly picked up by one of
Elizabeth&#39;s favorites, the Earl of Leicester, who sympathized with the Puritans,
and placed in a living elsewhere. So he survived, but he lost his position at
the university. In 1571, in Parliament, one member, William Strickland,
introduced a bill to revise the prayer book and purge it. Members of the
council sitting in Parliament opposed this move. He was called before the royal
Privy Council and warned not to trespass on the Queen&#39;s prerogative in matters
of religion. But a year later when Parliament met again John Field and Thomas
Wilcox, two leading Puritans, published the &quot;Admonition to
Parliament,&quot; an outspoken attack upon the structure of the Church of
England as not being a truly reformed church, calling on Parliament to take
steps to further reform it. Indeed, it was so extreme in some of its
statements that it greatly scandalized moderates amongst Protestants and there
was no successful action in Parliament. </p>
<p>In 1576, there came a
further attempt to discuss the church in Parliament, and on that occasion
Elizabeth had to intervene personally to ban discussion of religion in
Parliament. The Queen also became convinced in that year that the prophesying
meetings were a destabilizing influence on the church in the localities. She
ordered Archbishop Grindal to put a stop to them. The Archbishop protested. He
thought they were doing good work; they were beneficial to the clergy. As a
result, the Queen simply suspended him and the Archbishop of Canterbury himself
was suspended from exercising his duties from 1577 through to his death in
1583. </p>
<p>Well, at that point,
Grindal&#39;s death in 1583 could be said in a sense to symbolize the passing away
of the first generation of Elizabethan bishops, many of them people who half
sympathized with the desire for further reformation within the church, men who
had been willing to serve, willing to bear with the Elizabethan compromise for
the time being, but in their hearts would have liked to have seen more. The
phrase that was often used for people like that was that they were willing to &quot;tarry
for the magistrate,&quot; they were willing to wait until such time as the Queen was
willing to move further in a Protestant direction. And they were gradually
being replaced by people of a different stamp, and the most significant of the
new bishops to emerge was the new Archbishop of Canterbury, John Whitgift. </p>
<p>Whitgift was a very
different kind of man from Grindal. He was a Calvinist in his doctrine, no
Protestant could ask for more in terms of his theological position, but he was
also a man who had grown up with the Elizabethan settlement and who was deeply
committed to the settlement in itself. In addition to which he was a firm
disciplinarian, and in 1583 as a means of preventing further action on the part
of Puritans Whitgift introduced what was known as the Three Articles to which
each of the clergy was required to subscribe. They included recognition of the
royal supremacy, recognition of the Thirty Nine Articles of Religion laying
down the doctrine of the Church of England, and taking an oath that there was
nothing in the Prayer Book which was contrary to the word of God. He proceeded
to use the church courts and particularly his own Court of High Commission to
examine suspected dissidents within the church under oath and to administer the
Three Articles. He was in fact prevented by members of Elizabeth&#39;s council
sympathetic to the Puritan cause from taking this policy as far as he would
have liked. Nonetheless, it was a clear statement of his unwillingness to
tolerate dissidence from radical Protestants. </p>
<p>Well, the advent of
Whitgift perhaps provoked what turned out to be the Presbyterian or Puritans&#39;
final throw. Some of the prophesying meetings which were now forbidden simply
went underground. In some areas they developed into what&#39;s known as the &quot;Classis&quot;
movement, secret meetings of the clergy who were practicing a kind of
underground Presbyterianism. John Field, one of the authors of the
&quot;Admonition to Parliament&quot; in 1572, built up quite an extensive
network of Presbyterian sympathizers amongst the clergy and the laity
throughout the kingdom. And that network was activated in 1584 and 1586 to try
to introduce further bills into Parliament calling for a Presbyterian system
and the revision of the prayer book. These attempts were again scotched by
royal councilors sitting in Parliament. In 1586, for example, Parliament
itself sent both the promoter of the bill and those who defended it in
Parliament to the Tower of London briefly to cool their heels. </p>
<p>The Presbyterians had
failed again. But the exasperation and the frustration that they felt was
vividly expressed in 1588 to &#39;89 in the secret publication of a number of
extremely scurrilous attacks upon the bishops of the Church of England. These
were known as the <i>Marprelate Tracts. </i>They were directed against bishops,
prelates; the <i>Marprelate Tracts. </i>The Archbishop of Canterbury
instigated an investigation to discover the secret press that was producing
them, and in the course of that John Field&#39;s Puritan network was uncovered and
the movement was essentially smashed. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the
1580s drew to a close, some of the leaders of Puritanism were dying away. John
Field died in 1588. Some of his sympathizers in the Royal Council, the Duke
[correction: Earl] of Leicester, Sir Francis Walsingham, Sir Walter Mildmay all
died in 1589 or 1590. Puritanism as a political movement was over for the time
being but it left three legacies. </p>
<p>First of all, there
were small groups of Puritan extremists who were so disillusioned that they
broke from the Church of England altogether and formed separatist congregations
meeting in secret. One of their leaders said that they had decided they would
have &quot;reformation without tarrying for any.&quot; They wouldn&#39;t tarry for the
magistrate; they would have reformation without tarrying for any. Some of them
were eventually forced to flee abroad. The group led by Robert Browne based in
the city of Norwich removed themselves to the Netherlands to escape potential
persecution. Another group led by Henry Barrow in London went underground and
some of them eventually also emigrated to the Netherlands where they enjoyed
religious freedom in the Protestant areas of the Netherlands. Henry Barrow,
returning to England at one point, was arrested and was eventually hanged for
sedition. It was from amongst these groups of radical separatists who had
broken completely with the Church of England that some of the Mayflower
Pilgrims of 1620 were eventually to be drawn. </p>
<p>So one legacy was
separatism, a tiny minority who broke away completely. Secondly, there was a
much broader legacy of activist evangelism within the Church of England. Many
Puritan sympathizers felt that if they could not change the structures of the
Church of England then they could at least transform its spirit and thereby
leave their own distinctive stamp on the nature of English Protestantism. They
advocated a religion heavily based upon the Bible: advocating preaching,
practicing the sanctification of the Sabbath, insisting upon strict moral
behavior, pursuing moral reformation where they had the power and the
opportunity, and they constantly drummed upon the theme of the failure of
England to live up to the--to show proper gratitude for God&#39;s deliverance of
the kingdom, the need to turn to a more strict religious observation in return
for God&#39;s favor. So that was the second legacy. </p>
<p>Thirdly, there was a
legacy of a different kind. Some of those who had defended the Elizabethan
settlement from Puritan attacks began to develop an altogether more positive
view of the Elizabethan settlement. They began to see it not just as a
temporary compromise, but as a distinctive and valid alternative, a distinctive
middle way between Catholicism on the one hand and radical Protestantism on the
other. Theologians like Richard Hooker and Richard Bancroft saw the retention
of a traditionalist structure in the Church of England as not simply a matter
of convenience, or political expediency, but as a valid Protestant alternative.
Indeed, in Bancroft&#39;s view, a divinely ordained form of church government in
which England maintained the tradition which descended from Christ&#39;s apostles,
purified of the corruptions which had crept in in the Catholic Middle Ages. So
a new and more positive notion of Anglicanism as a middle way was also emerging
amongst the defenders of the church. Diarmaid MacCulloch said of this that
&quot;perhaps the Anglican gift to the Christian story is the ability to make a
virtue of necessity.&quot;<sup>3</sup>
[Laughter] </p>
<p>But what finally
about those who were neither Catholics nor radical Puritans nor Anglican
divines, the mass of the people down in the parishes? It&#39;s been said that for
most of them the reformation under Elizabeth was essentially a series of
conforming experiences. A slow shift from the visual and ritual and symbolic
richness of late medieval religion to a somewhat plainer, more verbal, religion
based on the English Bible, based on the Prayer Book of 1559, including such
things as more frequent preaching, psalm singing, and other novel practices. That
process of gradual shift in religious culture was probably aided by the
elements of continuity observable in Church of England services and gradually
it did its work. The older generation of both the clergy and the laity who
could remember the old days had largely died away by the 1580s. An increasing
proportion of the population knew no other church than that of Elizabeth. They
faced no serious threat from the Catholic mission. The Catholic missionary
priests concentrated their attention on politically significant people. Most
of their work was done amongst the gentry, there was no real mission to the
common people, and by 1603 the Church of England had something like two and a
half million communicants while there were only some 8,000 to 9,000 known
Catholic recusants, most of them members of the gentry or their immediate
tenants sheltered under their protection. </p>
<p>To this extent one
could say that the Catholic threat was actually diminishing. Meanwhile, the
Anglican clergy were gradually adapting to their role as pastors and teachers. Initially,
there&#39;d been a severe shortage of preachers and of educated clergy, but steady
work by the bishops, steady work ordaining young men in the universities, meant
that by the death of Elizabeth preaching was commonplace in most areas of the
kingdom, the clergy were increasingly university graduates; their level of
learning was improving. The more severe and the more demanding of the clergy
could be highly critical of the religious attitudes of the common people. Some
of them saw the common people as being perhaps de-Catholicized, perhaps hostile
to papal authority, but scarcely Protestantized in any deep and meaningful
sense. But perhaps that&#39;s too harsh a judgment on people who have been nicely
described as &#39;parish Anglicans&#39; or &#39;prayer book Anglicans&#39;, building up a
loyalty for the form of religion with which they were familiar. </p>
<p>By the 1590s, it&#39;s
likely that they certainly thought of themselves as being members of the
Protestant family, as it were, even if their theological grasp on exactly what
that meant was probably rather shaky. At the same time of course it remained
the case that Puritans saw the reformation as essentially unfinished amongst
the population at large. And there were a fair number of people who shared
that perception--that it remained unfinished--for the audience of the godly
preachers was by 1603 significantly larger, significantly more literate,
significantly more likely to have a better knowledge of the Bible and of the
prayer book, significantly more likely to have read some of the English
language religious publications in the Puritan tradition which were pouring
from the presses; people more deeply involved in a vernacular religious
culture, much of it produced by Puritans who had abandoned their political
opposition but who had emerged as the most active evangelicals, the most
earnest, the most godly counselors of the Protestant tradition in the parishes.
</p>
<p>At this level the
later reformation was perhaps mostly un-dramatic except in the private drama of
people&#39;s personal conversion. But if the situation of 1600 was one of relative
calm it was also storing up the seeds of future drama. Protestantism was
gradually working its way into popular culture, the Puritan minority was
extending its influence, not as a political movement but as a widespread
religious style. Hostility to what was described as &#39;popery&#39; was increasingly
widespread, and tensions remained regarding what the nature of English
Protestantism should be. And they would give rise, as we will see later, to
what have been called England&#39;s wars of religion in the seventeenth century. Disputes
not between Catholics and Protestants--that was perhaps largely settled by 1600--but
disputes between different conceptions of what it was to be a Protestant. </p>
<p>Okay. And next time
I&#39;ll turn to other aspects of Elizabeth&#39;s reign and in particular the modes of
political participation and the queen&#39;s relationship with her counselors. </p>
