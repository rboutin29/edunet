<p><b>Professor Keith Wrightson:
</b>The
great political philosopher Thomas Hobbes--who, if you haven&#39;t read you will be
learning something about in the section reading this week--Thomas Hobbes
formulated his theory of the state and his ideas on political obligation in the
context of the civil wars which tore apart all three of the constituent
kingdoms of Britain in the 1640s. And when it was all over Hobbes, who had
returned from exile in the 1650s, wrote a history of the conflict which he
called <i>Behemoth</i>, published in 1662. The title&#39;s up here. And he began
it with this wonderful sentence, the first sentence of <i>Behemoth: </i>&quot;If in
time, as in place, there were degrees of high and low, I verily believe that
the highest of times would be that which passed betwixt 1640 and 1660.&quot; And
what Hobbes meant by that striking sentence was that the events of those two
decades unleashed consequences of an enormously far-reaching nature: in
politics of course, in religion, and also in the realm of ideas. Things would
never be quite the same again. </p>
<p>But if that&#39;s how it
looked to Hobbes at the end of the whole process, in the beginning, in 1637,
none of that could really be foreseen. In 1637, Charles I&#39;s experiment in
personal rule was going well and he had just succeeded in winning legal
backing, albeit narrowly, for the continued collection of Ship Money, an annual
non-parliamentary tax. But Charles&#39; relative success depended upon two things.
First of all, he needed to avoid unnecessary expense, especially the kind of
expenditure necessitated by war. Part of the reason for his success in the
1630s was that he had kept the kingdom at peace. Secondly, he needed to avoid
calling a parliament. He needed to avoid a parliament which would be a forum
for deeply alienated elements of the political nation who loathed his fiscal
expedients on the one hand, and on the other hand his Arminian policy in the
church. He needed time for such opposition to die down; if it would. And in
1638 to &#39;40 all of this collapsed. As I mentioned at the end of the last
lecture, in 1637 Charles and Archbishop William Laud overreached themselves by
attempting to impose uniformity on religion throughout not only England but
also Charles&#39; other kingdom of Scotland. </p>
<p>They attempted to
impose episcopacy and an Anglican-style prayer book upon the Church of
Scotland. In 1638, the Scots, led by many of their leading nobility and backed
by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, formed in Edinburgh a
National Covenant taken by all the leaders of the movement and many others to
resist innovations in religion and they proceeded to raise an army. In 1639,
Charles proved incapable of finding the resources to put an effective army in
the field to stop the Scottish rebellion and the Covenanters effectively
overran the whole of southern Scotland. It was completely in their control. In
desperate need of funds, the King was forced to call a parliament, and in 1640
the writs went out for what came to be known as the Short Parliament. </p>
<p>The elections which
were held in that year were unusually fraught. Customarily, in most counties
or urban constituencies election contests were relatively rare. Usually,
people somehow by consensus managed to decide who would represent them in parliament.
In the elections for the Short Parliament research has shown that in fact
there were contests in no fewer than a quarter of the constituencies, a very
high number for this period, contests between candidates who were regarded by
the electorate as, on the one hand, &#39;courtiers&#39; and candidates who were
regarded as having &#39;country&#39; values, that is to say staunch traditional
Protestants, adherents to the rule of law, supporters for parliament&#39;s
continued place in the political process. </p>
<p>When the Short
Parliament met late in April 1640 it immediately took up the old tactic from
the 1620s of agreeing that they would vote the King money, but only if their
grievances were first remedied, and indeed the very first speech made in the
Short Parliament in the House of Commons declared that the Scottish rebels were
less of a threat to the kingdom than the threat which was posed by the King&#39;s
government to the liberties of the subject. Charles responded by dissolving parliament
after roughly three weeks: hence its name, the Short Parliament. </p>
<p>Charles then
attempted to prepare to invade Scotland with the very inadequate resources at
his disposal. Troops were raised. They proceeded north amidst great
disorders. They were of low quality and poorly trained. And they were rapidly
defeated by a pre-emptive strike on the part of the Scots who crossed the
border, drove back the royal troops, and occupied the whole of the northeast of
England including the crucial strategic center of Newcastle, center of the coal
trade which supplied the fuel on which London depended. So the whole of the
northeast of England was under Scottish occupation. They then settled down,
waiting for negotiations and taxing the counties which they&#39;d occupied in order
to maintain their occupation. </p>
<p>I should just mention
the sudden success of the Scots should have been predictable. Many Scots had
served as mercenaries in the armies particularly of Sweden and of the
Netherlands in the Thirty Years War. They were very good experienced soldiers.
They&#39;d come home to defend the Covenant. They were led by David Leslie, a
general with a great deal of experience who had distinguished himself in
Swedish service. England had nothing comparable militarily. </p>
<p>Well, humiliated and
desperate, Charles called another parliament, this one to meet in November
1640, and the whole country was galvanized by this second election. There were
even more election contests. It&#39;s thought that about a third of constituencies
were contested in the elections for the Long Parliament. Indeed it&#39;s been
suggested that nationwide perhaps between a quarter and a third of all adult
males voted in the election for the Long Parliament. </p>
<p>The members elected
arrived in Westminster bringing with them petitions from their counties
cataloging their grievances against Charles&#39; government. There was a
tremendous unity of purpose amongst them. They knew that this time the King
could not afford to dissolve parliament if it opposed him. </p>
<p>When parliament met,
the initiative was immediately seized by John Pym who rapidly emerged as leader
in the House of Commons. He was a veteran of the battles in Parliament in the
1620s and knew exactly what he was doing. In an early speech he alleged the
existence of a plot to introduce popery and arbitrary government emanating from
some of the King&#39;s councilors. Early in the meeting of parliament in its first
session in November 1640 this allegation developed into direct attacks upon the
King&#39;s leading councilors, Archbishop Laud and Thomas Wentworth, the Earl of
Strafford. Both of them were imprisoned on the orders of parliament and
Strafford found himself the object of impeachment proceedings. Then in December
1640 parliament received, graciously, from the city of London a petition known
as the Root and Branch Petition against episcopacy in the church and calling
for further reformation in the church. It was accompanied by large
demonstrations of London citizens, orderly demonstrations accompanying the
petition to the parliament, but it showed how well London was organized in
opposition. In February 1641, after a brief recess, the Triennial Act was
passed and the King was reluctantly forced to agree to it. The Triennial Act
laid down that in future parliaments must be elected every three years and, a
few months later in May 1641, the King further agreed that the present parliament
could not be dissolved without its own consent. </p>
<p>The spring of 1641
also saw Strafford&#39;s impeachment proceedings in the House of Lords which
gradually turned into a trial of the entire regime of the 1630s, in particular
the exercise by the King of forms of arbitrary power, with Strafford&#39;s backing
according to the allegations. And in May 1641 Strafford was the object of an
act of attainder, the King was reluctantly forced to sign his death warrant,
and he was executed. Then in the summer of 1641 came a batch of reforming
statutes. The prerogative courts which had enforced the royal will in the
1630s, especially the Court of Star Chamber which had dealt with dissidents,
were abolished. Ship Money was declared illegal. The other financial
expedients which had been used by Charles in the 1630s were also declared
illegal, and to all of this the King reluctantly gave his assent. </p>
<p>By the high summer of
1641 then, it looked as if parliament had won. Charles&#39; innovations had been
reversed. Strafford, his strongman, was dead; Laud was in the Tower of London;
parliament had secured for itself a regular place in government through the
Triennial Act. It appeared to have been a bloodless, or almost bloodless,
constitutional revolution, but of course the game was not yet over. Parliament
went into recess in the summer of 1641 and Charles took the opportunity to
travel to Scotland. There he agreed to a settlement regarding the Church of
Scotland by withdrawing his earlier demands and this secured the withdrawal of
the Scottish army from the north of England. </p>
<p>In early November
1641 when parliament met again a second major event occurred. News arrived in
London of rebellion in Ireland, a Catholic and nationalist rebellion involving,
allegedly, massacres of English and Scottish settlers in northern Ireland. </p>
<p>Now I should take a
moment to explain briefly the Irish situation. In the aftermath of the
rebellion against Elizabeth by the Earl of Tyrone in the late 1590s, land had
been confiscated from the chieftains of northeastern Ireland, the area known as
Ulster, and that land had been planted with Protestant settlements mostly
peopled by settlers who came across from Scotland, southern Scotland, and from
England. Their relations with the Irish population were fraught from the
beginning. By 1641, some of the Irish chieftains in Ulster, resentful of their
loss of land and of power in that area, planned to imitate the Scots by
rebelling, seizing control of the Irish government, and then negotiating a
better settlement. Once the rebellion began, however, they proved unable to
control it. Some of their followers began killings of settlers and seizures of
their land. Meanwhile, the so-called Old English aristocracy of other parts of
Ireland, most of whom were Roman Catholics--they were descended from medieval
Norman conquerors of Irish land, known as the Old English--they joined in the
rebellion, principally motivated by the fact that as Roman Catholics they were
fearful of a Puritan-dominated parliament in London and what it might mean for
them. With the joining together of these two sources of discontent in Ireland
the rebellion became both a religious, a Roman Catholic, and a nationalist
rebellion fueled by bitter resentments against the plantations in the north,
marked by massacres and evictions of settlements. It&#39;s estimated--the figures
keep changing as more research is done, but perhaps 4,000 Protestant settlers
were killed and some thousands more probably died of cold and hunger during the
winter of 1641 to &#39;2. </p>
<p>So Ireland had
exploded, and news of these events, sometimes wildly exaggerated--bad enough as
it was--confirmed, it seemed to members of parliament, the fears that there was
indeed a popish plot afoot. But it also raised the crucial question of what was
to be done in the face of this new rebellion? Could the King be granted an
army to suppress it? Could he be trusted with an army? Would he not use it
first against parliament? On November the 23rd, 1641, John Pym decided to
press ahead. He introduced in to the House of Commons the so-called Grand
Remonstrance. It was a long document, a comprehensive indictment of Charles&#39;
misrule ever since he had come to the throne in 1625; all of these points set
out in order to justify the demand that henceforward parliament should have the
power to choose the King&#39;s councilors, thereby having control over whatever
forces might be granted to the King, and that an assembly of divines should
meet to determine the future structure of the Church of England to satisfy the
Puritan zealots amongst Pym&#39;s supporters. </p>
<p>This radical action
finally split what had been hitherto a fairly unified opposition to Charles. This
seemed to confirm the theory that there were indeed &quot;popular spirits&quot; seeking
to undermine the monarchy and the ancient constitution. So both of those conspiracy
theories which I mentioned last time seemed to have been confirmed by events. There
were also some members of parliament who, much as they opposed Laud&#39;s
innovations in the church, did not want a Puritan assault upon the episcopal
structure of the Church of England. That was going too far in their view. The
whole issue raised by the Grand Remonstrance--the many issues raised by it--were
passionately debated in a session which went on until two o&#39;clock in the
morning when it was finally passed by the House of Commons by only 159 votes to
148, a narrow victory for John Pym. He had the Grand Remonstrance printed and
distributed outside parliament into the country to win support. </p>
<p>So, with the Grand
Remonstrance what had been a virtually united opposition to the King was
dividing. And it was the fact that that once united opposition split that made
possible civil war. It made possible the King&#39;s rallying of a party to his
cause. On the 23rd of December, he rejected the Grand Remonstrance, and then
on the 4th of January 1642, he attempted a coup by coming in person to parliament
with troops to attempt to arrest the leaders of the House of Commons. The five
leaders that he was looking for escaped. They had been forewarned of his
arrival. They fled downriver and took refuge in the city of London. Faced
with this situation, Charles withdrew from his capital. Some members of parliament
were also withdrawing, quietly leaving parliament and going back to their
estates. Queen Henrietta Maria left and went to France to consult with her
brother, Louis XIII, and to raise money if possible to buy arms for a royal
army. </p>
<p>In June 1642--oh,
sorry, in March 1642--parliament passed an ordinance known as the Militia
Ordinance. An ordinance was not an act of parliament. A full act of parliament
needed the king&#39;s signature. They had decided to pass ordinances with the
force of law, to legislate without the King, and they passed the Militia
Ordinance, seizing the right to raise troops and appoint military commanders,
so they too were preparing to raise forces. In June 1642, they offered to the King
the so-called Nineteen Propositions. This included such terms as: all privy
councilors should in future be approved by parliament; all major officers of
state should be approved by parliament; the militia order allowing parliament
to raise troops and appoint commanders should be accepted; the King should
consent to whatever reform in the Church of England parliament advised. </p>
<p>Charles replied to
this ultimatum that if he was to accept this--I&#39;m quoting him--it would be &quot;the
total subversion of the fundamental laws and excellent constitution of this
kingdom,&quot; for, he continued, &quot;parliament never was intended for any share
in government or the choosing of them that governed.&quot; Now of course the King
was technically right, but things had passed beyond the question of what was or
what was not the excellent ancient constitution to which both sides continually
appealed. In different ways both sides of the dispute had now subverted the
ancient constitution which they professed to revere. And under the pressure of
events they had gradually entered completely uncharted waters, a situation
which no one had envisaged, let alone planned. </p>
<p>In July 1642, parliament
voted to raise an army. In August 1642, Charles, having rejected parliament&#39;s
terms, raised his banner in the city of Nottingham and called on all true
subjects to come to his support. In fact, by the time Charles raised the royal
standard at Nottingham fighting had already broken out in the town of
Manchester in the northwest where the townspeople resisted the attempts by one
of the King&#39;s supporters to seize the town&#39;s magazine of arms. The first shots
were fired that day. England was at war: at war with its own king and at war
with itself. </p>
<p>So, by the time civil
war broke out in July, August 1642, the combination of a determined effort to
reverse Charles I &#39;s policies in church and state and the unforeseen
circumstances provoked by the Irish rebellion had led parliament to make what
might reasonably be called revolutionary political claims. But how far would
it go and where would it end? Those questions were now to be settled by war,
and it was a war which itself unleashed a further dynamic of unforeseen
circumstances and unforeseen consequences. That continuing dynamic perhaps
derived ultimately from the complexity of the causes of the war and the various
meshings of motives which led people to fight and also from the remarkable
breadth of voluntary participation in the war. The participation in the
fighting was remarkably wide socially. It&#39;s been estimated that perhaps a
fifth of all adult men in the kingdom fought in the civil war. </p>
<p>Now historians have
long argued the toss about the real causes of the war--it&#39;s one of the great
debates of English historiography--and usually when they do so they try to
emphasize a particular dominant variable in their own interpretation. They
frequently seek for a single prime mover, the dominant cause. Really I think
that that&#39;s a foolish exercise, because the essential point it seems to me
about the civil wars is that they were about subtly different things to
different people who participated, and indeed all of the competing modern
interpretations--be they Whig or Marxist or revisionist--all of them can be
prefigured in the views of some contemporaries themselves. </p>
<p>Different people at
the time thought the war was about different things. To the Scots it was about
religion and the distinctive institutions of what was still an independent
kingdom even if it had the same king as the kingdom of England. To the Irish
it was about land and about religion. Amongst the English some royalists
joined the King simply out of loyalty. He was the King. Some saw themselves
as defending the monarch&#39;s legitimate constitutional rights against popular
spirits. Some saw themselves as defending the Church of England against a
Puritan plot to dismantle it. Some Roman Catholics joined the King--many of
them joined the King in fact--out of fear of what a Puritan victory might mean
and in the hope that if they supported the King he might grant them future
toleration in the exercise of their religion. Some gentlemen joined him
because they feared social disorder. They feared that a collapse of regular
government would lead to a breakdown of social order, a fear which was much
played upon by royalist propaganda which stressed the plebian nature of many of
those who had shown support for the parliament, the demonstrators in London for
example. Parliamentarians were early labeled by royalist propagandists as
Roundheads, people with short haircuts, which meant common people, not wearing
the flowing locks of a gentleman. </p>
<p>On the other side,
some parliamentarians saw themselves as defending the ancient constitution and
the law against a king who could not be trusted. If they had encroached on the
powers of Charles I, it was not because they were attacking monarchy as such. The
battle cry for the parliamentarian armies was &quot;for the King and parliament&quot; whereas
the war cry of the royalists was simply &quot;for the King,&quot; but the parliamentarian
slogan was &quot;King and parliament.&quot; Others saw themselves as defending English
Protestantism against popish innovation. Many banners of regiments raised in
the parliament&#39;s support had religious symbols upon them. Some saw it as the
moment at last at which they could move beyond the traditional Anglican
settlement and achieve a fuller reformation in church and nation. </p>
<p>Much intensive
research has been done on side taking, and it suggests that both socially and
geographically there were differences in the composition of the two sides, but
really they were just differences of degree; they were not absolutely clear
divisions. So, for example, two thirds of the House of Lords were for the King,
but one third of the lords fought for parliament; the earls of Manchester, of
Bedford, of Warwick, of Northumberland, and others fought for parliament. Most
of the gentry actually managed to stay out of it altogether, but of the very large
minority who did fight no significant difference can be found in terms of their
relative social and economic position. Where the differences can be discerned
they seem to have been differences of principle, sometimes religious principle,
sometimes constitutional principle. So this was a war in which many of those
who took part understood it as having a powerful ideological element of one
kind or another.</p>
<p>And much of this was
true also of the common people because they didn&#39;t participate simply as dutiful
tenants or impressed men. Of course, some did, but many voluntarily took part.
Predictably, the loyalties of the so-called &#39;middle sort of people&#39; counted
most, the kinds of people who were leaders in their townships and parishes, and
they seemed to have been moved by similar motivations to those of the gentry. Amongst
them we hear most in contemporary sources about a tendency to support parliament.
Most of them seem indeed to have been on that side. We mustn&#39;t forget that
these were people who also participated in local government, albeit at a humble
level. Many of them, if they had freehold land or were citizens of towns with
a broad franchise, had taken part in the elections. They were people who had
signed the county and municipal petitions which had been brought to the Long
Parliament in 1640. And amongst such people, amongst the middle sort as
contemporaries called them, one contemporary observer, Richard Baxter, tells us
there were many &quot;Good Commonwealth&#39;s Men,&quot; as he described them, concerned
about law, about taxation, about the liberties and survival of parliament,
though Baxter added that amongst them also were many who were sensible of these
things--I&#39;m quoting him--&quot;sensible of these things but much more sensible
of the interests of religion.&quot; Again ideological issues percolating far
down in society. As with the gentry, most of the middle sort of people did stay
out of it but of those who voluntarily participated a great many were for the parliament,
a mirror image of the aristocracy. And the major towns and industrial areas
were all parliamentarian in sympathy. So one could say if the royalist
propaganda of the early years of the war tended to be aristocratic in tone, a
good deal of the propaganda of the parliament was aimed broadly in society and
was somewhat populist in its tone. </p>
<p>So for many of the
middle sort too this was their cause also. But, be that as it may, they didn&#39;t
call the tune. Both sides of the war were directed by gentlemen, and in
approaching the actual events of the war it helps to consider what their war
aims were. The aims of the King and his advisers were simple. The King
intended to win and then dictate terms to a defeated parliament. To that end,
his basic strategy was to consolidate his control of territory in the north and
west of England where his supporters were in the majority and then to advance
upon London and take the city. Early in the war his principal base was
established on--in--Oxford and from Oxford he intended to advance to take
London. Simple enough. He almost achieved it in 1642 when some of his troops
arrived on the very outskirts of London and were turned back by armed
apprentices from the city who advanced to meet them at Turnham Green. The
royalists for whatever reason chose not to attack; they retreated and the city
was saved. (Turnham Green, incidentally, is on the tube line as you go in from
Heathrow Airport to central London. If you&#39;re ever going in that way on a
visit to London, you would go right through Turnham Green). </p>
<p>Not all who fought
for the King, however, shared these simple war aims. There were plenty amongst
them who had actually opposed him in 1640 but who couldn&#39;t bring themselves to
fight against him. They would have preferred a negotiated settlement, but
although Charles occasionally paused to engage in negotiations for tactical
reasons it&#39;s unlikely that he ever did it seriously. </p>
<p>The war aims of parliament
were different. Parliament neither sought nor expected an outright military
victory. The aim was to achieve a strategic superiority which would then force
the King to come to terms. The idea was to hold the south and the east and the
major cities where parliamentarian support was strongest, to contest the north
and the west in order to weaken the King, and above all to prevent the King
from taking London. Parliamentary armies were organized in regional
associations based on associations of counties who raised troops to operate
only within their own zone, in addition to which a field army was raised under
the command of the Earl of Essex which had the principal duty of protecting
London by shadowing royal forces in the Midlands. </p>
<p>So, the war consisted
for the most part of a great deal of regional skirmishing in the provinces and
local campaigning by one garrison against another all over the north and the
west and the Midlands; and then campaigns in which the major field armies
shadowed one another mostly in the south Midlands and in the approaches to
London with occasional pitched battles when London was seriously threatened. Such
was the basic situation in the first two years of the war from 1642 to 1644,
but as the war continued the experience of a conflict--of the conflict--and the
need to respond to the situations that it created began to release greater passions
and to create new war aims. </p>
<p>Militarily and
politically, the pattern was of summer military campaigns followed by winter
politics when the armies were simply encamped in winter quarters--and the
result of the summer campaign affected the politics; the result of the winter
politics affected the next summer campaign. That&#39;s how it went. In the summer
of 1643, the King came very close to winning again. He consolidated his
strength in the north and the west and seemed poised for a victorious strike. Politically,
parliament saw the emergence that winter of three broad groupings. There was a
peace group in parliament who thought it would be best to negotiate with the King
now and get the best terms that could be obtained before everything was lost. On
the other hand, there was a so-called war group. They had become convinced
that only a more aggressive military policy would succeed in bringing the King
to terms and they&#39;d have to defeat him militarily first before he would talk
seriously. And between the two was a large middle group which could be swayed
either way by debates in parliament. </p>
<p>Late in 1643, the war
group with the backing of John Pym, who at this time was actually dying of
cancer and had died by the end of the year, the war group decided that it was
necessary to try to bring the Scots back in, in order to break the royalists&#39;
hold on the north of England. And in September they negotiated the Solemn
League and Covenant with the Scottish Covenanters. It was agreed that the
Scots would aid parliament militarily, but the price of their support was
acceptance of reform of the Church of England &quot;according to the word of God and
the example of the best reformed churches.&quot; That was the wording of the treaty.
The Scots understood that to mean Presbyterianism. An assembly was set up at
Westminster of English divines, more than a hundred ministers, a number of lay
commissioners, and Scottish observers to discuss a future religious settlement.
Almost simultaneously, in the autumn of 1643, Charles agreed a cessation of
hostilities in Ireland. The Irish rebel confederation held power there. The
cessation of hostilities by the remaining royalist garrisons was achieved in
order to get aid for the King from the Irish rebel confederation. They would
bring in reinforcements from the west. All of this, both the bringing in of
the Scots and the bringing in of the Irish rebels, of course, inevitably
heightened the already existing sense of the war as being in part a religious
conflict. </p>
<p>1644 brought another
shift. The entry of the Scots facilitated parliament&#39;s recovery in the north. The
Scots swept south again, recovered Newcastle and began besieging the city of
York. Charles detached his nephew, Prince Rupert, to relieve the threat to
York which -- with--an army which proceeded north and expected an easy victory
in relieving the city. But he got quite a surprise. The Scots together with
the army of the Eastern Association, which was based in Cambridge and had men
from the eastern counties, advanced north to join the Scots and fought outside
York the great battle of Marston Moor at which the royalists under Prince
Rupert were utterly defeated. </p>
<p>The parliamentarian
victory was in particularly due to the role of the cavalry of the Eastern
Association, under the command of a figure who was rapidly emerging in the
parliamentary forces: Oliver Cromwell. And a brief word about Cromwell:
Cromwell was a squire of high birth but low means, a younger son who had been
MP for Cambridge in the Long Parliament and who had left parliament in order to
raise forces for the Eastern Association at the outbreak of war. He had
gradually risen from captain of a troop to colonel of a cavalry regiment. He
was a man who has been described as a man of &quot;agonies and exultations,&quot;
passionately religious, something of a depressive. He found himself in the
war, he found the cause he&#39;d been looking for, and his troops were known for
their training and their discipline. It was their conduct at Marston Moor, in
particular their capacity after a charge to rally, re-form, and charge again,
which had done a good deal to defeat the gallant but much less disciplined
royalist cavalry. </p>
<p>The total victory
which was achieved by the Scots and the Eastern Association at Marston Moor was
a considerable shock, the first complete parliamentarian victory. But the
momentum of that victory was squandered by the parliament&#39;s commanders in the
south. The indecisiveness and the incompetence of the senior commanders of the
south, the Earl of Essex and the Earl of Manchester, meant that the year ended
once again in stalemate. There was another indecisive holding battle to stop
the King reaching London at Newbury, while the Earl of Essex advanced down into
the west of England, got himself cornered and had to surrender and have his
troops ignominiously transported by sea back to the southeast having
surrendered their arms to royalist forces there. </p>
<p>The second Battle of
Newbury, holding the King back again from reaching London, brought to a head
the growing tension over parliament&#39;s war aims. Cromwell, who&#39;d hastened south
with his cavalry to join Manchester at Newbury, pressed the Earl of Manchester
to continue the battle to try to turn it in to the--a decisive victory. Manchester
refused to do so. It was enough for him to stop the King from advancing
further towards London. According to their recorded argument, Manchester
declared to Cromwell, &quot;if we beat the King ninety and nine times, yet he
is King still, and so will his posterity be after him, and we subjects still,
but if the King beat us once, we will all be hanged, and our posterity be made
slaves.&quot; In other words, he didn&#39;t dare risk a decisive battle. To which
Cromwell replied, &quot;why then, if this be so, why did we take up arms at
first?&quot; </p>
<p>The recriminations
continued bitterly in parliament during the winter resulting early in 1645 in a
victory for the war party in the House of Commons. First of all, they decided
to dissolve the existing parliamentarian field army and to form what was
described as a New Model Army which would be paid and controlled from
Westminster and would incorporate the best elements of all previously existing
parliamentarian forces and be free to operate wherever it was needed throughout
the kingdom. Secondly, they passed a Self-Denying Ordinance. The Self-Denying
Ordinance required the resignation of all commanders who were members of parliament.
It was a clever move to force the resignation of the incompetent aristocratic
leaders of the parliament&#39;s troops. But there was one exemption from the Self-Denying
Ordinance. Cromwell was exempted. His native military genius by now had shown
itself so clearly that he simply couldn&#39;t be spared. He was appointed Lieutenant
General of the Horse, not commander of the entire army. The Lord General was
Sir Thomas Fairfax, the leader of the parliament&#39;s cause in Yorkshire, Cromwell
was his Lieutenant General in command of the cavalry. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the war
conditions were having unanticipated consequences elsewhere. London was a city
in ferment. 1640 had seen the collapse of censorship of the press and a
proliferation of pamphlets arguing different political and religious ideas. Something
in the region of an average of 1,000 a year were being printed in London in the
early 1640s. The first newspapers were beginning to appear reporting on the
events of the war, ten a week by 1644. There had also been a collapse of
church discipline. Radical religious groups were emerging from underground and
meeting openly. New groups were forming in the debate over future religious
settlement. The city was highly politicized and awash with all kinds of
heterodox ideas. In 1646, a Presbyterian minister, Thomas Edwards, was so
shocked by the ideas that were circulating in London that he wrote his work <i>Gangraena</i>,
which was a three-volume catalog of heterodox opinions circulating in the city.
Edwards was an orthodox Calvinist utterly horrified at what had broken forth
and he was not alone. Many more conservatively minded members of parliament in
matters of religion began to favor a Scottish-style Presbyterian settlement
which would at least restore order and orthodoxy in matters of religion. And a
group of parliamentarian Presbyterians were able to push through acceptance of
a Directory of Worship which would replace the Anglican prayer book and to vote
in favor of a Presbyterian church structure to be imposed when the war was
over. </p>
<p>Others, however,
including Oliver Cromwell, were not alarmed by what seemed to be a new age of
the spirit in matters of religion. They favored independency:
congregationalism in church government. They were opposed to the imposition of
any form of coercion in matters of conscience. So in these debates going on in
London and in parliament religious liberty was emerging as an issue--and for
some people another aim of the conflict--which had not been previously
foreseen. It was in 1644 that pamphlets advocating religious toleration were
quite widely printed and it saw the printing of John Milton&#39;s great <i>Areopagitica</i>,
his wonderful statement in favor of freedom of speech and thought. </p>
<p>Equally worrying to
the more conservative members of parliament was the situation in the parliament&#39;s
army. Like the city, the army was a concentration of tens of thousands of
people in a mass situation, a most unusual social situation. The army was full
of volunteers. They were disproportionately men of Puritan inclination in
religion. Many of them were from London or East Anglia or the godlier areas of
the north and the Midlands. By 1644, Oliver Cromwell was already well known to
favor such godly men and to have a preference for promoting them on merit, a
shocking idea to seventeenth-century sensibilities. Famously he declared in
one argument over the promotion of a junior officer, &quot;I had rather have a
plain, russet-coated captain who loves what he fights for--who knows what he
fights for and loves what he knows, than that you call a gentleman who is
nothing else.&quot; </p>
<p>With the formation of
the New Model Army in 1645, all of these elements were brought together and it
took on a very distinctive character. The New Model, especially amongst its
junior officers, was full of Cromwell&#39;s russet-coated captains, who knew what
they fought for and loved what they knew, promoted on merit. It was a praying
army, a preaching army, a godly army, a surprisingly well-disciplined army by
the standards of the day. And in 1645 that spirit both contributed to and was
enhanced by victory--to seventeenth-century sensibilities the proof of God&#39;s
favor--and with victory came quite exceptional morale. </p>
<p>In June 1645, Fairfax
and Cromwell brought to battle and decisively defeated Charles&#39; main battle
army at Naseby in the central Midlands. They then rapidly moved west, cornered
the army of the--the royalist army of the west at Langport in Somerset, and
roundly defeated them. By late 1645 and early 1646, it had become largely a
matter of the army bottling up what remained of the King&#39;s forces in Oxford,
seizing and capturing the city of Bristol, and then mopping up the last
royalist opposition. By May of 1646, the King, seeing that there was no
possibility of military recovery, left Oxford in disguise, traveled north and
gave himself up to the Scots at Newark near Nottingham. He thought he&#39;d get
better terms from them.</p>
<p>So against all
initial expectations parliament had won an outright victory. Achieving that
victory, however, had released forces which could not easily be contained or
pushed back into the bottle. After one of the last skirmishes of 1646, the royalist
commander, Sir Alan Apsley, surrendered his sword to his parliamentarian
opponent, then sat down on a drum and is said to have said to the
parliamentarian officers, &quot;well, boys, you have done your work: now you
may go and play, unless perhaps you will fall out amongst yourselves.&quot; And that
was a very prescient remark, because the business of establishing the terms of
settlement, with the victory achieved, gradually turned in the next year into a
struggle over what was the meaning of the parliament&#39;s cause. And we&#39;ll turn
to that next time. </p>
