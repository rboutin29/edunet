<p><b>Professor Keith
Wrightson: </b>Right.
Okay. Well, today we return to the main political and ecclesiastical
narrative leading up to the--do you mind?--leading up to the outbreak of the
civil wars in the mid-seventeenth century. We left our discussion of the
Elizabethan church two weeks ago with the situation of relative calm at the end
of Elizabeth&#39;s reign. If you&#39;ll remember, the domestic threat posed by the
Catholic minority was diminishing. Puritan attempts to change the structure of
the church through action in Parliament had been defeated. And to a large
extent that relative stability can be said to have persisted in to the first
two decades of the seventeenth century, that is in to the reign of James I who
came to the throne in 1603 and died in 1625. </p>
<p>And indeed the
continuities between the end of Elizabeth&#39;s reign and the reign of James have
led some historians to speak of what they call a &quot;Jacobethan consensus&quot; in the
church during this generation; Jacobean plus Elizabethan, Jacobethan. The
characteristics of that consensus can be perhaps illustrated with reference to
an event at the very start of James&#39; reign. In 1603, as he made his way south
from Edinburgh to be crowned in London, he was presented with what&#39;s become
known as the Millenary Petition, getting that name from the fact that it was
allegedly subscribed by a thousand ministers of the Church of England. And it
revealed a body of opinion within the church petitioning James in the hope that
he would countenance further reform: further reform in doctrine, in the
ceremonies of the church, and in the quality of the clergy. </p>
<p>That led James to
call the Hampton Court Conference in 1604, which was a conference of leading
churchmen in which all strands of opinion were represented. In the course of
the conference, James was very forthright in insisting that he would not countenance
any change in the episcopal government of the Church of England. Twice in the
course of the debates he intervened famously with the phrase &quot;No bishop,
no King.&quot; He&#39;d had quite enough of the semi-independent Presbyterian
Church of Scotland. So discussion of church government in that sense was not
on the agenda. Still it wasn&#39;t a confrontation between James and the Puritan
wing of the Church of England. He was very comfortable with the godly issues
that were raised. He was very keen on steps to improve the learning and
quality of the clergy. He agreed that there should be a new English
translation of the Bible, the one eventually published in 1611 known in Britain
as the Authorized Version or here as the King James Bible. And everyone was
very impressed with the King&#39;s doctrinal knowledge. He had had a very thorough
theological education in Scotland. There was no question in other words that
James was a godly prince. He was England&#39;s Solomon, as they flatteringly
termed him. </p>
<p>So the Hampton Court
Conference revealed the existence of continuing differences, differences of
opinion about aspects of the Church of England&#39;s structure, but there was a
great deal of common ground and the conference broke up pretty amicably. Let&#39;s
look at that common ground a little closely -- a little more closely. First of
all, there was by the early seventeenth century an essential consensus over
doctrine. Since the late 1580s, most theologians in the universities had been
interpreting the ambiguities of the Elizabethan settlement in an essentially
Calvinist way. They tended to accept the doctrine of predestination, the view
that God had predestined those who would be amongst the elect and those who
would be reprobate or damned at the Last Judgment. They also had a widely
shared model of the ideal godly Protestant devotional life based on Biblicism,
attendance at sermons, the practice of household devotions, and a strict &#39;godly
conversation&#39;, as they called it; that is, strict personal behavior, strict
moral behavior in daily life. </p>
<p>All of this was
supported by a growing vernacular religious literature which tended to support
this approach to religious life. They also shared a common view of the need to
entrench Protestant doctrine and reformed behavior in the population at large. Only
a minority might be saved according to Calvinist doctrine, but no one knew for
sure who they were. Therefore, the church must address the whole population,
it must serve the whole population, and it should minister to them. It&#39;s interesting
for example that when the 1611 translation was being prepared by a committee of
divines, when they&#39;d settled on a translation of a passage, they used to read
it aloud to see if it would be effective when read aloud to illiterate
congregations. They were very conscious of the need to be able to communicate
in that kind of way. </p>
<p>Well, to that end a
great deal of stress was placed on the provision of a godly pastorate of
teaching, preaching ministers. And, as we saw when looking at education, a great
deal was in fact achieved in that respect. By the early 1600s, there was also
an unmistakable Protestant identity. Despite internal differences of opinion,
most people were conscious of their common membership of a Protestant
confessional family within Europe. Their feelings of religious hostility were
directed outwards towards the threat of what they usually described not as
Catholicism but as &quot;Popery.&quot; Popery was the supposed antithesis of reformed
religion, characterized as a church which was based not on the pure,
unvarnished word of scripture but on human errors, corrupted by false doctrine
and superstitious practices, and increasingly seen as alien. </p>
<p>Okay. Well, there&#39;s
a good deal to be said for this notion of a Jacobethan consensus in the generation
which spanned the last years of Elizabeth and the reign of James. But, if the
church was indeed at relative peace it was enjoying a period of stability that
was in many ways fragile. One mustn&#39;t overdo the element of consensus, and by
the 1620s there was increasing evidence of that consensus being subject to
destabilizing forces. And there were two of them in particular to emphasize. First
of all, there was the process of what one can call Puritan reformation down in
the parishes, and secondly there was the Arminian reaction at the center, and
I&#39;ll look at each of these in turn. </p>
<p>Well starting with
the Puritans. The Puritans, as we&#39;ve already seen, were those that
contemporaries thought of as, in the phrase of the time, the &quot;hotter sort of
Protestants.&quot; Those who were most committed to furthering the reformation. And
by furthering the reformation they meant not simply conformity to a Protestant
religious settlement; they also had the ambition of galvanizing the religious
life of the whole nation. As one of them put it, they sought &quot;a reduction of
all things disordered,&quot; be it in religion or in social morality, a reduction of
it to the model of God&#39;s requirements as revealed in scripture, as they saw it.
These were of course people of fervent faith and astringent personal religious
life. It&#39;s best revealed in the way they monitored their own lives in the
spiritual diaries that they often kept, straining by examination of their own
behavior to achieve the sanctification of personal life which would give them
assurance of their election. Assurance that they were amongst the elect, those
who would be saved; an assurance which often simply didn&#39;t come to many of
them, but they kept struggling. </p>
<p>And that struggle
bred a kind of spiritual anxiety which perhaps underlay their often vigorous
activism. They sought reassurance often in action. These were not just formal
members of the church living their lives within a general framework of
Christian belief and practice. They were seriously religious people and their
religion shaped their whole lives. The trouble was that it not only shaped
their lives but not infrequently impacted also on the lives of others. Amongst
the clergy those of puritanical inclination were amongst the most conscientious
and the most active in the task of evangelizing the people. Whatever their
private preferences as to forms of church government, most of them had long ago
abandoned any serious attempt to transform the church by political action. They&#39;d
withdrawn from that after the 1580s. Instead they conformed more or less to
the requirements of the church for the sake of the larger task of spreading the
word; evangelizing. </p>
<p>Protestantism seemed
to them to demand popular enlightenment. It demanded a dispelling of what they
viewed as the darkness of popish ignorance and superstition, and godly
ministers entered upon that task with very high expectations. When one reads
their works they often speak initially of the mass of the population as &quot;hungry
sheep unfed.&quot; They describe them as &quot;fields of corn ripe for the harvest&quot; or
they&#39;re &quot;babes crying for the milk of good doctrine,&quot; and what could stand
against the word if it was brought to them? Unfortunately for that optimistic
position, they often found that their own parishioners tended to disappoint
their high hopes of evangelical success. </p>
<p>A parish ministry day
by day, week by week, year by year, could often be a deeply disillusioning
experience. Richard Greenham, who was one of the most famous of the early
Puritan preachers--he was the minister of Dry Drayton near Cambridge, a man
much sought after for advice by other Puritans--Richard Greenham finally
resigned his living at Dry Drayton after twenty years of effort, effort which
had him not only preaching on Sundays and on weekdays but even going out and
standing by the fields as his parishioners went out to work on their farms to
talk to them about matters of religion and so forth. After twenty years of
this effort, he gave up because of what he called &quot;the untractableness and
unteachableness of that people.&quot; </p>
<p>And there gradually
grew up in the early decades of the seventeenth century alongside the
literature of sermons and devotional works, what one can perhaps describe as a
literature of godly disillusionment, in which people reflected upon their lack
of success in the evangelizing movement. And such literature very often
contained a very somber assessment of the state of popular religion in England,
and I&#39;ll give you some quotations from the kind of things they tended to say. They
were deeply concerned about the fact that the people were ignorant of doctrine,
uninstructed in what they saw as saving doctrinal knowledge. To give some
examples from these works: &quot;the poor people do not understand so much as
the Lord&#39;s Prayer.&quot; &quot;If any question be put to them as concerning religion,
they grow as mute as fishes.&quot; &quot;Men can talk understandingly about
ways of the world, but they can scarcely speak a word of sense about matters of
salvation.&quot; &quot;Our sermons are but a breath from us and a sound to
them&quot;--because they didn&#39;t understand the half of it. </p>
<p>These are all
quotations from works of this kind. They said that the religion of the people
remained one of &quot;formality and blind devotion.&quot; That&#39;s a common phrase, &quot;formality
and blind devotion,&quot; reliance upon a ritualistic repetition of one&#39;s prayers;
turning up at church services more as a gathering of neighbors than as a
congregation of the faithful; more concerned with who they saw at church than
with what they heard; and confident that this was enough, that this was a good
life, which in the eyes of the godly ministers, of course, it wasn&#39;t. The
people were &#39;superstitious&#39;. They still adhered to practices which they were
too ignorant to recognize as being hangovers from the dark age of popery. They
practiced magic, they visited cunning folk, and they were &quot;profane&quot; people who
did not appreciate the need to sanctify their lives according to the word of
God and who maintained forms of customary behavior offensive to God. </p>
<p>They swore; they
drank to excess; they indulged in what one minister described as &quot;light, lewd,
and lascivious dancing;&quot; they broke the Sabbath either by working in their
farms and workshops or by their leisure activities; hanging out in the ale
house as soon as they got out of church. As one preacher put it, &quot;every
parish hath a profane and ignorant multitude who are born with a pope in their
belly,&quot; by which he meant they were directed by their fleshly appetites--&quot;born
with a pope in their belly are not yet redeemed from that gross supervision--superstition--and
vain conversation which they have received by tradition from their
fathers.&quot; In short, they were prisoners of popular custom rather than
followers of the precept of scripture.</p>
<p>But there was a
remedy for all of this and these condemnatory jeremiads tended to be followed
rapidly by calls for the pursuit of reformation of these disorders by a dual
policy, a policy of &quot;word and sword.&quot; Ministers and secular magistrates,
whether they be parish officers or justices of the peace, the leaders of towns
or parliamentary members, they should all act together. The word of the
minister would &quot;reform the inside&quot; of the people; the sword of the magistrate
would &quot;conform the outside&quot;; word and sword. </p>
<p>Well, such recommendations
didn&#39;t fall on deaf ears, and where godly ministers and like-minded local
officers and magistrates supported one another, as they sometimes did, this
kind of answer to the cultural failings of the reformation, its failings to
adequately communicate with the people down in the parishes, led to what&#39;s been
characterized as widespread cultural conflict in the early seventeenth century,
right down at the level of the locality. </p>
<p>Many forms of
customary popular culture in the parishes were attacked. Feasts and
festivities, Sunday dancings and so forth were often put down partly because
they were held on the Sabbath day, partly because they tempted people to
profane behavior, notably drunkenness and the incitement of lust. One study by
Ronald Hutton in <i>The Rise and Fall of Merry England </i>shows how gradually
these traditional feasts and festivals disappeared all over southeastern
England and were gradually retreating into the north and west where they
continued to survive. There was also widespread attack, at local level, upon such
things as the numerous alehouses which the people frequented--many of them were
suppressed--and at such common everyday sins as profane swearing, for example
swearing &quot;By God&quot; in the course of conversation. The arrest book for
the town of Dorchester, which was dominated by a Puritan group from the 1610s
onwards, is quite interesting on market days. It reveals numerous cases of
people arrested on market day for swearing in the marketplace, or for getting
drunk in the taverns around the market. That was a field day for reformation. </p>
<p>As a result, some
communities became well known as models of godly discipline. Often they were
small towns, places like Banbury in Oxfordshire, which was known for what was
described, approvingly, as its &quot;precise course of government,&quot; its imposition
locally of stricter standards of reformation. Or Dorchester in Dorset, which
I&#39;ve already mentioned, under its patriarch, John White, or indeed
Stratford-on-Avon in Warwickshire, where the local Puritan group triumphed
after a sharp tussle with their opponents: the opponents in fact including a
number of friends and associates of the retired playwright William Shakespeare.
</p>
<p>Other communities
remained uneasily divided. They were prone to occasional eruptions of conflict
brought on by reforming initiatives: local attempts to tighten up on standards
of church attendance, to put down ale houses or whatever was the case, and
there might be no lasting victory, just a continuing tussle between the two
sides. Still others remained relatively untouched. </p>
<p>A number of
historians have looked at all of this and tried to interpret its broader
implications. David Underdown, for example, in the study of what was going on
in the west of England, has speculated about the possible association between
different local social and economic structures and different degrees of
proneness or susceptibility to the outbreak of this kind of religious conflict.
He asks why some places seem to have been able to exclude such conflict,
whereas others were deeply divided and riven by it. Why did the Puritan word
take root so much better in some places than in others? </p>
<p>In the east of
England, especially the counties of East Anglia, where the Puritans very much
called the tune by the second quarter of the seventeenth century, a number of
scholars, William Hunt, myself and others, have suggested that religious
impulses for reformation and greater discipline were superimposed in these
areas upon other forms of social tension; that the Puritan ministers tended to
win their converts principally amongst what were known as the better sort of
parishioners, the more prosperous leaders of the parish, the more literate
people, and that local struggles were aimed primarily at disciplining the poor
and the young of their communities. In other words that religious anxieties
and social anxieties reinforced one another, one mutating into the other. </p>
<p>Still others have
insisted that the whole thing was purely a religious matter, that if there was
a corrugation or a segmenting of local populations according to one or another
religious persuasion, it was simply a matter of the introduction of particular
religious messages and the intensity with which those beliefs were held in
particular places. </p>
<p>So there are
different takes on the unevenness of Puritan success, but what one can say in
general is that it was very uneven. Nevertheless, all agree that such conflict
existed in many parishes, in many towns and it was all part and parcel of the
local history of the reformation in its most advanced form. Obviously, it
depended first and foremost upon the communication of the demand for a more
stringent reformation into the localities. Those places which were least
troubled by all this were those where these demands were never heard. There
was never a minister of Puritan persuasion, or a town council of Puritan
persuasion, there to instigate such reformatory programs. For whatever reason
they found no local constituency of supporters. But the outcome, where conflict
did break out, tended to depend crucially on whether the &#39;godly&#39; or those who
resisted them had most control in local decision-making power. Town councils,
parish vestries and so forth and who controlled them were often crucial to the
success or failure of these reformatory movements. It&#39;s all part of the way
that the long-term outcome of the reformation and the long-term development of
the nature of English Protestantism was being settled and fought out in
dispersed, diffuse actions taking place all over the kingdom, though rather
more common in some parts of the kingdom than in others. And gradually, by the
1620s, it gave rather different complexions to the Church of England in
different localities. East Anglia was predominantly Puritan. One survey of
the ministers of the three counties of East Anglia for example reveals that by
the 1630s two thirds of them could be described as Puritan in inclination. This
was a great area of Puritan strength. There were other counties also which
shared that. The north and the west tended to see much less Puritan activity.
Other counties were much divided. </p>
<p>And in the course of
it all the term &quot;Puritan&quot; acquired a new layer of meaning. Within the
Jacobean church Puritans could not easily be distinguished by their theology,
they couldn&#39;t easily be distinguished by their ethical teachings--both of them
were essentially mainstream. But what did distinguish them was their intensity
and their activism. They were defined in a sense by a godly activism which,
when it was unleashed in a particular local context, tended to maximize stress
over religious issues. That&#39;s where they got defined, in such contexts. No
one chose to call himself a Puritan; it was a term of abuse. They were labeled
as Puritans by their opponents in such conflictual contexts. As Patrick
Collinson, one of the greatest historians of Puritanism, has put it, Puritanism
was &quot;not a thing definable in itself.&quot; It was &quot;one half of a stressful
relationship.&quot; &quot;One half of a stressful relationship&quot;--the relationship that
arose in some parishes through the impact on local society of the fervent
pursuit of reformation. </p>
<p>Okay. Let&#39;s turn now
to the other destabilizing group, the Arminians. And before we go any further
with this let me stress Arminians, A-r-m-i-n, not Armenians. Every year when
we have the examination sinister groups of Armenians turn up destabilizing the
Church of England. [Laughter] There was indeed an Armenian
community in northwestern Europe at this time. They were vitally important in
the trade networks which linked northwestern Europe to the east and they were
there. But they had nothing whatever to do with the troubles of the Church of
England. So &quot;Arminians.&quot;</p>
<p>The Arminians were
another minority who occasioned a good deal of conflict in the early Stuart
church, but this time they can be defined more easily in terms of theology. Theologically,
they comprised a minority of English churchmen who rejected Calvinism. They
rejected the Calvinist doctrine of predestination. Rather than believing that
only the elect were predestined to salvation, they believed, more traditionally,
in the universality of God&#39;s grace and in the free will of all mankind to
choose salvation. So they&#39;re theologically distinct. They had their
antecedents in the late sixteenth century amongst those theologians who did not
interpret the Thirty Nine Articles in a Calvinist manner but remained closely--closer--to
more traditional teaching and indeed to Lutheran teaching in their views. </p>
<p>In the early seventeenth
century, they came to be labeled &#39;Arminians&#39; after a Dutch theologian who took
this position, Arminius of Leiden. His criticism of Calvin was deemed so
important at the time that it was a subject of a major conference of the
reformed churches, the Synod of Dort, which met in 1618 at which Arminius&#39;
teachings were denounced. But Arminianism also existed amongst a minority of
English churchmen and it had certain distinctive features in England. In the
Netherlands, Arminius was operating within the context of the Dutch Reformed
Church with its Congregational structure. The English Arminians existed in the
context of a church with a traditional Episcopal system of church government
and a highly traditional form of prayer book ceremonial. The English Arminians
tended to link their belief in the doctrine of free grace to other beliefs
connected to the structure of the Church of England. They believed in
episcopacy, not simply as a form of church government amongst many others but
as a divinely sanctioned form of church government. They were very keen on the
structure of hierarchical authority in the church. They were also very keen on
the sacraments as a means of grace, as a way of coming to God. For example,
they restored the significance of the altar, rather than of the communion table,
and the significance of the communion service as something more than just a
commemoration of Christ&#39;s sacrifice. They tended to play down preaching,
preaching so dear to the heart of Puritans as the essential means of communication.
Arminians tended to play down preaching and to place more emphasis, as an
element in worship, upon ritual, upon the performance of the sacraments. They
spoke of the beauty of holiness. They thought that participation, reverent
participation, in services and rituals of great beauty, had a spiritual
function. </p>
<p>They also had a very
high notion of the dignity of the priesthood. They were very clericalist in
that sense, and their most prominent spokesmen were leading clerics; people
like Lancelot Andrewes, the Bishop of Winchester, Bishop Richard Neile, the
Bishop of Durham, and above all William Laud. All of these names are on your
handout. William Laud, who started as an Oxford academic, was Master of St.
John&#39;s College, Oxford, and later moved on to be Dean of Gloucester Cathedral
and then to other higher offices in the church as I&#39;ll describe. </p>
<p>The Arminians were a
minority even amongst the bishops of the church under James I. That became
clear at the very end of James&#39; reign in 1624 when Richard Montagu, an Arminian
who was the Dean of St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral in London, published his non-Calvinist
interpretation of the Church of England&#39;s Thirty Nine Articles of Religion. This
publication by Montagu was widely attacked. Indeed, he was reproved and his
interpretation was rejected by the Archbishop of Canterbury himself, who was
doctrinally a Calvinist. </p>
<p>To most members of
the church at this point in time, the beliefs and the practices of worship
which were favored by the Arminians looked very suspicious. They looked like
backsliding. They looked like backsliding towards Rome, and indeed although
the Arminians were undoubtedly Protestants, they were very much closer to
traditional Catholic teaching in many respects, including the fact that they
regarded the Catholic church itself as being a true church, albeit a corrupted
one, rather than seeing it as in fact the work of Antichrist, which was the
conventional extreme Protestant interpretation. </p>
<p>Well, all of this
might have just remained a matter for theological debate at the academic level
if it hadn&#39;t been for two facts. First of all, some of the Arminians were of a
singularly combative and authoritarian frame of mind. They were equal in their
determination to impose their will to any of the most fervent Puritans, whom on
the whole they detested. And secondly in the 1620s the Arminians succeeded in
winning over to their side the young Prince Charles, the future Charles I. He
was persuaded by people of Arminian convictions that their brand of religion
was more suited to a monarchy. He liked it. </p>
<p>Well, in 1625 Charles
came to the throne on the death of James I and, as head of the church, he
rapidly seized the opportunity to advance Arminians in the church and to
exclude Calvinists. And it all happened remarkably quickly. In 1626, the Duke
of Buckingham, Charles&#39; favorite and mentor, was appointed chancellor of the
University of Cambridge where he used his power as chancellor to forbid the
teaching of predestination. In 1627, William Laud and Richard Neile were
appointed to the royal privy council, a very unusual move. It had been rare for
even the highest clerics to be admitted to the center of power in that kind of
way. But Charles did it. In 1628, Charles as supreme head of the church insisted
that an Arminian interpretation of the Thirty Nine Articles of Religion, the
same interpretation which had been denounced when put forward only four years
earlier, was the only valid interpretation. </p>
<p>In the same year
William Laud was promoted to be Bishop of London. That was a crucial office,
not only presiding over the metropolis, of course, but it was also an office
which gave the bishop the power to control the licensing of all books which
were printed and published in London. And Laud used that power of control of
the press to further his own views and to silence his critics by refusing
licenses for the publication of their works. In 1630, Laud was appointed
Chancellor of the University of Oxford with predictable results as regards
theological teaching at Oxford. In 1632, Richard Neile was appointed
Archbishop of York, governing the northern province of the church. And finally
in 1633 on the death of his predecessor, George Abbot, Laud was appointed
Archbishop of Canterbury. </p>
<p>So, in only eight
years the Arminians, with Charles&#39; help, had captured the Church of England;
they held all the most important positions. If Puritan activism in the
parishes had done a good deal to disturb the localities and to create tensions
over religion down in the provinces, the Arminian victory in the church utterly
shattered the Jacobethan consensus within which Puritan evangelists in the
localities had been able to shelter. William Laud simply detested Puritans. More
than that, he detested Calvinists and he defined all Calvinists as Puritans. He
drove them together out of their shared hostility to what to them seemed to be
innovations in the church, alien innovations which were suspiciously popish
looking, a program of change in the church which filled them with dread. </p>
<p>All of this served,
from both sides, to politicize religion at the national level in a way that
really hadn&#39;t been known since the 1580s. In 1626, Laud had preached a sermon
to Parliament, when it met, alleging the existence of a Puritan and Presbyterian
conspiracy to undermine the Church of England from within, and he denounced all
those who didn&#39;t share his own views as being Puritan subversives. In 1628,
many members of Parliament, when it met again, reciprocated by condemning Laud
and the Arminian innovations which had been introduced in the meantime, and
they began indulging in their own name calling. One member of the House of
Commons, Francis Rous, declared &quot;an Arminian is but the spawn of a papist.&quot;
In the House of Lords, the Earl of Bedford, a Puritan aristocrat, described
Arminians as, to quote him, &quot;the little thief put in at the window of the
church to unlock the door.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The little thief put
in at the window of the church to unlock the door.&quot; To unlock the door to
whom? To popery of course, and its European champions whose successes in the
1620s in the Thirty Years War, which had been raging in Europe since 1618, just
exacerbated the sense of English Protestants of being embattled against
powerful enemies and exposed to a resurgent Counter Reformation Catholicism. The
war which was going on in Germany was in fact immensely complex in its origins,
but to outside observers it looked like an essentially religious struggle, and
in the 1620s the armies of Spain fighting against the Netherlands and the
armies of the Austrian emperor, a Catholic of course, were winning and seemed
to be driving back Protestantism in Germany. All this fueled the paranoia of
those who observed it all from outside. </p>
<p>Well, the rise of
feeling of that kind should have warned Charles I. It would almost certainly
have warned his shrewd and canny father, King James. But Charles appears to
have been indifferent to the polarization of opinion. He lacked his father&#39;s
political good sense and he allowed William Laud to press ahead. Between 1630
and 1632, when he was Bishop of London, Laud was extremely active in East
Anglia, part of which fell under the bishopric of London, in rooting out
Puritans, in calling them before him to be examined on their beliefs, in suspending
them, indeed in ejecting them from the church. Many of them joined the
migration to New England, sometimes taking key members of their congregations
with them. The Minister of Terling in Essex for example, a parish--little
parish--down in central Essex, left when browbeat--after being browbeaten--by Laud
and deprived of his living and took with him thirteen members of his community.
They founded Roxbury, Massachusetts. </p>
<p>In 1633, once he had
become Archbishop of Canterbury, Laud ordered that communion tables should be
removed from their position close to the center of the chancel and they should
be placed at the east end of the church like altars, suitably dressed in
appropriate cloths, and railed in to create a holy space at the east end of the
chancel. This was anathema to Puritans, but he required it, and he used his
metropolitan visitation as archbishop to demand conformity to this new
ritualism in every church. Church wardens who refused to obey were hauled
before him and sometimes punished. In 1633, he also issued what was known as
the Book of Sports, a declaration in the King&#39;s name that traditional sports,
festivities and leisure activities would be permitted upon Sundays, and every
minister was ordered to read it out in his church. This again was anathema to
Puritan ministers. Many refused to do it and they were punished and deprived
of their livings. </p>
<p>Altogether,
throughout the Arminian controlled church, a new and stricter definition of the
nature of Anglican conformity was being rigorously enforced by Laud, and he had
a very sharp way indeed of dealing with dissidents. Three of the most famous
dissidents who smuggled in anti-Arminian books from the Netherlands to escape Laud&#39;s
censorship of the press, were arrested in 1637, &#39;38, and severely punished by Laud
acting from the Court of Star Chamber of which he was a leading member. They
were pilloried; they had their ears slit off, for example. </p>
<p>And the result of all
this? Well, one result was a far more rapid growth of the Puritan colonies in
New England than would otherwise have been the case. Thousands of the most
dedicated of the Puritan clergy and groups of their lay followers finally
despaired of England, despaired of the hope of reformation in this context and
left to create a godly commonwealth of their own in the New World. </p>
<p>And within England?
Well, it&#39;s possible that in some, perhaps many, parishes some aspects of Laud&#39;s
Arminian policies were perhaps not unwelcome. One could say that it was a way
of putting an end to the parochial controversy and reasserting order and
discipline in the church. Some may well have welcomed that. It offered a
doctrine of salvation which was somewhat easier and more generous than
Calvinist predestination, perhaps closer to the needs and understandings of
simple folk. And perhaps the brand of religious practice focused on the prayer
book and the sacraments which was something which might be more inclusive at
the level of the parish, less individually demanding on the population. </p>
<p>Perhaps. All these
positive features have been suggested in an interesting book by Judith Maltby
on attitudes towards the Prayer Book in this period. But in many parishes it
was also the case that the policies of William Laud and the Arminians
themselves brought conflict. There was widespread alarm at their ceremonial
innovations. There was widespread suspicion of their ultimate intentions. There
was widespread resentment and frustration amongst the godly folk who remained
in English parishes that the reformation had been stopped, that perhaps it was
being reversed before it had even been half won. </p>
<p>That in itself was a
new cause for discontent, a new cause for controversy, a new cause for what
have been called &quot;street wars of religion.&quot; A source of increased bitterness
in such controversies, a bitterness which spilled over into political life,
sharpening and intensifying other sources of conflict which were coming to
light between the royal government and members of the political nation. And
it&#39;s to those other sources of conflict that I&#39;ll turn next time. </p>
