<p><b>Professor Keith Wrightson: </b>Okay. Well, in 1921 a
group of workmen working on the highway near the village of St. Osyth, which is
here in Essex, in East Anglia, discovered a skeleton. And at first they thought
they&#39;d uncovered a modern crime, but it was soon established that it was very
old. And subsequently, on the basis of both documentary evidence and forensic
evidence, they identified it as being probably the remains of a woman named
Ursula Kemp who had been executed at St. Osyth and buried in the highway,
rather than in consecrated ground, in the year 1582. And Ursula Kemp&#39;s crime
was the alleged causing of death by witchcraft. Now today, obviously, I&#39;m going
to talk about witchcraft and perhaps explain how it was that people like Ursula
Kemp came to such an end. </p>

<p>First of all we need to start with a little
context by discussing the larger place of not simply witchcraft, a specific
crime, but magic within the popular culture of early modern England. We could
perhaps define that world of magic as being essentially a body of beliefs, a
large body of beliefs, and practices regarding supernatural power which stood
outside the world of formal religion and yet were widely known and helped people
to cope with their anxieties and their insecurities. It helped them to cope
above all because it involved various ritual means of manipulating supernatural
powers so as to ward off misfortune or else to alleviate it. </p>

<p>This world of magic, then, was essentially a
world of trying to propitiate or to manipulate unidentified supernatural
powers, largely for the purposes of protection and relief. It wasn&#39;t--and it&#39;s
important to stress this--it wasn&#39;t an alternative religion. It was a whole
mess of supplementary beliefs and practices, being described by one historian
as &quot;the debris of many different systems of thought.&quot;<sup>1</sup>
It was regarded with some suspicion by the church, but it was not regarded as
a threat as such, at least not initially. One historian writing about popular
beliefs has put it splendidly. I&#39;m quoting from him. The name&#39;s James
Obelkevich. &quot;It was a large, loose, pluralistic affair without any clear
unifying principle. It encompassed superhuman beings and forces, witches and
wise men and a mass of low-grade magical and superstitious practices. The
whole was less than the sum of its parts&quot;--the whole was less than the sum of
its parts -- &quot;for it was not a cosmos to be contemplated or worshipped but a
treasury of separate and specific resources to be used or applied in concrete
situations.&quot; That puts it extremely well.<sup>2</sup>
</p>

<p>These means of tapping into supernatural
power were very widely known. You could say they were part of the lore which
was acquired by every child as part of their education for life, like learning
to cross the road as it were. But the world of magic also had its specialists
and they were those who were known as the &#39;cunning folk&#39;, &#39;cunning men&#39;, or
&#39;wise women&#39;. These individuals were those who were known to have special
knowledge over and above the average knowledge of magical practices and who
often believed to have a special inherent power, often inherited. It was
thought to pass in the blood. The cunning folk who were pretty numerous--one
survey of known cunning folk in East Anglia suggests that there was a known
cunning man or wise woman within ten miles of any village--these people were
appealed to for a variety of specific purposes.</p>

<p>In the first place, they often were appealed
to for medical reasons. Very often they had specialist knowledge of herbs
which they would administer often accompanied by spells to increase their
effectiveness--the psychological effect of the incantation going along with
what may well have been the practical effect of the herbs they used. Ursula
Kemp for example was such a person. She was known as a healer in her village. She
was good at curing arthritis apparently. Again, they were appealed to for the
diagnosis of witchcraft. If a person suspected that they might have been
bewitched, they might go to the cunning folk for the provision of
counter-magic. They might help the victim to identify who might have attacked
them in this occult manner and advise on counteraction. </p>

<p>One of my favorite cunning men came from a
town in the north of England, Stokesley, and he was called John Wrightson, and
he was known as Old Wrightson the Wise Man of Stokesley, and people went to him
for help with their horses. He was a horse leech. He was very good at telling
whether your horse had been bewitched and knowing how to take the appropriate
countermeasures. </p>

<p>People went to the cunning folk also for the
recovery of lost or stolen goods and they went for advice and the telling of
fortunes, and to this extent the wise women and the cunning men were the
popular equivalent of the astrologers who had a more elite clientele in this
period. </p>

<p>So, the cunning folk provided a variety of
real services and the best of them may well have been quite skilled therapists
in their way. One historian of medical practice in this period says we ought
to count them amongst the medical practitioners of the time. They were cheap,
they were available and in many ways quite knowledgeable. However, the church
was pretty unhappy about this kind of activity. It didn&#39;t like popular magic. The
official teaching of the church was that if a person suffered any misfortune it
must be the result of divine providence. It was either a test of your faith or,
on the other hand, it was a judgment on your sin. The only proper response to
misfortune was to search one&#39;s own heart for the possible causes of such divine
intervention: to pray, to repent, to trust in God&#39;s providential purposes. </p>
<p>The church rejected magical means of relief. It
accepted the possibility, but it rejected the means. God could not be
commanded by spells and incantations, therefore, if there was any supernatural
response to such practices it must be from evil spirits. </p>
<p>And so, given these beliefs, we find the
deeply pious of the period searching their hearts for the sins which had
brought misfortune upon them and sometimes finding quite extraordinary answers.
You find it in their diaries for example. For example, the diary of the
Reverend Ralph Josselin, a minister in the late seventeenth century, who,
having lost a dearly loved daughter, searched his heart as to why God should
have done this, why he should have taken her away, and came to the conclusion
that it was because he had neglected his clerical duties because of his
enthusiasm for playing chess. He had played chess too much; God had taken his
daughter. That&#39;s the conclusion he came to and he gave up playing chess. This
is a seventeenth-century God, not a nice, modern, user-friendly, God. [Laughter]
</p>

<p>Little wonder then, if these were the
official teachings of the church, that the greater part of the population
preferred to explain their misfortunes in terms of just bad luck, or their
neglect of protective magic, or perhaps the malevolence of evil spirits and
malicious neighbors. Well, this world of popular magic had long existed and it
was long to endure. You can find much of it still alive and well deep into the
nineteenth century. And it endured because in various ways it helped. </p>

<p>But the problem of witchcraft is altogether
more distinctive. That involved a specific kind of magic: the causing of
injury or death by the malevolent and malicious use of supernatural powers
against another or their property. And that was the practice which was known
as <i>maleficium</i>. That&#39;s the Latin legal term which was used for this
maleficent magic. And concern with witchcraft in this way had a quite distinct
chronology. The possibility of malevolent magic had always been there, of
course, but concern with it was undoubtedly at an unusual height in the late
sixteenth and earlier seventeenth centuries. And the key to why that was so is
perhaps to be found in what the historian of the Spanish Inquisition, Henry
Kamen, has described as a peculiarly horrible conjunction in European history,
a conjunction he says between &quot;popular superstition&quot; on the one hand and
&quot;ecclesiastical fantasy&quot; on the other, the fantasies of churchmen.</a>
</p>

<p>The popular superstitious element doesn&#39;t
need any further elaboration of course. It had always been the case that some
individuals were regarded as having this special access to occult power. The
element of ecclesiastical fantasy, however, that was something that was
peculiar to western Christendom. We don&#39;t find it in the Orthodox tradition
and it was peculiar to the early modern period, emerging at the end of the
fifteenth century and growing in strength in the sixteenth. Essentially, it
involved the belief that all witchcraft in fact involved worship of the devil,
and as a result the elaboration of a stereotype of the witch which portrayed
witches not merely as dabblers in magic, or perpetrators of <i>malefice</i>
against neighbors, but as something much more serious, members of an organized
diabolical and malevolent cult: not just village wise women or cunning men but
enemies of God. </p>

<p>Throughout continental Europe, and indeed in
Scotland also, the result of these beliefs was that the main driving force
behind the spasmodic witch hunts which can be found in the period was probably
religious zeal, and the great witch hunts which would be found scattered across
Europe died back only when the judges came to doubt the reality of that
stereotype of the witch and came to doubt the notion that witchcraft was an
organized cult threatening to Christian society. One of the first legal
jurisdictions to make that decision, that the whole thing was just a terrible
error, was in fact the Spanish Inquisition. One doesn&#39;t usually associate the
Spanish Inquisition with progressive movements, but in 1610 they were the first
to abandon, to refuse to deal with, cases of this kind. The French Parlement
again did so in 1640 some years later. So it gradually died away. But
throughout both Catholic and Protestant Europe for some time there was a unity
in the war against witches as enemies of God. Well, how far was that pattern
true of England? </p>

<p>The usual answer is that it wasn&#39;t true of
England and that was for several reasons. First of all, the authorities in
England never actually embraced the full ecclesiastical stereotype of
witchcraft as evidence of membership of a diabolical cult. Continental
European ideas about the nature of witchcraft were certainly known in England. Books
from Europe were read by the educated and these ideas were disseminated by a
number of English writers, usually clergymen, particularly from the 1580s or
thereabouts. Gradually, such notions did seep into popular beliefs and you
begin to find them at the popular level by the mid- to late seventeenth century.
But nevertheless that notion of the nature of witchcraft didn&#39;t have much influence
on English law. </p>

<p>Witchcraft was never prosecuted as a heresy
in England. The first act which was passed against it in 1542 made it a felony--any
crime that was a felony carried the death penalty--made it a felony to practice
witchcraft for unlawful purposes. But that act was only on the statute book for
five years; then it was repealed. After that there was actually no law against
witchcraft for nearly twenty years. Then in 1563 there was a new act. It was
made a felony to invoke evil spirits and to--if they were invoked to cause the
death of another, then execution was the punishment. Otherwise witches were to
be imprisoned or put in the pillory and face death only for a second offense. Then
finally in 1604 came a third act. It elaborated on the 1563 act. It made it a
felony to bewitch anyone to either their death or their injury. For lesser
forms of sorcery people faced imprisonment and death for a second offense. But
some elements of continental European ideas were beginning to creep in at last
in to this third act. For example, it was made a felony to dig up dead bodies
for the purposes of practicing witchcraft. Exactly why they were concerned
with that they don&#39;t explain, but that was one of the clauses of the act. It
was also made a felony to consult with or to feed an evil spirit for any
purpose. </p>

<p>So, some elements of the notion of diabolical
pacts and the like were beginning to creep in but not all of the kind of
stereotype of witchcraft which was well known north of the border in Scotland,
or in continental Europe. Witchcraft remained seen as not specifically
diabolical but rather, as Keith Thomas puts it, an &quot;antisocial crime,&quot; a very
unusual one but an antisocial crime rather than a form of heresy. And that
characteristic, that it&#39;s treated as a specific kind of crime, comes out in the
trial evidence. </p>

<p>For example, in English witchcraft trials
it&#39;s very rare to find any reference to making pacts with the devil. You get
the odd one in the seventeenth century but they are few; so no diabolical pacts
really. No witches&#39; sabbats at which witches met and feasted and danced with
the devil and so forth. Very little sex with devils in English witchcraft
trials, though that was a prominent feature in continental trials. English
witches didn&#39;t fly. [Laughter] They didn&#39;t have much fun at all
really. [Laughter] English witches did, however, have pets. They
had imps and &quot;familiars&quot; as they were known, usually small animals, and they
seem to have been part of popular beliefs in England, that a witch would have a
familiar which could act on her behalf. Ursula Kemp, for example, was alleged
to have had four familiars: two cats, a toad which was called Pygin, and a lamb
which was called Tyffin. </p>

<p>What the English trials focused on first and
foremost was simple maleficent acts. Other elements usually entered only in a
handful of notorious <i>causes celebres</i>. Witches were always condemned for
<i>maleficium</i> and they were hanged rather than burned; it was a crime, not
a heresy. Secondly, particular witchcraft prosecutions were rarely instigated
from above in England. That&#39;s another important difference. There&#39;s no
evidence that the authorities actually wanted a witch hunt. One outstanding
exception to this generalization was the activities in 1645 to &#39;47 of a witch
finder called Matthew Hopkins who operated in East Anglia and to all intents
and purposes hired himself out as a consultant for the discovery of witches. </p>

<p>That was an organized witch hunt from which
Matthew Hopkins personally profited, but it&#39;s the only really outstanding
example of such an outbreak in the history of witchcraft in England. It was
the subject of a wonderful Vincent Price movie thirty [correction: forty] years
or so ago, &quot;Witchfinder General,&quot; which I do recommend. It&#39;s got
nothing to do with the history, but it&#39;s a great movie. Okay. So witchcraft
prosecutions in England tended not to come in these witch hunts that would
bring hundreds of cases. They didn&#39;t come in great waves with the major
exception of Matthew Hopkins&#39; activities. They were sporadic. They were
occasional. They came up one or two at a time and so forth. </p>

<p>In addition, in English law torture was not
used except in state--certain state trials when it was specially authorized by
the privy council. In day-to-day trials torture was not used whereas it was
routinely used in many jurisdictions in continental Europe and indeed in
Scotland. As a result, people were not tortured into confessing. As a result,
large numbers of people were not implicated by people under torture who named
names. What you get in the witchcraft statistics from the English courts is
really a lot of individual prosecutions brought from below by the alleged
victims of witchcraft seeking redress in the courts just like any other crime.
</p>

<p>So there are some important differences in
the way all of this was handled in the law. Nevertheless, England did share in
the general European preoccupation with witchcraft even though to a lesser
extent. Just how far it shared is not fully known. That&#39;s because the
relevant legal records don&#39;t survive for every area of the country. They
survive pretty fully for the whole of the southeast and for the county of
Cheshire but for other parts of the country they tend to survive only from the
seventeenth century point, which is relatively late in the history of this
crime. But where we do have the evidence, one of the striking features is that
the trials appear to have been relatively rare except for the home circuit, the
counties around London. If you look at the handout, if you look at the two
graphs, graph A gives you the trials which took place in different assize
circuits and the line at the top showing the real spike is the home circuit. You
can see how there are vastly more cases being heard in the whole home circuit
than in any other jurisdiction for which we have the records. The second spike
is Matthew Hopkins operating in 1645, but the first spike, as you&#39;ll see, was
in the later years of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>And even within the home circuit, this area,
the cases came predominantly from one part of it, the county of Essex to the
east of London. If you look at the second graph, graph B, there you have the
different counties of the home circuit broken down and it&#39;s clear enough that
Essex is absolutely outstanding in terms of the numbers of cases which came
from that county. To give you some actual figures, in the whole of the reign
of Elizabeth the county of Hertfordshire, which is just to the north of London,
quite a populous county, produced only twenty-four witchcraft cases. The
county of Sussex, a large county to the south of London, produced only fourteen.
The county of Essex produced 172. In fact, between 1560 and 1680, 270
individuals were prosecuted for witchcraft in Essex, whereas in comparison,
taking a county of similar size and similar population, in the period between
1580 and 1709 only thirty-four were prosecuted in the county of Cheshire for
which we have good evidence. So Cheshire, thirty-four: Essex, 270. </p>

<p>In general, most of the trials for which we
have evidence took place in the last quarter of the sixteenth century. In the
home circuit and in Essex in particular, they were at their peak between the
1570s and the early 1590s. Looking at the country as a whole, trials become
very rare everywhere after about 1620. The numbers are falling away after
about 1620 with again the notable exception of the activities of Matthew
Hopkins in the mid- to late 1640s, which caused a new peak of concern within a
downward trend. </p>

<p>Well, that downward trend, the decline of
witchcraft cases, after around 1620 is something which historians have found
relatively easy to explain. The decline can be explained in a number of ways. First
of all, from at least the 1580s some of the justices of the peace and the
assize judges who had to handle these cases were very worried about the
difficulties of proving witchcraft. They weren&#39;t necessarily skeptical. They
frequently believed that witchcraft was possible, but how could you prove in
law that a particular individual was actually responsible unless they
confessed? How could you prove that something was caused by witchcraft rather
than by natural causes, if for example someone died of a lingering illness? And
even if it was witchcraft, who did it? So they were worried about the problem
of proof and they talked about it. In witchcraft cases normal rules of
evidence could not apply and this bothered them. Increasingly in the
seventeenth century, lawyers who were worried about all of this became very
unwilling to entertain cases. They tried to talk people into not prosecuting,
or they were--or they insisted upon additional evidence if a case was to go
forward. </p>

<p>In addition, from the early seventeenth
century onwards there seems to have been an actual decline amongst educated
people in belief in the very possibility of witchcraft. The conviction grew
that it was a fantasy which had been projected onto wretched people by
hysterical neighbors. The conviction grew that the accused did not have the
occult powers that were claimed, even if they thought they did so; they were
frauds. And in the later seventeenth century there was the growth of awareness
of the mechanical philosophy of Sir Isaac Newton, who regarded the universe as
having been created by God and subjected to laws which were immutable; you
could not tamper with God&#39;s natural laws through using spells and the like. </p>

<p>Well, all of this probably had its influence
in the course of the decline of witchcraft prosecutions. Though initially it&#39;s
most likely that it was the legal concern, the unwillingness of some lawyers
and judges to handle these cases, which was the main cause of the falling off
noticeable by the early seventeenth century. So in these various ways one can
perhaps satisfactorily explain the decline of concern with witchcraft, but we
still have to explain the sixteenth-century rise of concern and that turns out
to be much more difficult. Much more difficult because this seems to have been
a genuine popular concern, with cases coming up from below. One can&#39;t simply
explain it in terms of the activities of a number of bishops or judges. </p>

<p>The dominant explanation was put forward some
years ago by Keith Thomas and Alan Macfarlane in two of the pioneering works on
this subject, and they explained the rise of witchcraft prosecutions in terms
of a detailed examination of the circumstances of surviving cases. Witches
were usually women and they were frequently elderly women. Witches were
usually accused of bewitching neighbors within their own village; not
strangers, always neighbors, people they knew. Witches were often poorer than
their alleged victims. This suggested that the accusations were therefore
arising from tensions between relatively marginal women in the village community
and better-off neighbors, who might be men or women. </p>

<p>Then they looked at the known circumstances
of cases, and the classic circumstances were more or less as follows: a quarrel
would occur between neighbors, ending in one of them, the supposed witch, going
away cursing or muttering. The victim would then suffer some form of personal
misfortune. The victim would then begin to entertain suspicion that they&#39;d
been bewitched. They would talk to other neighbors some of whom might have
similar suspicions about the person they suspected. A person would then be
identified as a possible witch, as a malevolent person in the eyes of the
village. It&#39;s possible that some of those who were so accused did practice
magic and did believe themselves to have the power to harm, and to some extent
they may even have used it as a form of begging with menace. The quarrels
between neighbors which initiated cases very often began when someone was
turned away having been begging or asking for a favor of some kind. It&#39;s possible
that some of these marginal women responded to being gradually identified as
witches by playing the part, by scaring their neighbors, as it were, into
meeting their needs. That could go on for years and often did, but eventually
some incident serious enough to trigger off an actual court prosecution would
occur; perhaps a death, something of unusual seriousness. When that happened
someone would bring an accusation; other neighbors would chime in. There were
lots of such accusations. Alan Macfarlane found that in Essex there was an
average of four accusers for each accused witch, so other people would chime in
with their suspicions. Supplementary proofs might be looked for, for example
the witch&#39;s mark--the existence on the witch&#39;s body of a wart or mole or other
mark which seemed to be insensitive to pain and which was thought to be the
place at which the witch&#39;s familiar would feed on her blood. If they found
such a thing it was considered additional proof and the witch might be found
guilty. </p>

<p>Fine. Well, those do indeed seem to have
been what one can think of as the classic circumstances though they were by no
means unusual [correction: universal]. Witchcraft accusations could arise in
other contexts. They could arise for example as a result of personal rivalries
in local politics. An accusation of witchcraft was something which was easy to
throw at another person in order to discredit them, so there are other
circumstances. Not all witches were women, some were men, though most were
women and so on. But these do appear to have been the classic circumstances. </p>

<p>Why then should the late sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries have seen a peak of such accusations because surely one
could find such circumstances earlier and one could find them later? Why was
that the peak period of anxiety? Thomas and Macfarlane suggest, first of all,
it was partly because of the loss of the protective magic which had been
supplied by the medieval church. The Church of England allowed the belief in
witchcraft to continue, but it wouldn&#39;t offer ecclesiastical means of
counter-magic and it forbade people to resort to them. If that was the case,
then bringing a legal accusation, a trial, and eventually seeking an execution
would be the only way out of the impasse. </p>

<p>A second part of their explanation is that
the reason for so many late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century trials was
that because that period was one of unusual tensions within village society,
within neighborhoods. It was a period, as we know, of economic distress, one
which saw a declining position for the poor, especially perhaps the elderly and
marginal poor, the widowed and so forth. The Poor Laws had not yet been fully
put into effect to provide for such people. Neighbors who themselves were
feeling the pinch might be less willing to show charity, less willing to help. They
might feel uncomfortable about that. They might feel rather guilty about that.
That might prey on their minds and make them sensitive to misfortunes which
they saw as the revenge of people to whom they had refused charity, people who
had perhaps cursed them. Accusing such a person of witchcraft was a way of
severing their responsibility, assuaging their feeling of guilt, transferring
it to the accused witch. </p>

<p>Well, all of this is an ingenious
explanation, which may well hold a great deal of truth and it&#39;s indeed widely
accepted as an account of the sociology and psychology of accusations. Recently,
that explanation of Thomas and Macfarlane has been elaborated by more focus
upon the fact that most of those accused of witchcraft were of course women. The
tensions within neighborhoods seemed to have come to focus upon punitive action
against women above all. Why was that? </p>

<p>Thomas and Macfarlane suggest that it was
simply a product of the fact that most of the economically marginal and most of
the aged in particular were indeed poor women. Some feminist writers see it as
more sinister, as constituting an attack upon women who, by their social
situation, or perhaps their aggressive personalities, stood outside the normal
controls of the patriarchal household. It&#39;s an important issue, but one has to
pause, I think, before jumping to the conclusion that witch hunting was in
effect a form of repression of women. Certainly, it was the case that the
association of witchcraft with women specifically, which was universal, derived
in large part from fundamentally misogynistic attitudes. Women were seen as
being morally weaker, as more prone to temptation, as more likely to use occult
means to revenge themselves upon their neighbors; spells were the weapons of
the weak. However, witchcraft prosecutions were not simply a patriarchal drive
against marginal, aggressive, or troublesome women. </p>
<p>The magistrates who heard the cases were men
but the accusers themselves were very often other women. The work of James
Sharpe reveals how many of the suspicions that led to accusations actually
arose in the female spheres of village life; they were often initiated by other
women. Women themselves felt threatened by witchcraft and were deeply involved
in identifying and accusing witches. And on the other hand many of the juries,
universally male, who heard these cases, failed to believe them. Many accused
witches were acquitted by male juries. The gender element then is clearly
there, but it&#39;s complex; it&#39;s paradoxical. These issues remain far from
resolved, but they add further complexity to any discussion of the sociology of
witchcraft accusation. </p>

<p>There were a number of other problems also to
which I need to draw your attention, problems relating not so much to the
sociology of specific witchcraft accusations, but to the history of witchcraft
as a crime, and two questions in particular arise in the English case. First
of all, why were the witchcraft statutes passed in the first place? And,
secondly, once they were passed why did such an utterly disproportionate number
of the cases arise in the county of Essex? Essex seems to be wholly unusual so
far as one can tell. If there were neighborhood tensions which were acute in
the county of Essex leading to such accusations, why were there not such
neighborhood tensions in the counties of Kent or Sussex or Hertfordshire, all
of which were places which had a great deal in common with Essex in terms of
social structure or local economy and so forth. Why Essex? </p>

<p>Well, some brief suggestions. First of all,
as regards the laws, I think it&#39;s worth considering that these laws were passed
when they were, perhaps because of a convergence of two things. First of all,
both of the major witchcraft statutes in England were passed at the beginning
of new regimes, one in Elizabeth&#39;s second Parliament, one in the first
Parliament of King James VI and I. It makes one wonder whether there was an element
in this legislation of symbolism; that acts on this subject were passed perhaps
as part of the propaganda of a new regime, that passing statutes of this nature
in a sense conferred legitimacy on new regimes by showing their firm stance
against a particularly symbolically charged form of deviance. To be opposed to
witchcraft was in a sense a declaration of legitimacy. The acts may have had
then a certain symbolic function when they were passed through Parliament,
without opposition so far as we can tell. </p>

<p>Secondly, another element of the timing of
the acts is the fact that there may have been an element of political
contingency, specifically in the form of suspected threats to the person of the
monarch. In 1561, two years before the 1563 act was brought forward, a plot
had been discovered in which sorcery was allegedly being used against
Elizabeth. William Cecil was horrified to find, when the plot was uncovered,
that there was actually nothing on the statute book forbidding it. This may
have been a contingent political reason for moving ahead with a witchcraft
statute. It may have persuaded him to go along with one or two of the bishops
who were themselves interested in having legislation on this issue. That&#39;s an
interpretation, then, which might be particularly relevant to the passage of
the 1563 act though the full details of its passage through Parliament remain
unknown; the documentation is too poor. </p>

<p>The act of 1604 is a lot clearer. Following
the accession of James VI of Scotland as James I of England, he was a man with
a profound interest in witchcraft, he&#39;d written a book about it on the subject
in--he&#39;d written a book about the subject in Scotland--following his accession
and the union of crowns, the witchcraft statutes of both England and Scotland
were overhauled and revised by a committee of judges and bishops. This again
may have been a symbolic act. They decided to do it then. Why then? It&#39;s a
new regime and a new act was passed in Scotland at the same time. It may have
been helped along again by the fact that in 1604 there was a particularly
notorious witchcraft case in London itself, which may have drawn attention to
the problem once again. </p>

<p>So what I&#39;m suggesting is that these acts of
Parliament were essentially introduced as legitimizing symbols: good and godly
laws introduced by good and godly regimes. Yet there&#39;s no evidence that the
authorities that put them on the statute book actually wanted a witch hunt. If
they&#39;d wanted one, they could have had one. But they didn&#39;t. What they did was
to make witchcraft prosecutions possible in the royal courts--and to that
extent the political and ecclesiastical elite had a bigger role in making
possible the prosecutions which took place than is often recognized. </p>

<p>So one can perhaps explain why the acts were
put on the statute book in that kind of way, but that still leaves the problem
of Essex. Why Essex? Is it possible that Essex as a local society was
peculiarly conscious of the threat of witchcraft? But why should that be so? It&#39;s
quite clear that people might feel threatened by <i>maleficium</i> in any part
of England. Why should they act against it so much more in the county of
Essex? And the only suggestion I can make on that issue is that the use of the
criminal law against witches had had terrible publicity in Essex. Essex was
unusual in the sense that it saw three <i>causes celebres</i>, three group
trials. They took place in 1566, only three years after the passage of
Elizabeth&#39;s statute; in 1582; and in 1589. In each of these cases an initial
accusation was vigorously pursued by local justices of the peace who happened
to have a particular personal concern about witchcraft. That meant that
instead of just one person going on trial small groups of women went on trial
and these trials were well publicized in pamphlets which were written about
them and which survive to this day. You can read them on Early English Books Online.
</p>

<p>All of this, then, may have given peculiar
publicity to witchcraft as a threat and what could be done about it. One
wonders, then, whether a number of particularly scandalous local cases
occurring in this county had the effect of heightening anxiety about witchcraft
within Essex, enhancing the sense of threat which people felt, making it more
intense than elsewhere, and of course providing an object lesson in how to deal
with it. So are we dealing then with a moral panic breaking out within a
particular local society, which subsequently died down in the seventeenth
century until it was artificially revived again by the activities of Matthew
Hopkins, the Witchfinder General, in 1645? Ursula Kemp incidentally was one of
the women tried in one of those group trials, the one of 1582. </p>

<p>So to conclude: the whole issue of the
history of witchcraft, why people were so concerned with it at a particular
point in time, is clearly enormously complex. But what I&#39;m suggesting is that
first, the case of England was different to a degree from what was going on
elsewhere in Europe at the time. There were no mass witch hunts to marry
popular superstition and ecclesiastical fantasy in the way one found in various
parts of Europe and in Scotland, Matthew Hopkins excepted. Secondly, in
England witchcraft prosecutions did come up spontaneously from below and they
probably usually arose in pretty much the way Thomas and Macfarlane and James
Sharpe have suggested, as far as individual cases were concerned, though it was
an accusation which could also be used for malicious prosecution and was so
used. </p>

<p>But thirdly, these cases could only arise
because of the existence of laws which were perhaps essentially symbolic and
contingent in their origins. And that once those laws existed, fourthly, the
cases arose only sporadically. The sense we have of a definite chronological
pattern in witchcraft prosecutions is very heavily influenced as you&#39;ve seen by
the case of Essex alone. Essex does seem to have been unique for very special
reasons which we may never be able to do more than to guess at. Elsewhere in
the country cases arose sporadically, occasionally, no clear pattern beyond the
fact that they were more common in the late sixteenth century than later.</p>

<p>And finally, there was no English witch hunt
because at the end of the day the authorities in both church and state didn&#39;t
want one. They never felt sufficiently threatened to instigate one against
those they deemed their enemies. The potential for a witch hunt was there and
it long continued. Village tensions hadn&#39;t faded. The difference of the
seventeenth century from the later sixteenth century was above all that the
judicial authorities not only failed to seek a witch hunt, but actually became
active in suppressing the accusations which were brought before them. So then,
I suspect that overall both the rise and the fall of witchcraft prosecution is
best explained by the way in which the law first of all gave people, and then
later took away from them, the opportunity to settle a particular kind of
personal conflict through the use of the law and the prosecution of people to
their deaths. </p>

<p>The beliefs behind all of that were very
ancient and they long continued, but the history of witchcraft is very much to
do with the use of the criminal law in the way I&#39;ve described. The crucial
issue was perhaps that for a short while, for two generations, there was indeed
a conjunction of long-standing patterns of popular belief with a shorter-term
enhancement of the anxieties and the credulousness of the elite. It was they
who passed the laws that made witchcraft trials possible. They later repented
of their folly. They avoided the enforcement of those laws and eventually, in
1736, they repealed them. But that, of course, was about 150 years too late for
Ursula Kemp. </p>
