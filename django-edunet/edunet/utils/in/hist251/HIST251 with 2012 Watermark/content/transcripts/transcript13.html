<p><b>Professor Keith Wrightson: </b>Okay. Well last time I was presenting
a kind of panorama of economic expansion; on the whole, a very upbeat story. It
helps to explain how the long population growth of the late sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries was able to be sustained. And yet, as the final table on
last-time&#39;s handout showed, there&#39;s also reason to doubt whether the expansion
was sufficient, or whether the new wealth that was being created was well
enough distributed in society, to avoid some real problems. Especially, real
wages continued to fall and there were complaints of a growing problem of
poverty and vagrancy. So there are paradoxes in the situation. And to get the
economic expansion into perspective, we have to look a little more closely at
how it actually impacted on people from different social groups. Inevitably
that involves a certain amount of generalization but I&#39;ll also try to give you
examples of people from different groups which will help to give it something
of a human face. So, let&#39;s start by looking, as usual, at the top and at what
was happening to the landlords, the gentry, the nobility. </p>
<p>It&#39;s really one of the striking
features of English society in this period that many of the nobility and gentry
identified themselves very closely with economic innovations. Their imperative
was to maintain and, if possible, expand their estate incomes and in doing so
they became very deeply involved in the commercial restructuring of the
country&#39;s economy. </p>
<p>That&#39;s rather unusual for a
traditional ruling class. On the whole, such people tend to rely more upon
their social privileges than upon trying to improve their competitiveness. But,
certainly, the gentry and the aristocracy, or many of them, did make real
efforts of that kind. And you get, basically, an acceleration of the trends
which had already become visible in the mid-sixteenth century: a lot more
careful management of their estates in order to produce more from their home
farms for the market and in order to get a greater rental income. That often
involved extending the use of leasehold tenure, tenure of land just like a
modern lease; and wiping away the old, rather inflexible, customary tenures so
that they had a more flexible management of their rental income. There was
also something I touched on last time: a good deal of reorganizing their
estates into enclosed farms, for which they could get better rents. And in
general, every effort being made to edge rents upwards when opportunity arose. And
in general, the landlord class did pretty well. </p>
<p>Of course a lot depended upon the
fortunes of particular individuals and their personal quirks and
characteristics. To take, for example, the Verney family, who had substantial
estates in Buckinghamshire, just to the north-west of London: Sir Edmund
Verney, who lived in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, was a
man who was principally interested in forging a political career at court. That
was very expensive. He had to sink a lot of his income into fortifying his
position at the centre and as a result he incurred pretty considerable debts. He
succeeded quite well; he became King Charles I&#39;s Standard Bearer. In fact, he
died in one of the earliest battles of the English Civil War bearing the King&#39;s
Standard. But his son, Sir Ralph, was of a rather different nature; he
actually took a different side in the English Civil War. And when the War was
over he devoted himself assiduously to restoring and improving the rather depleted
inheritance he&#39;d received from his father; involved in all the kinds of
measures of estate management that I&#39;ve briefly mentioned. Indeed, Sir Ralph
was so keen to rebuild the family&#39;s fortunes that when his first wife died he
remained celibate; he didn&#39;t remarry. He didn&#39;t want any more children. He
didn&#39;t want the risk of the estate having to be divided amongst more children,
since he already had a number who had survived infancy. </p>
<p>So, different personalities, different
outcomes; but all part of the same process. In general, the income of the
gentry and the nobility was expanding. And much of it was spent, not only upon
extending and improving their estates, but upon various kinds of conspicuous
consumption. It&#39;s a great age for the rebuilding of the manor house&#39;s of the
gentry. Many of the lovely country houses which still survive were built in
this period, or rebuilt, as well as some of the great &#39;prodigy houses&#39; of the
age. The great mansions: Burghley House near Stamford which is up here in East
Anglia; or Kirkby Hall in Northamptonshire, it&#39;s another very good example,
that&#39;s over here, the splendid mansion from this period which survives. </p>
<p>They went in for more elaborate
furnishing and lifestyles and, in addition, this was a period when many of the
gentry and nobility, the wealthier ones, began to spend part of the year in
London. It sees the beginnings of the development of what became known as the
&#39;London Season&#39;: the habit of spending the winter in town and being absent from
their estates, which were run by stewards for long periods of the year. This
resulted in something of an urbanization of gentry culture, something which has
been, recently, very well studied by Julia Merritt in a book on the emerging
West End of London; the elite aristocratic enclaves around the royal palaces. To
give you an idea of the kind of proportion of these people who might be in
town, in 1632 King Charles I, in the circumstances of a harvest emergency,
ordered the gentry to return to their estates to keep order and to see to the
needs of local people. He had to fine 250 members of the nobility and gentry
who were resident in London and didn&#39;t go home when they were ordered to do so.
Given that the great gentry and nobility numbered, perhaps, 2,000 families, that&#39;s
a very significant proportion of them who were resident in London and were
fined for failing to go home. </p>
<p>Well, if this was a good time on the
whole, for landlords, if they used the opportunity sensibly, if we turn to
their tenantry, to the yeomen and husbandman, one finds a more checkered
picture. Opportunities to improve incomes were also common amongst the more
substantial farmers. Those who had a big farm with a substantial surplus to
market, were actually very well placed to benefit from rising prices and for
the growth of the market for their products, be it food-stuff or agricultural
raw materials. Many of these yeomen were extremely commercially astute. A
very good example is a man called Robert Loder, here&#39;s his name, whose farm
accounts survive from the 1610s. He lived just to the west of London in the
county of Berkshire. Robert Loder calculated every year exactly how much money
he was making from different crops. He took decisions about how to vary his
cropping pattern in accordance with price trends, especially the prices which
he could get in London, and so forth. He even went so far, at one point, as to
actually calculate the value of the dung that his pigeons deposited in his
pigeon loft. He figured it out, what it was worth to him if he used it as
fertilizer in his gardens. This is commercial rationality of a high order. He
also calculated how much money his horses made for him over and above what he
had to feed them. He then proceeded to do the same calculation for his servants.
</p>
<p>Well, Robert Loder had nothing to
learn about economic rationality and his basic attitudes are not untypical of
this kind of substantial yeomen farmer. Many such people were willing to
expand their operations if they got the opportunity; if land came available on
the local land market they would snap it up. They were able to pay higher
rents. They were in an excellent competitive position and as a result, you get
a general shift in lowland England towards the building up of larger farms. In
the county of Essex, for example, here to the east of London, it was very
commercially oriented. By the early seventeenth century, nine percent,
approximately, of the tenants held sixty-one percent of the land, built up in
these large yeomen holdings. And there&#39;s abundant evidence of the prosperity
of the yeomanry. It was a great age for them. </p>
<p>This period has been described by
historians of housing as the age of the &#39;Great Rebuilding&#39;. And by that they
mean not only the houses of the gentry, which I&#39;ve already mentioned, but the
houses of the yeomanry. It was a period when many of the farm houses inherited
from the late medieval period were being remodeled. It was very common, for
example, they tended in the late medieval period to be what was known as a &#39;hall
house&#39;, which was basically one large room with some partitions and a
fireplace, the smoke from which would just be emitted through a whole in the
roof. This is a period when you see people building great, central chimney
stacks, so that they could have fireplaces and get rid of the smoke, making the
whole of the interior more comfortable. They tended to divide off the top of
the house and to make separate, private chambers above, and frequently they
would add staircases, of course, to get up there. They might extend their
homes in all kinds of ways. Many of these houses, the great yeomen houses of
this period, survive to this day. </p>
<p>When you look at the inventories of
these people, which were taken when they died, they also reveal a marked
increase in the value of their household goods and in the elaboration of the
types of goods that people possessed. William Harrison, a clergyman who
described all of this happening in the later years of Elizabeth&#39;s reign, said
that despite the fact that higher rents were being paid, many of the villagers
in his area--the yeomen farmers are the ones he was thinking of--were able, he
said &quot;yet to find the means to obtain and achieve such furniture as
heretofore hath been unpossible.&quot; And he went on to specify what that
involved: joined furniture made by joiners, proper joined chairs rather than
stools; nice tables; bedsteads; soft furnishings. There&#39;s a proliferation in
inventories of cushions and of carpet cloths. Carpets were--these were
oriental carpets being imported by the Levant Company. They were put on
tables, you didn&#39;t put a carpet on the floor; it was far too valuable for that.
You put it on the table, to decorate the table. Some representations of
interior scenes in this period show that: the carpet across the table. And you
find them also having more elaborate table-wear and more elaborate
kitchen-wear, all sorts of odd products turning up in their inventories: apple
toasters, for example. An apple toaster, something Crate and Barrel should
perhaps try to imitate, to hold in the fire with an apple in it, and so on; all
kinds of things. It&#39;s been described by one historian of material culture as
&quot;a new household culture&quot; with much greater comfort, much greater
convenience, being enjoyed by these people.<sup>1</sup>
They could also put their money into other things: bigger dowries for their
daughters so they could marry well. A study of Kent shows that in the reign of
Elizabeth, the dowries being paid by yeomen with their daughters rose six-fold
in the course of her reign. And they could also spend the money to have their
sons apprenticed into trade, into professions, sent to school, in some cases
even to the universities, something that I&#39;ll return to on another occasion. </p>
<p>Well, the yeomanry were the big fish of
village society. Things were a little more difficult for the little minnows--the
smaller guys, the family-farming husbandman. Some of them did fine. If they
lived near a city they might have good marketing opportunities, they could
specialize in producing fruit or market-gardening or dairying and could do
pretty well. You also get a lot of husbandman diversifying their activities
into part-time industrial activity. Over in the West Midlands, in the metal
working districts, the inventories of scythe makers, for example, can be quite
interesting, indicating that these people were engaged in farming, but also in
producing scythe blades on the side; they had forges. Generally, they would
work at that in the slack periods of the agricultural year. </p>
<p>But for many of these small guys, the
period was fraught with risk. The crucial issue was whether they could sustain
their small farming economy under changing conditions. These were the people
who would have most difficulty meeting higher rents. They might have a poor
competitive position. One agricultural writer described them as &quot;weak and
un-stocked husbandmen.&quot; They lacked capital; they produced smaller crops;
they made smaller profits; they had fewer livestock. They couldn&#39;t really,
seriously contemplate indulging in expensive or risky innovations. And they
were also very vulnerable to temporary crises like those produced by bad
harvests, which could wipe out their surplus and force them into debt. Some of
these people became vulnerable and were driven to the wall and their land was
taken up by more ambitious neighbors. And, in general, there&#39;s a diminution in
the numbers of these small farmers. As the big farms are growing, many of the
small ones are disappearing. A whittling away of small tenancies, which, in
turn, made it rather difficult for the young to get onto the land to establish
a foothold. More of the young people from rural families, after their period
as servants in the households of larger farmers, were more likely to spend
their lives as agricultural wage laborers than getting land of their own. </p>
<p>So, the fortunes of different groups
in rural society varied. They&#39;re broadly fairly clear. One can generalize
with some confidence. In the towns the picture&#39;s a little less clear. Clearly
there was a lot of commercial development and business opportunity, but this
was a period when business was fraught with risk. Finding the capital to set
up could be difficult. Keeping businesses going could be difficult in a period
when cash flow could be hard to manage. People had to keep a good balance
between their debts and credits; that could be very difficult. Accumulation of
wealth was often very slow. And even the successful could be wiped out by
temporary economic crises; by fraud; by fire--there&#39;s no fire insurance; by
shipwreck--there&#39;s no marine insurance; and so forth. </p>
<p>It was to try to counter some of these
insecurities that some of the principal merchants of England&#39;s cities
preferred, if possible, to be members of chartered trading companies. Those
companies which had a monopoly of particular branches of trade, the ones I
mentioned last time, and which laid down rules for the conduct of the trade;
rules which were generally aimed at securing stable profits for all the members
of the company. And to restrict the numbers of people who were involved in
particular trades. It&#39;s true that no trading monopoly could protect a merchant
from shipwreck, or piracy, or the collapse of demand, but, nonetheless, one can
generalize to some degree, about the way in which they fared. </p>
<p>For some, who were members of
established companies, things could go pretty well. Take, for example, the
Levant Company. The Levant Company traded to the Mediterranean, especially the
eastern Mediterranean. In 1570 it was founded. By the early seventeenth
century to become a member of the Levant Company meant laying down two to three
hundred pounds as membership fee; quite a substantial sum of money. By the
early seventeenth century also, this company has been described as, I&#39;m
quoting, &quot;a highly ramified network of interconnecting family
relationships,&quot; the members of which were often related to one another and
controlling a great share of the trade. One contemporary described them as
&quot;born rich and adding wealth to wealth by trading in a beaten road to
wealth.&quot; In 1627 there were only twenty-four men who controlled
fifty-four percent of the Levant trade. So, members of the great companies,
having established the trade, could restrict it in various ways in order to ensure
some stability in their trading lives. It was members of that company who were
later to go on to found the East India Company. </p>
<p>Well, in addition, though, there were
certain additional opportunities. Another way to prosper, if you had the nerve
and would take the risks, was to get involved in pioneering altogether new
trades. And the most significant of those were the American trades. With the
early establishment of colonies in America, the initial opportunities were not
obviously good and many members of established trading companies were reluctant
to invest. That left the path open for those who were prepared to take the
risks of involvement and very often, those who got involved in the American
trades were men of lesser standing in the merchant community: smaller
merchants, even shopkeepers, ships captains, people like that who were willing
to get involved; new men, you could say. </p>
<p>They built up, as you know, a very
substantial trade in the course of the early seventeenth century. To just give
you an example of one of these people, a man called Maurice Thompson. Maurice
Thompson was the younger son of a gentry family. He got a little bit of
capital from his family but not much more; he didn&#39;t inherit the family estate.
He came from Hertfordshire, just to the north of London. How he came to go to
Virginia is uncertain, but he was there by the time he was in his mid-teens and
he got involved on the ground floor with the development of the tobacco trade. Pretty
soon he owned land, he owned a ship, he became involved in the trade in tobacco
and in the supply of goods needed by the colonists. He expanded his operations;
he married well; he became a significant figure amongst the leaders of the
Virginia colony as quite a young man. By the time he was in his early thirties
he was back in London, managing much of the--a good part of the Virginia trade
from his base there. And, indeed, he went on to expand his operations to
become involved in the Indian Ocean and in other ventures. If you&#39;re interested
in that kind of person and that kind of development, Robert Brenner&#39;s book, <i>Merchants
and Revolution</i>, the first section is a splendid depiction of these shifts
and developments in the last years of Elizabeth and under the early Stuarts. </p>
<p>At lower levels in the urban
hierarchy, the capital that people needed to set up in business was gradually
growing. That made it a little more difficult to establish yourself as an
independent master and a great many people had to be content with serving as
skilled craftsmen working for others, whereas previously they might have hoped
to become independent masters. Even skilled employees were often forced to
work longer and more intensively, if the work was available, in order to
sustain their living standards. To give you a specific example of this, I&#39;ve
got some figures here relating to building craftsmen from the town of Hull, on
the east coast. Donald Woodward, in a very imaginative piece of research,
worked out the price of foodstuffs; found the wages being paid to craftsmen of
different kinds; and then figured out how many days you would need to work to
feed husband, wife and three children. So, here are some of his figures. The
best paid men in the 1560s could have fed their families with a hundred and
fifty-three days work. By the 1630s, with rising prices, and wages not rising
so fast, two hundred and twenty-nine days. The worst paid, a hundred and
ninety-two days in the 1560s, three hundred and six by the 1630s. So, this was
the experience of some of the craftsmen of the towns. </p>
<p>In short then, urban manufactures and
the urban manufacturing system was becoming less small master-based and rather
more capitalistically structured, with a larger proportion of urban craftsmen
having to cope with the difficulties and uncertainties of their dependence upon
wage labor. Well, much of the same was true of the industries of the
countryside. In Somersetshire, in the West Country, where the cloth industry
was the major industry in the 1620s, one contemporary described the &quot;multitudes
of poor cottages&quot; which were to be found in the cloth-weaving areas. And he
continued they are &quot;stuffed with poor people which get most of their living by
spinning, by carding, and such employments about wool and cloth.&quot; And they
gained their living most of the time, but he added that when trade was dead &quot;they
know not how to live,&quot;</p>
<p>In town and country alike, then, what
contemporaries described as the &quot;laboring poor&quot; was emerging as a
larger, more wage-dependent population emerged; probably half the population by
the mid-seventeenth century, to judge by surviving tax listings. Agricultural
intensification and a diversification of industry and urban growth all meant
that there was more work for such people. But the work was often seasonal; it
was often insecure; there was a lot of under-employment, difficulty finding
five days work a week; and so forth. And there was the constant pressure of
greater numbers of people on the labor market. And it was this, really, that
issued in what&#39;s sometimes described as a problem of &#39;structural poverty&#39;. A
large number of people whose very way of life on a day to day basis meant
periodic hardship was almost inevitable some of the time; people who faced a
situation in which the rate of pay for their labor was such as to mean declining
capacity to meet the needs of their households. </p>
<p>And that produced a distinct life cycle
amongst the laboring poor. They could manage pretty well until they had, say,
two children or so. They might even have a little bit of disposable income to
spend on manufactured goods, but once they had too many mouths to feed, or if
the chief breadwinners fell sick or injured, or if there was a trading
depression, they could be plunged immediately into real hardship. And in old
age, if they reached old age, they almost inevitably would be dependent upon
charity. Many of these people survived by what&#39;s been described as &quot;an
economy of makeshifts,&quot; it&#39;s a phrase of Olwen Hufton&#39;s, &quot;an economy of
makeshifts.&quot; You get by as best you can, doing what you can. Cottaging
where they could; using the commons if they were available; gleaning the fields
after the harvest, the poor were allowed to glean for grains of corn in the
fields after harvest; and finding various kinds of assistance from their
family, from their neighbors; moving around when there seemed to be better
opportunities to piece together a living. </p>
<p>And for that reason, they tended to
become concentrated in certain areas where those opportunities existed. It was
a rather unsettled life for many of them. I&#39;ll give you a couple of examples of
these people: Margaret Knowsley she came from Nantwich in Cheshire, there&#39;s her
name. She&#39;s visible in the records between 1613 and 1629. She was married to
a laborer. We know that she had ten children between 1613 and 1629. Five of
her children died in infancy. Something of her working life survives in
various records. She worked as an ale wife, making and selling ale; she worked
as an agricultural laborer during the appropriate seasons; she did some
stocking knitting; she acted as a cleaner for the minister of the parish; she&#39;s
thought to have practiced some forms of medical skills, she had some skills in
aspects of midwifery, apparently. She was alleged also, from time to time, to
have solicited men for money. So, that&#39;s &quot;an economy of makeshifts&quot;
indeed. Or, another such person, Henry Savery, he&#39;s visible in the records
between 1629 and 1636. He came from Stow Bardolph in the county of Suffolk. We
know a little bit about Henry. In 1629 he was a servant. He left service and
instead of engaging himself to a new master, decided to go to London. Once he
got to London he found it difficult to find regular work so he signed-on for a
voyage on a ship, but he wasn&#39;t a very good sailor. By the time the ship had
got out into the Thames estuary he was suffering from chronic seasickness and
his legs were swelling up. So, finding him no use to him, the shipmaster put
him to shore and just landed him and discharged him. He went back to London. There,
he was taken by the constables as a vagrant and sent home to Stow Bardolph. In
1635 he decided to try at his fortunes again. He left Stow Bardolph after
haymaking where he&#39;d earned a total of seven shillings; he had seven shillings
in his purse. He went to the county of Suffolk--further into the County of
Suffolk--and worked in various farms there for three months and then he went
off to London again. Once again, he found it difficult to find regular work so
he began working &quot;up and down the country,&quot; as he described it. He got as far
north as York and then made his way back again. Back in London, he found
himself once again arrested as a vagrant and sent home to Norfolk. And there
we lose track of Henry Savery; he vanishes from the records.<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>That&#39;s exactly the kind of person,
moving around, trying to earn a living where he could, who might have been the
sort of person who would&#39;ve signed-on with a shipmaster in London to become an
indentured servant in the new colonies in Virginia and Maryland. And indeed,
many people who found their way to London but couldn&#39;t find a place there did
just that. In London, there was an institution charged with the oversight of
the vagrant poor, the Bridewell. And the governors of the Bridewell actually
dispatched over 1,100 people to Virginia and the West Indies between 1618 and
1658. At first they were mostly men, about ninety percent men, but by the 1630s
about a third of them, or close to a third, were women. Two thirds of these
people who were sent had been taken by the officers on the streets of London. Some
of them were accused of crime, they might have been accused of being
pickpockets or thieves; but most of them were simply out on the streets. They
were described as &quot;out after curfew&quot; or &quot;nightwalkers&quot;--that
was just loitering suspiciously on the streets at night. Some of them were
former servants who had no place and were on the streets, and they were sent by
the Bridewell to the new colonies. </p>
<p>One of those who was sent gave his
occupation as &quot;Ballad Singer&quot; which makes me wonder if that&#39;s the
origins of country music [laughter]. I&#39;m serious
[laughs]. In the early twentieth century, songs collected by
folklorists in the Appalachians, many of those songs can actually be traced
back to printed ballads which are known to be sung on the streets of London in
the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. They passed into the oral
culture of the Appalachian area. </p>
<p>Well, one can go on about these
people. There&#39;s a wonderful recent book by Paul Griffiths called <i>Lost
Londons </i>which looks closely at them through the records of the Bridewell. The
Bridewell kept excellent records; they even kept physical descriptions of some
of the people they dealt with so they could identify them if they turned up again.
And so, we have descriptions of, you know, their stature: &quot;slender;&quot; &quot;well-set;&quot;
&quot;thick-set;&quot; one was described as &quot;great-gutted.&quot; Their complexion: &quot;sallow;&quot; &quot;high-colored;&quot;
&quot;bright;&quot; &quot;sad,&quot; a sad complexion was described. Their hair color: &quot;flaxen;&quot; &quot;dark
brown;&quot; &quot;betwixt auburn and flaxen.&quot; All of these descriptions are entered in
the books. Their clothing: a woman found on the streets wearing a red
petticoat and a white upper-bodice; so, poor but colorfully dressed. Some, of
course, were beggars who were near-naked. You get descriptions also of their
medical condition: &quot;pock-marked in his face&quot;; &quot;a small scar upon his forehead;&quot;
&quot;burned in the hand,&quot; that means someone had been found guilty of a crime and
branded for future identification. And sometimes they were suffering from
disease: &quot;palsied;&quot; &quot;scurvy;&quot; &quot;scalded-headed,&quot; that was very common. It meant
a kind of scalp condition. One man, well, a boy actually, described as &quot;his
toes almost rotted off.&quot; Others were mentally ill: &quot;crack-brained;&quot; &quot;silly;&quot;
&quot;simple.&quot; That&#39;s how they&#39;re described. One description that arrested me when
reading this was: &quot;a Northern man by his speech,&quot; &quot;high-colored,&quot; &quot;beard
close-cut mingled with white hair,&quot; &quot;in a manner crazed.&quot; </p>
<p>And then you get those people on the
streets of London who had no known identity, they turn up in the parish
records. The parish of Saint Bartholomew&#39;s, for example, gave assistance to a
beggar who turned up at the church who had no name. They put him down in their
account books as money given to &quot;Bartholomew Need.&quot; &quot;Bartholomew
Need&quot; because he came to Saint Bartholomew&#39;s church. And you find the
children who were left on the streets. Often when they were taken in by parish
authorities, they would give them a name: &quot;Michael Found;&quot; &quot;Joan Foundbasket&quot; (a
baby found in a basket);&quot; &quot;Porch Wall,&quot; she was found in porch of the church of
Saint Andrew by the Wall, so they baptized her &quot;Porch Wall&quot;; and so one could
go on, &quot;Joan Mad.&quot; Or those who were sometimes buried in the parishes, found
dead on the streets: &quot;John No Name&quot;; &quot;Jane Nobody.&quot; </p>
<p>So, England&#39;s increasing income was
very unevenly distributed. It was an expanding economy but one with an
expanding problem of structural poverty. It was a commercializing society in
which there were great opportunities, but many of those who had nothing to sell
but their labor were in a poor competitive position and in an exceedingly risky
environment. Of course, some aspects of those insecurities were perennial, but
at times they could become particularly acute. And the times that stand out
are the 1590s, which was a time when the harvest failed four years in a row,
food prices rocketed, the weaknesses in the economy were revealed, and there
was widespread misery. Indeed, in the years 1596 to 1598 there was actual
famine in the most vulnerable areas; parts of the far north, north-west in
particular, and parts of the far west. There&#39;s evidence of actual death from
starvation. The 1620s was another decade when there were bad harvests, combined,
in this case, with an industrial depression. War in Europe had dislocated the
markets for some of the goods that England exported, leading to industrial
depression. There was widespread unemployment and poverty in many of the
weaving areas. And again, some sinister evidence of actual famine in some of
the most exposed areas. These were the hardest years. Really acute crises of
that kind, of course, were exceptional, but they revealed the weaknesses within
society as a whole. </p>
<p>So, how to conceptualize all of this? Very
often historians talk about these decades, these generations at the turn of the
sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, as witnessing a process of &quot;social
polarization&quot; and there&#39;s some obvious truth in that. There&#39;s a real divergence
going on in living standards and in life chances in a more competitive,
commercialized economy. But it&#39;s also, in some ways, more complex than simply
the notion of polarization. In many ways, the social structure was
rearticulating into a, sort of, three-part form. There were greater
opportunities, on the one hand, to acquire and to consolidate wealth. There
was a greater population of laboring poor on the other hand, both of which
we&#39;ve looked at. But there was also the elaboration of what contemporaries
were beginning to describe as the &quot;middle sort of people,&quot; between the gentry
and the poor. Successful manufacturers and tradesman, substantial yeomen
farmers, increasing numbers of people involved in professions like the law and
medicine and the offering of services of other kinds: surveyors, clerks, land
agents and so forth. </p>
<p>So, it all depends on how one looks at
it. You can focus your attention upon the real polarization; you can also take
account of these middling groups who are doing quite well. But, whichever way
one looks at it, it&#39;s clear that the old medieval conception of a society,
simply describable in terms of three estates, had gradually decomposed under
the pressure of economic and social change, and society was gradually recomposing
itself; adopting a new shape under the pressure of various economic fields of
force. And that transition involved not only shifts in the structure of
society, but also shifts in peoples&#39; attitudes and values. </p>
<p>By the early seventeenth century,
decades of cumulative economic and social change meant that economic
relationships and forms of behavior which had previously appeared new and
rather threatening were becoming more normalized, more taken for granted. And
some traditional values were losing some of their older moral force and you can
see that in various ways, but a good example is to look very briefly at the
problem of enclosure, the classic issue of great symbolic significance in
agrarian society. As you know, in the mid-sixteenth century, enclosure had
been demonized as something which was damaging to the well-being of the
ploughman, to the strength of the nation, destructive of households and of the
Commonwealth. And throughout the later sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries, actual enclosure schemes were very often opposed by coalitions of
tenants and commoners who tried to defend their customary ways against the
initiatives of landlords and others, and we look at that again when I look at
popular protest. </p>
<p>But, meanwhile, the debate over
enclosure was gradually shifting. You get that shift reflected in Parliament. In
1601 there was a debate on the enclosure laws and whether or not to repeal
them. Sir Robert Cecil, son of William Cecil, Elizabeth&#39;s chief minister,
speaking on behalf of the privy council said, &quot;I think that whosoever doth
not maintain the plough, destroyeth this kingdom.;&quot; very much the traditional
attitude towards enclosure. He was opposed by Sir Walter Raleigh, yes, <i>the</i>
Sir Walter Raleigh, who said he agreed that there was a situation which must be
faced regarding agricultural change, but he argued that there were lots of
countries in Europe which could produce corn cheaper than England could and,
therefore, it should be imported rather than insisting upon maintaining land
under the plough. He argued that every man should use his land to its best
advantage and should be at liberty to do so. &quot;Leave every man free,&quot;
he said, to pursue his economic interest. So we have the voice of economic
individualism opposing Cecil. </p>
<p>Debates like that in Parliament reveal
a gradual process of transition in attitudes, tensions and shifts between older
and newer attitudes, and that tension was resolved in various ways: sometimes
by authoritative adjudication, by government decisions in Parliament or the privy
council; often by sheer expediency, by people gradually adjusting themselves,
voluntarily or reluctantly, to the demands of a changing world. In the case of
enclosure, gradually most of the gentry and many leading tenant farmers came to
accept its desirability, and the laws against it were in fact repealed in 1624,
leaving people free to use their land as they saw best, as Raleigh had argued. </p>
<p>Well, the attempts to stabilize and
channel change by the use of the law gave way gradually to attempts simply to
alleviate the worst manifestations of change where it had led to major social
distress, and the greatest monument to efforts of that kind were the Poor Laws.
The crisis years of the 1590s led to the overhaul and consolidation and extension
by Parliament of earlier measures which had been taken in poor relief,
resulting in great consolidated statutes of 1598 and 1601. Under those
statues, a full national system of poor relief was created, based upon
compulsory local taxation at the level of the parish, administered by officers
to be appointed in every parish. Under the laws, vagrants were to be punished
and restrained; those who were deemed the &quot;impotent poor&quot;--the aged, the sick,
the orphaned--were to be relieved by being paid weekly pensions in their
parishes; and finally, the &quot;laboring poor&quot;--those who could get by most of the
time but needed occasional relief--were to be periodically relieved by the
parish to enable their families to get through hard times and, where possible,
work was to be created for them. </p>
<p>So what you have in the Poor Laws is a
mixture of charity and discipline. In some ways, the system was quite well
devised to deal with the periodic life-cycle crises of the laboring population,
though rarely generously. It was a system which in many ways demonstrated
England&#39;s relative wealth. There was a tax base there to pay for it. But it
was one, of course, which also demonstrated how unequally distributed that
wealth was. In one parish, for example, the parish of Cawston in Norfolk,
where the laws were put into operation very early, there were sixty-eight
people in the parish out of one hundred and sixty households who were able to
pay the poor rates to support the system. At the other end of the scale there
were twenty households who received weekly pensions. So, sixty-eight are
paying, twenty are receiving pensions, all the ones in between are neither
paying nor in receipt of relief, though in bad times some of those families
might receive occasional help. So, the Poor Laws, in a way, are both a
response to and enshrine some of the changes which had taken place in society
at the local level. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve surveyed, then, a process of
redistribution of wealth in a changing economic environment. Economic
development had enabled the population of England to grow faster, for longer
than was usually the case in other European countries at this time. But the
benefits of economic growth were poorly distributed and that showed. </p>
<p>Population, at last, began to
stabilize in the third decade of the seventeenth century and that began to slow
down this long-term process of change. The reasons for that stabilization
were, partly, shifts in mortality--the evidence is that life expectation at
birth was deteriorating in the early seventeenth century-- but it was
restrained even more by shifts that were taking place in fertility; quite
significant shifts. In the early seventeenth century, the rates of fertility
that can be calculated from the parish registers of parishes show that marital fertility
was falling quite sharply. That was produced, in part, by a rising age at
marriage, people were marrying later and having fewer children. But it was also
produced by a larger proportion of the population never marrying at all. It
was startling when historical demographers discovered that of the people who
were coming up to marriageable age, from the 1620s through to the 1650s, people
who&#39;d been born around 1600 to 1610, or thereabouts, as many as twenty percent,
or sometimes even more, never married. It&#39;s a quite extraordinary figure; a
very large proportion of the population remaining unmarried. What we seem to
have here is evidence of a situation in which, for those who were doing least
well in the circumstances of the time, life was too insecure, or living
standards were too marginal, for them to be able to marry and establish
independent households of their own. As a result, fertility declined;
population gradually stabilized. </p>
<p>As population stabilized, so did
prices. The great underlying dynamic of change from the second quarter of the
sixteenth century through to the mid-seventeenth century was over. But that
long dynamic of population growth, inflation and its many consequences in
economy and society, had unleashed economic changes which would not be reversed
and they had significantly reconfigured the structure of society and the
relationship between its members. </p>
<p>So, with that, I&#39;ve tried to briefly
set the scene for you, and now we can go on to look at a number of other
aspects of society and culture, starting next week with the issues of
witchcraft and popular literacy and crime.</p>
