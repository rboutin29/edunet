<p><b>Professor Keith Wrightson:
</b>So,
we&#39;re in 1646 and, as I explained last time, the development of the war,
especially between 1643 and &#39;45, had unleashed forces which could not easily be
controlled and created aims and expectations which had not originally existed
at the outbreak of war, especially the controversy concerning the future
organization of the church and the issue of &#39;liberty of conscience&#39;. Parliament
was now severely divided between those who wanted a Presbyterian church
settlement and the so-called Independents who favored liberty of conscience. With
the defeat of the King these issues were now prominent in establishing the
terms of settlement. And, as they attempted a settlement, the fundamental
differences of perception of the nature of the parliamentary cause--what it had
been, what it was now--came very much to the fore. </p>
<p>In 1646 to &#39;7, the
so-called Presbyterian group were the dominant group in parliament. They held
the initiative and in July 1646 they put to King Charles--who was now in the
north of England held by the Scots in Newcastle--they put to him the Newcastle Propositions.
Under those terms the King should take the Covenant; there should be a united
Presbyterian church of both England and Scotland; parliament was to control the
military for twenty years, which they thought was roughly the King&#39;s expected
lifetime); and fifty-eight of the King&#39;s supporters were to be exempted from
pardon on the grounds that they had committed various atrocities in the course
of the war. Charles, faced with these terms, played for time. He might have
lost militarily, but he knew that they still needed him for any settlement. Remember
what the Earl of Manchester had said back in 1644: &quot;if we beat the King ninety
and nine times, he is king still.&quot; Charles knew that. </p>
<p>In February 1647, the
Scots&#39; army was paid off by the English parliament. They handed over the King
into English custody and they withdrew back to Scotland, and the King was
brought south and lodged in a country house in Northamptonshire, northwest of
London, Holmby House, where negotiations continued. Meanwhile, the New Model Army--which
was now for the most part billeted in eastern England near Cambridge--the New Model
Army was ordered either to disband or to reenlist for service in Ireland where
the Irish confederacy was still in control. This demand provoked an army, many
of whom were already worried by the prospect of a settlement which would be
intolerant in matters of religion, and the consequences of that provocation
were momentous. </p>
<p>In April and May
1647, the cavalry regiments of the New Model elected representatives. They
were called &quot;Agitators.&quot; They elected Agitators. And a Council of the Army
was formed which consisted of the general officers, the colonels of the
regiments, and the representatives of the various regiments. Then on the 4<sup>th</sup>
of June a junior officer, Cornet Joyce, went to Holmby House and seized the King
and brought him to the army. There&#39;s a famous story that when Joyce arrived at
Holmby House the guard there asked him where his warrant was to remove the King
and he drew his pistol and said, &quot;here is my warrant.&quot; Then on the 14th
of June the army issued and printed a Declaration. They declared themselves to
be &quot;no mere mercenary army,&quot; but an army enlisted to defend &quot;our own and the
people&#39;s just rights and liberties.&quot; They demanded an Act of Oblivion to wipe
away all acts which had been committed during the war, pardon for all acts
committed; they demanded liberty for &quot;tender consciences,&quot; as they put it, in
matters of religion. And the army leaders, with the council, began drawing up
their own terms for negotiation with the King whom they now held. Then, in
late July 1647, demonstrations in London on behalf of Presbyterianism and
against the army&#39;s actions, led to the Independent members of parliament
fleeing the city. They fled to the army and asked for its protection. On the
6th of August the army marched south and occupied London, restoring them to parliament,
from which some of their Presbyterian enemies fled. </p>
<p>Now then it was the
turn of the army and the Independents in parliament to attempt a settlement
with the King, and they put to him terms which were entitled the Heads of the
Proposals. They were drawn up by Henry Ireton, a former lawyer who was the
Commissary General of the New Model, and John Lambert, one of the cavalry
colonels, and they were probably the most generous terms--well they were certainly
the most generous terms--ever offered to King Charles; remarkably so in fact. </p>
<p>The army insisted
that in future there would be a parliament elected every two years and that
control of the militia would be with parliament, but only for ten years, not twenty.
They exempted only five Royalists from pardon. They were even willing to permit
the reestablishment of a Church of England with bishops and the old prayer
book, but it should have no coercive powers over those who preferred other
forms of worship: so a reestablished Church of England but with liberty for
tender consciences. Charles&#39; aide in the negotiations, Sir John Berkeley,
urged the King to accept these proposals. He said never would a kingdom lost
be so easily recovered as on such terms, but the King temporized. Berkeley
later recorded in his memoirs that in his view the King would not agree because
he didn&#39;t trust Cromwell and Ireton and the reason he didn&#39;t trust them was
that they asked for nothing for themselves. </p>
<p>But most likely the King
was simply playing for time and secretly opening negotiations at this time with
the Scots, who were increasingly alarmed, now that they&#39;d withdrawn from
England, at what was happening in England and at the prospect of Independents
in power. Meanwhile, while this was going on a further set of proposals began
gestating amongst the Agitators in the army council and some of the officers,
and these were deeply influenced by the views of the London radical movement,
the Levellers. </p>
<p>The Levellers, led by
John Lilburne, William Walwyn, Richard Overton, and John Wildman, had emerged
initially as pamphleteers on behalf of liberty of conscience. But their
experience at the hands of an intolerant Presbyterian-dominated parliament led
them to begin questioning the whole basis of government authority and the
manner in which the hands of power might be tied in a number of respects. They
claimed in their pamphlets to speak on behalf of what they called &quot;the middle
and poorer sort of people,&quot; &quot;the hobnails, the clouted shoes, the private
soldiers, the leather and woolen aprons and all the laborious and industrious
people of England.&quot; A very distinctly populist stance. And they advanced the
claim--I&#39;m quoting--&quot;that all power is originally and essentially in the
whole body of the people of this nation&quot;: declaration of popular
sovereignty. Accordingly, they put forward proposals including a
single-chamber parliament--they would abolish the House of Lords; a
redistribution of parliamentary seats in order to make them more equitable;
elections to be held every two years with a much wider male suffrage--quite how
wide is debatable. They probably held a variety of different views at
different times. Some appear to have been for full manhood suffrage, others
for a more limited suffrage, but certainly a larger one--thorough reform of the
legal system, the laws to be simplified and to be printed in English. </p>
<p>Well, in October
1647, much of this was drawn up in a set of proposals called the Agreement of
the People, and the Agreement of the People having been debated amongst them
and printed was then put forward to the army council in a set of debates which
took place in Putney Church and they&#39;re known as the Putney Debates. We have
the full transcript of the Putney Debates and it&#39;s a quite remarkable survival.
The secretary of the army council took the whole thing down in shorthand and
this was rediscovered in the late nineteenth century and is now fully available
in print. In the Putney Debates we find fully transcribed the statements not
only of the leaders of the army council but also the independent interjections
expressing their aspirations of nameless soldiers who had been elected on
behalf of their regiments. The secretary of the army council didn&#39;t know their
names. He put them down as &quot;Buff Coat,&quot; i.e., a man wearing the thick
buff-colored leather coat of a cavalryman, or in one case &quot;Bedfordshire Man,&quot; a
man who either had a Bedfordshire accent, perhaps, or perhaps was wearing the
sash of the Bedfordshire regiment. </p>
<p>Some of the
statements made are most extraordinary ringing declarations. General Ireton,
who did most of the talking on behalf of the officers, thought that all men
should enjoy liberty under the law, but he took the view conventional for a man
of his class that the vote should only belong to people of property, those with
&quot;a permanent and fixed interest in the kingdom.&quot; In contrast to that view,
Thomas Rainborough, an artillery officer, replied, &quot;the poorest he that is
in England hath a life to live as the greatest he, and therefore, Sir, I truly
think that every man that is to live under a government ought first by his own
consent to put himself under that government.&quot; Ireton appealed to the
importance of constitutional tradition in going forward with the settlement. Trooper
Sexby urged considering &quot;the reasonableness of the thing&quot; rather than
constitutional precedent. </p>
<p>Well, the Putney
Debates are well worth reading and they provide an astonishing insight into the
ideas which were circulating in London and the army; ideas generated by the
experience of the war, by the sense of possibility which had been unleashed
among people who had been brought to ask, as several did ask in the Putney
Debates, &quot;what hath the soldier fought for?&quot; That&#39;s a phrase that
repeatedly comes to the fore in the course of the debates, and they tell us a
lot about the army leaders too. The Lord General, Thomas Fairfax, was largely
silent. Fairfax was a professional soldier, not a politician. He was famously
taciturn and he said little. He merely acted as chairman. Henry Ireton did
most of the debating. He was clear-headed, very highly intelligent, sharp. He
clearly became exasperated with what he saw as the utopian schemes being put
forward by the soldiers. At one point he replied to the question, &quot;what
hath the soldier fought for?&quot; by saying, &quot;I [will] tell you what the
soldier... has fought for... that one man&#39;s will shall not be law.&quot;
[correction: &quot;that the will of one man should not be a law&quot;] That was Ireton&#39;s
perception of the conflict, but he also declared himself willing to follow
where God might lead. Cromwell was something of a mediating figure. He said
comparatively little. It was characteristic of his manner. He tended often
when major decisions were to be made to hesitate, to wait, to wait on a sign
from God, and then when he was sure of his course of his action to take drastic
action. </p>
<p>Well, were the
general officers seriously negotiating with the representatives of the
regiments or were they just humoring the troops to maintain order and coherence
in the army while pressing ahead with their own negotiations with the King?
We&#39;ll never really know because ultimately it came to nothing. The debates
broke up inconclusively, and the reason they broke up was because of an action
on the part of the King. Charles was very much aware of the possibilities of
exploiting potential divisions on the Parliamentarian side. He was also very
fearful of the radicals and what might happen if they were to gain the
ascendancy in the army council. On the 11<sup>th</sup> of November he escaped
from custody, went south and took refuge on the Isle of Wight off the south
coast of England. There he was held by the Parliamentarian governor in
honorable custody but he was allowed to receive representatives, and they
included representatives from Scotland. </p>
<p>On the 15<sup>th</sup>
of November, faced with this situation, Fairfax and Cromwell called the army to
a rendezvous and discipline was re-imposed. Cromwell rode up and down the
ranks, plucking copies of the Agreement of the People from the hatbands of some
of the soldiers who&#39;d come with copies of the Agreement of the People in their
hats. One intransigent soldier was summarily court-martialed and shot. In
December 1647, the King, meanwhile, concluded an agreement with Scots
representatives. It was called the Engagement. In the Engagement he undertook
to accept a Presbyterian church in return for military aid and he also began
secretly negotiation--negotiating with the Irish confederacy. Shortly
afterwards in the spring of 1648 there were concerted Royalist uprisings in
various parts of the kingdom: in Wales, in South Wales, in Kent, in Essex, and
in the north in Yorkshire. Meanwhile, Charles&#39; supporters in Scotland, the
Engagers, began assembling an army for the invasion of England to deliver the King
and with that the second civil war began. </p>
<p>So, after so much
hope of a settlement, so much generosity in the terms which had been offered to
Charles in the Heads of the Proposals, this renewal of the war hardened the
hearts of the army&#39;s leaders. On the 29th of April, 1648, they called the
whole army to a general assembly at Windsor to the west of London for a prayer
meeting before they divided into various bodies, each of which was to take on
the Royalist threat in different areas of the kingdom. And the mood at Windsor
was very different from that at Putney. The mood was one of heightened
religious anxiety, anger, and expectation amongst men who had not wanted or
expected to fight again. They saw the renewal of the war as being both a
judgment from God upon their previous actions and a test of their resolve, and
they resolved that Charles was &quot;a man against whom God [correction: the
Lord] hath witnessed&quot;--I&#39;m quoting from the declaration which ended the
meeting--and therefore &quot;that it was our duty if ever the Lord brought us back to
peace to call Charles Stuart, that man of blood, to an account for that blood
he hath shed and the mischief he hath done to his utmost against the Lord&#39;s
cause and people in these poor nations.&quot; </p>
<p>And in that mood the
army departed, Fairfax to the east, Cromwell first to Wales and then to the
north where on the 17th to the 19th of July he met and utterly shattered a much
larger Scottish-Royalist army at the Battle of Preston, a hard-fought running
battle which stretched for miles along the road from Preston to Manchester. Cromwell
saw that victory as divinely ordained. In the dispatch he sent back he could
see &quot;nothing but the hand of God&quot; in it, as he put it. God had spoken again as
far as he was concerned and the army began returning slowly to London in a mood
of religious exultation, pausing in Yorkshire to mop up Royalist resistance at
Pontefract Castle before proceeding south. At the brief siege of Pontefract,
Thomas Rainborough, the Leveller, was killed.</p>
<p>But meanwhile parliament
had reopened negotiations with the King. The King was king still. This proved
too much for the officers in London. On the 6th of December, 1648, Colonel
Thomas Pride stationed troops at the entrance to the House of Commons and
conducted what&#39;s known as Pride&#39;s Purge. He refused to allow into parliament
anyone who did not sympathize with the army&#39;s cause. Parliament was reduced to
only 150 members known as the Rump. While this was going on Cromwell was
mysteriously absent. He returned to London only after Pride&#39;s Purge had been
completed. Exactly where he was isn&#39;t certain. It&#39;s possible that he&#39;d gone
home to Huntingdonshire. That&#39;s one idea. He seems to have been undergoing
one of those periods of reflection before deciding on decisive action which
were very characteristic of him; but once he came back he was prominent in
driving things ahead. On the 1<sup>st</sup> of January 1649, the Rump, the
remaining 150 members of parliament, set up a high court of justice to try the King.
The House of Lords refused to participate. The House of Commons therefore
declared that its own decisions would have the force of law since &quot;the people
are, under God, the original of all just power.&quot; On the 20th of January,
Charles I was arraigned. The charge--I&#39;m quoting--declaring him to be &quot;a
tyrant, a traitor, a murderer, and a public and implacable enemy to the
Commonwealth of England.&quot; </p>
<p>The King with great
dignity attended his trial in Westminster Hall but refused to recognize the
authority of the court. He was condemned. On the 29th of January, only fifty-nine
of the more than 150 members of the court could be prevailed upon to actually
sign the King&#39;s death warrant. And then the following day the King was
executed on a scaffold outside his banqueting hall in Whitehall Palace. It&#39;s
still there today, the Banqueting Hall, the only surviving building of
Whitehall Palace. If you visit it, the room that you enter on the first floor
is the former banqueting hall itself. The ceiling is decorated with a
wonderful painting by Rubens of the apotheosis of King James I. Charles&#39;
father is shown ascending into heaven. It&#39;s a wonderful artistic statement of
divine right monarchy, and ironically it was under that painting that Charles
walked to step out from the window on to the scaffold, wearing two shirts
because it was a cold January day in case he should shiver and people might
think he was afraid. He met his death with great dignity, perhaps knowing that
this was the best thing he could do for the monarchy, to die well, and so he
did. And as his head was struck off one witness says that from the crowd there
came &quot;such a groan as I never heard before.&quot; </p>
<p>It&#39;s ironic for those
of us who live in New Haven that in Broadway we have a high Anglo-Catholic
Episcopalian church which is one of those that recognizes the execution of King
Charles I, commemorates it as a martyrdom for the Episcopal church, and we have
running from Broadway three streets named after three of the men who signed his
death warrant, Goffe, Whalley, and Dixwell. So the fingerprints of these
events are here.</p>
<p>What next? They had
tried and they had failed to reach a settlement with the King. Could they
achieve one without him? Well, it was attempted. In March 1649, parliament
declared the monarchy and the House of Lords abolished. In May 1649, England
was declared &quot;a Commonwealth and Free State.&quot; All writs were to run in the name
not of the King but of the &quot;keepers of the liberties of England.&quot; A new great
seal was made for the kingdom which bore a picture not of the King but of the
House of Commons in session surrounded around the edge with the legend &quot;In
the first year of freedom by God&#39;s blessing restored.&quot; </p>
<p>Well, perhaps in time
those lofty aspirations might have acquired some real substance, but for the
moment the fact was that this was a regime run by a committed minority
supported by a somewhat larger body who were willing to conform to its
authority out of pragmatism or for the sake of order or out of mere political
opportunism. But despite its lofty claims the survival of the regime depended
ultimately upon the army and the army of course had an agenda of its own. Above
all, defense of liberty of conscience for the godly and the pursuit of a rather
vaguely defined &#39;godly reformation&#39; in the kingdom. </p>
<p>These tensions were
initially disguised by the fact that there was an immediate need to defend the
new regime. In 1649 to &#39;50, parliament undertook the re-conquest of Ireland to
prevent its use as a base by Charles II, now aged nineteen and in exile--and
that re-conquest was brutally initiated by Cromwell himself. Cromwell was now
appointed lord general since Sir Thomas Fairfax, after the execution of the King,
in which he had no part, was not willing to go any further and retired. Cromwell
blundered in to Ireland with very little understanding of the complexities of
the Irish situation and blinded by the 1641 propaganda stereotype of the
barbarities committed by the Irish rebels. At the fortress town of Drogheda
near Dublin in 1649, a massacre of the defenders of Drogheda was committed. This
was justified by the laws of war. They had refused to surrender honorably and,
under the laws of war at the time, a city taken by assault, with the losses
that that involved, would be one which would be permitted no quarter. Nevertheless,
it was an act probably partly fueled by religious bigotry and zeal. Cromwell
himself in the dispatch he sent back to England after Drogheda appears troubled
by what he had ordered. It has a very defensive tone. Nonetheless, it was
done and it initiated a bloody pacification of Ireland which continued for two
years and culminated in confiscations of land from Irish landowners and the
founding of a Protestant ascendancy in Ireland with the land being granted to
adventurers, who had given money for the re-conquest, and soldiers. It didn&#39;t
create the Protestant Ireland they envisaged. It created a deeply divided
society dominated by British landowners and the roots of the subsequent
animosity which remains even in the current fragile peace. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 1650
Charles II landed in Scotland where he was crowned king. Cromwell moved north
to campaign there against Charles. On the 3rd of September 1650, he took on
the army of the Covenant at the Battle of Dunbar. Heavily outnumbered, his
troops hungry and many of them sick, and nevertheless by a brilliant tactic of
attacking the center of the Scottish line and splitting it they won an
unexpected victory. Again Cromwell exulted. &quot;The Lord hath done
this,&quot; he said in his dispatch. A second Scottish invasion force was
formed in the west and moved south. Cromwell then chased it down the east,
moved across and met them at Worcester a year after Dunbar where again on the 3rd
of September, exactly a year later, they were completely defeated. The Battle
of Worcester was described by Cromwell as &quot;the crowning mercy.&quot; Charles II,
who had been with that army, fled in to exile again, after the famous incident
in which he hid in an oak tree at Boscobel House while Parliamentarian soldiers
searched the grounds beneath for him; a story he liked to tell later after he&#39;d
been restored to the crown. </p>
<p>By 1653, the Commonwealth
of England, Scotland, and Ireland created by these military actions and
conquest constituted the first all-British state, and meanwhile in 1652 to &#39;4 a
victorious naval war was fought against the Dutch. Initially, at the very
foundation of the English Commonwealth the idea had been put forward of forming
a union with the Dutch republic. That had been rejected and subsequent
quarrels, the Dutch sheltering of Charles, and trade rivalry led to a brief
naval war in which the Commonwealth was victorious. So, by 1653, the Commonwealth
was militarily triumphant. Its forces, now battle hardened and possessed of
the extraordinary morale which had come from victory after victory, were
apparently invincible. </p>
<p>But with the peace,
tensions re-surfaced. This was not the popular regime which had been envisaged
by the Levellers. It was not the godly regime which had been envisaged by
Cromwell. The Rump had passed a Toleration Act in 1650 granting toleration and
religious sects of all kinds proliferated, as you know. Some steps had been
taken to improve the financial position of the clergy in the church to get a
better quality of clergy and some cosmetic reforms had been made to the law.
But apart from that the Rump showed little reforming zeal. There was also a
good deal of suspicion in the army that the members of the Rump planned to
perpetuate themselves forever. There was talk that when a seat fell vacant
they would hold what were called &quot;recruiter&quot; elections for a single
constituency rather than holding a general election for the election of an
entirely new parliament. The army didn&#39;t like that. </p>
<p>Finally, on the 20<sup>th</sup>
of April 1653, when it appeared that the Rump was about to go ahead with that
scheme Cromwell, who had been waiting patiently, precipitously acted. He stood
up in parliament, called in troops, and dissolved the Rump, famously declaring
as he drove them out of their chamber, &quot;Begone. You have sat here too long for
all the good you do [correction: have been doing].&quot; Well, what followed
in the next five years was a series of constitutional experiments in which
Cromwell, who now held supreme power, attempted to divest himself of that power,
but at the same time retained the right to intervene when necessary to defend
what he took to be the central cause, which to him meant above all liberty of
conscience and rule by men of &quot;godly and honest conversation,&quot; as he put it. </p>
<p>The trouble was that
too few others in the nation shared his aspirations and, as he later remarked
to Bulstrode Whitelocke, one of his advisers, &quot;I am as much for government
by consent as any man but where will I find that consent?&quot; His first
attempt was to win consent by establishing a reforming government and a
so-called Nominated Parliament of 140 members was established to promote godly
reform. The members were simply nominated. Cromwell described this as &quot;a door
to usher in those things that God hath promised.&quot; He was quite enthusiastic
about the idea. It was the brainchild of one of his officers, Major General
Thomas Harrison. This parliament, the Nominated Parliament, sometimes known as
&#39;Barebone&#39;s Parliament&#39; after one of its members, sat between July and December
1653 and it did indeed begin to consider radical reforms in the law and the
abolition of compulsory tithes in church. But even in a parliament of godly
men such steps occasioned too much anxiety for most of the members. In
December 1643, while some of the more radical members were attending a prayer
meeting more conservative members of the Nominated Parliament seized the moment
and dissolved themselves and handed the power back to Cromwell. </p>
<p>Next, between 1654
and 1657, they attempted government under a constitution called the Instrument
of Government. This was based on the Heads of the Proposals which had been put
to the King in 1647. Cromwell was head of state with the title of Lord Protector.
Government was to be in the hands of the Lord Protector advised by a council
of state, parliaments were to be elected every three years, and the Lord Protector
was denied the power to delay any legislation for more than thirty days. This
provided a measure of stability, but when the first parliament met under the
Instrument of Government in 1654 it immediately began to attack both the Instrument
itself and the religious toleration which was so dear to Cromwell&#39;s heart. Consequently,
he dissolved it at the first opportunity. </p>
<p>In 1655, the risk of
a royalist uprising and a small attempted uprising in the West Country led to
the experiment of appointing regional military governors to govern the country.
Major Generals were appointed for a variety of English regions. They were to
oversee government and to promote godly reformation. This measure was bitterly
resented by the county gentry and when parliament met again in 1656 they
violently attacked it as &quot;sword government.&quot; Cromwell gave way. Then in
February 1657 parliament presented him with what was called the Humble Petition
and Advice, a call upon him to restore the ancient constitution and to accept
the crown. He took three months to think about it and then in May 1657
rejected the offer of the crown. He used the phrase &quot;I will not build
Jericho again.&quot; &quot;I will not build Jericho again.&quot; But he accepted all
the rest. The Protector with a council and triennial parliaments was
continued, but the ancient constitution was largely restored including a
so-called Other House, a kind of House of Lords of nominated members. </p>
<p>Well, Cromwell&#39;s
rejection of the crown when it was actually offered to him is perhaps a test of
his personal integrity, but the truth was that as Lord Protector he was king in
all but name. He was probably sincere in seeing himself as he described
himself as &quot;a good constable set to keep the peace of the parish,&quot; and above
all to preserve God&#39;s cause of religious toleration. Domestically, his rule
was relatively mild. Roman Catholics were not persecuted. He was much
preoccupied with &quot;healing and settling.&quot; He employed many ex-royalists if they
would accept his government. Abroad he was successful. The Protectorate took
part in a brief war against Spain which involved the capture of Jamaica and
also the distinction of the New Model Army defeating the Spanish army at the
Battle of Dunkirk. But it was not government by consent and to many of the
political nation Cromwell remained an unforgivable regicide. To some of those
who had been his former allies he appeared to be a hypocritical opportunist. John
Lilburne, the former Leveller, said of Cromwell, he &quot;will weep, howl and call
upon the Lord even while he doth smite thee under the first rib.&quot; To
still more people in the country he appeared to be the protector not of tender
consciences and English liberties but of wild religious sectaries and fanatics
who threatened to turn the world upside down and bring confusion in society,
above all the Quakers who in their early, more radical phase, caused great
alarm as they spread their message across the kingdom. And ultimately everyone
knew that the entire regime still depended above all upon the swords of the New
Model Army, an army which was increasingly an army of professionals. Only
Cromwell himself could hold it all together by the curious blend of pragmatism
and militancy which characterized him and by of course the intense devotion
which he inspired in his troops. And then on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of September
1658, aged exactly fifty-nine, he suddenly died. </p>
<p>Well, the rest of the
story can be swiftly told. In 1659, following Cromwell&#39;s death it all
collapsed. He was succeeded as Protector temporarily by his inadequate son,
Richard. Parliament refused to recognize Richard&#39;s authority. In May 1659,
under pressure from the generals, Richard resigned, and the Rump Parliament was
recalled. In October 1659, General John Lambert, dissatisfied with its
proceedings, dissolved the Rump again. There was the threat of chaos in the
kingdom. In December 1659, General George Monck, commander in chief in Scotland,
decided to intervene. He marched his troops south to restore authority. That
meant first of all, after he arrived in London, restoring the Rump, and then in
February 1660 readmitting to parliament all survivors of the Long Parliament of
1640. All of them who were still alive, all those who had been expelled for
various reasons, were permitted to resume their seats. By now almost everyone
expected the restoration of the monarchy. </p>
<p>In March 1660, the
Long Parliament voted to dissolve itself at last, and to hold free elections. In
April 1660, Charles II appealed from exile in the Netherlands in an attempt to
allay the anxieties of his former opponents and issued the Declaration of
Breda, in which he said that if restored he would promise to respect the
liberties of parliament, he would rule by the law, he would extend a free
pardon to all former enemies, and he would grant liberty of conscience. This
seemed to allay all anxieties. In April 1660, the so-called Convention
Parliament met, complete with a House of Lords, and on the 8<sup>th</sup> of
May Charles II was recognized as king. A few weeks later on the 25<sup>th</sup>
of May he was brought home on a battleship, the flagship of the navy ironically
named the Naseby after the battle at which his father had lost the first civil
war. It was swiftly renamed the Royal Sovereign. </p>
<p>So the revolution was
over. It had been defeated, or one could say it had defeated itself. But it
would never be forgotten and it left a legacy. First of all, the restored
monarchy under Charles II lived under the shadow of the events of the 1640s. These
could never be forgotten. There were tacit understandings about the acceptable
limits of royal authority and the Stuarts would do well to remember them. Secondly,
the politicization of a much larger section of society, which had been part and
parcel of the dynamic of the dramatic events of the 1640s and 1650s, was not
reversed; it remained. Thirdly, the Church of England could never again
encompass the sheer diversity of English Protestantism. The Church of England
was restored, but religious dissent was an enduring fact throughout the
kingdom. And finally there was a fourth legacy, what Professor Lawrence Stone
described as &quot;an immensely rich reservoir of ideas that were to echo and
re-echo down the ages.&quot; Those ideas, political ideas, religious ideas,
generated by the events and the dilemmas of the 1640s and the 1650s, were in a
sense what really made the English Revolution the first of the great European
and Atlantic revolutions, and of course you will be discussing those ideas in
section. As John Davenport put it, observing all this from afar in 1647 at the
height of it all, &quot;the light which is now discovered in England... will
never be wholly put out though I suspect that contrary opinions will prevail
for a time.&quot; He was right. </p>
<p>Okay. Oliver
Cromwell&#39;s head; we have time. Following the Restoration, Cromwell&#39;s body was
exhumed. He died of course in 1658. The body had been embalmed and he&#39;d been
buried in state. His body was exhumed along with that of Henry Ireton and they
were gibbeted--the bodies were gibbeted in public--and Cromwell&#39;s head was
struck off. It was put on a spike high on the walls of Westminster Hall, where
it remained for over twenty years until in a gale in 1684 it disappeared. It&#39;s
thought that it was probably blown down and one of the guards took it and sold
it. It resurfaced in the eighteenth century in the cabinet of curiosities of a
gentleman, then vanished again for a while. It resurfaced again at the end of
the eighteenth century when it was put on public exhibition and people paid to
see it. Then later on in the nineteenth century it came in to the possession
of a scholarly antiquarian clergyman who looked after it and passed it down in
his family. </p>
<p>Eventually, in the
early twentieth century it was offered to his former college, Sidney Sussex
College, Cambridge. Extensive forensic examination was done of the head to see
if it was genuine. Well, it was a head--there&#39;s no doubt about that--[laughter]
but it was extensively forensically examined and an extensive report was
prepared. Well, they decided that the balance of probability was that it was
indeed Cromwell&#39;s head. It has a spike through it for a start, which is really
[laughter] one clue. It had been embalmed. There are still
scraps of skin and hair. The--there was other forensic evidence consistent
with Cromwell&#39;s death mask--a plaster mask had been taken of his face after his
death--and there was even pitting on the skull in places where his face was
famously disfigured by prominent warts. So they decided it probably was
Cromwell&#39;s head and it was eventually reburied in--almost 300 years after it
had been exhumed--in Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where it&#39;s still there. Only
the master of Sidney Sussex and the dean of the college chapel knows exactly
where. </p>
<p>It&#39;s a closely
guarded secret. I knew someone who was elected master of Sidney Sussex a few
years ago and did suggest that it would be nice to know but I was told very
politely to get lost. [Laughter] So it&#39;s a closely guarded
secret. It&#39;s still there. So if you go to Cambridge and visit Sidney Sussex
College and go in to the chapel area where it&#39;s probably buried you may be
walking over Cromwell&#39;s head. Meanwhile, in the hall of Sidney Sussex beside
the high table they have a portrait of Cromwell, &quot;warts and all.&quot; He famously
told a portrait painter that he didn&#39;t want to be prettied up, paint me &quot;warts
and all,&quot; he said. And he is there and the portrait has curtains and if a
member of the royal family happens to visit Sidney Sussex, which happens from
time to time, they draw the curtains across Cromwell&#39;s portrait in order not to
cause embarrassment. But the rest of the time the curtains are open and he
looks down on the students of his former college, who probably know little of
his career, but there he is and make of him what you will, either a cynical,
power-hungry, hypocritical opportunist, or the defender of what people still
refer to as the &quot;good old cause,&quot; or, as one biographer described him, &quot;God&#39;s
Englishman,&quot; but there we are. </p>
<p>So next week we&#39;ll
turn to the Restoration regime. </p>
