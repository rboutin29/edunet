<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>Professor Wai Chee Dimock introduces the class to Hemingway’s novel <em>To Have and Have Not</em>, which originally appeared as a series of short stories in <em>Cosmopolitan</em> and <em>Esquire</em> magazines. She focuses on Hemingway’s designation of taxanomic groups (“types”) by race, class, and sexuality, arguing that Hemingway’s switch of narrative perspectives throughout the course of the novel casts every character, even protagonist Harry Morgan, as a classifiable kind of human being. In her treatment of types, she shows how Hemingway draws thematic parallels between seemingly disparate racial types, complicating the dualism of “to have” and “have not” that appears in the title.<strong></strong></p><p><em>Warning: This lecture contains graphic content and/or adult language that some users may find disturbing.</em></p>
