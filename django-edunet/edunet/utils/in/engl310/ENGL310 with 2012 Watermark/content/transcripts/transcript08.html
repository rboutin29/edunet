<p><b>Professor Langdon Hammer</b>: Last Wednesday, talking about the
poetry of World War I, we were talking about poems written in the
period 1914 to 1918, pretty much the period of the First World War.
This is a period that we've already had a certain amount to say about.
It is the period in which Frost starts writing, publishes <i>A Boy's
Will</i> in London and then <i>North of Boston</i> in 1915. It's the
same period in which Yeats's work undergoes its important stylistic
shift in development in the volume called <i>Responsibilities</i> and
other books from the teens exemplified in that little poem "A Coat." It
is a period in which, in London itself, are gathered Frost, Yeats,
Pound and Eliot – all poets we'll study – not simply gathered but
interacting, talking to each other, reading each other's work and
giving each other ideas and criticism.</p>

<p>Another figure in this milieu and of this moment is the poet H.D.
Here, she is in a photo from 1915 with a locket in a poetical pose.
Let's see, I've some other photos of the poet here. Let's see. This is
as an older woman and in a familiar place, seated. She's on the left,
well, on your left, my right, with her companion Brhyer right here. And
that nice man in the middle is one of my predecessors in this position,
Norman Holmes Pearson, a professor of modern poetry: one of the
founders of American Studies at Yale and one of the people involved in
the creation of the incredible archive of modern poetry in the Beinecke
Library, where we have the papers of Ezra Pound; H.D.; lots of
materials from Williams; Langston Hughes; and many other figures. Let's
see, there she is on her seventieth birthday in the nave of Sterling
Memorial Library. Well, and this is over in the Beinecke, too. That is
her death mask.</p>

<p>Well, we've gone a long way from that young woman with the locket to
this point. Let's return to her in her youth. This is also over in the
Beinecke. It's a photo of H.D., and it is inscribed, "To Marianne
Moore," her friend and Pound's friend. On your handout, you'll see the
interesting anecdote relayed from Hilda Doolittle's
<i>Autobiographies</i>:</p>

<blockquote>I had never heard of <i>vers</i> <i>libre</i> until I was
discovered by Ezra Pound. [Pound did a lot for modern poetry, including
naming H.D.] I did a few poems that I don't think Ezra liked, but later
he was beautiful about my first authentic verses and sent my poems in
for me to Miss Monroe. [That is Harriet Monroe, the editor, a very
powerful woman, of <i>Poetry</i> magazine.] He signed them for me,
"H.D., Imagiste." The name seems to have stuck somehow. [H.D.,
<i>Autobiographies</i>]</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Well, this is a wonderful anecdote, sometimes told differently, in
which Pound and H.D. – as she would come to be known – were conversing
about her poems in a coffee shop. And Pound put at the end of H.D.'s
poems a new signature to them ("H.D.," that is) and at the same time
named the kind of poet she was ("Imagiste") and promptly, since Pound
is a great entrepreneur, sent the poems off to be published and to
found a movement. It's an interesting and telling story. I suppose
if--This was <i>Poetry</i> magazine, its cover, where you see poems by
Pound and others that included H.D.'s work in the same volume.</p>

<p>There are a couple of things to be said about this little anecdote.
First of all, there's the kind of complicated literary exchange of a
man telling a woman what to call herself, and, in fact, doing it for
her and sending it, her name and her work, to be published. The name
"Imagiste" is funny.&nbsp;It seems to, well, it seems to evoke
something excitingly and pretentiously foreign. And you could remember
the force of French painting in this period. You know, everything that
was modern came from Paris, it seemed. And here is Pound trying to, in
effect, create something, some similar kind of public relations
excitement for poetry. "Imagiste" highlights, well, it highlights the
word "image," and it highlights the visual, as if poetry were a kind of
painting. That's important. And then there's the fact of Hilda
Doolittle's transformation into H.D. I don't know. Is the name Hilda
Doolittle insufficiently poetic? The compression of that kind of
wonderfully homely American name into the enigmatic initials "H.D."
seems emblematic of Imagist aesthetics in general, which depend on the
radical compression of language and the conversion of, well, the
prosaic and everyday to the essential. And you could say that here
Pound is trying to do something with the same ideal of extreme economy
with H.D.'s name.</p>

<p>What was Imagism? This is a, well, these are copies of H.D.'s poems
as they appeared in <i>Poetry</i> magazine, the poem "Hermes of the
Ways." H.D. was – and there's her initials right here, this new pen
name she went under – she is writing, even in this very early phase,
poems that have classical subjects and antecedents and are sometimes,
in fact, translations from classical sources from the Greek anthology
and others. Here is one, "Epigram," after the Greek, and then here's
H.D.'s name followed by the "Imagiste," in quotation marks,
identification that Pound has introduced. Imagism was, initially,
marketed – I think that's the fair word to use – in a series of
anthologies that collected this new, exciting, representatively, it
seemed, modern poetry in an anthology called <i>Des
Imagistes</i>--again French-ified. And then, you can see this is from
1914, and it's published in London and New York. And then, well, I'll
tell you its table of contents. It's got poems by H.D.'s friend and
lover, also a soldier poet, Richard Aldington, H.D. herself, F.S. Flint
and others, including Amy Lowell and William Carlos Williams. James
Joyce appears here, and Ezra Pound, who here has at least a couple of
poems that you've read for today.</p>

<p>This was followed a little bit later by this book called <i>Some
Imagist Poets</i> in 1915. At this point, Pound is no longer the master
entrepreneur, and the movement has rather been taken over by the very
amply represented Amy Lowell who has become the primary exponent of
Imagism already by 1915. And Pound has more or less despaired of his
own creation, Imagism, and now complains of it as being merely
"Amygism," as he referred to it. Amy, well, you can see in this a kind
of, oh you know, envy and competition on Pound's part. He's unhappy
that his little group has been taken over by Amy Lowell, and so he
doesn't want to have anything to do with it. Amy Lowell herself would
later become distressed at the proliferation of Imagism and Imagists
and attempt to copyright the name, which she was unable to do. Well,
this was her longest statement of poetics, presented as a preface to
that volume, and I recommend it to you. It's an interesting statement
of Imagism.</p>

<p>And here's a photo of Pound from the same period. Pound, despite Amy
Lowell's taking over of Imagism, remains the real theorist of Imagism
and the one whose formulations we still return to in order to
understand what Imagism was and, to an extent, to understand some of
the essential aesthetic ideas and criteria of modern poetry. On our
handout, you have Pound's rules – he liked to make rules – for writing
an Imagist poem. Happily, there are just three of them, not too
many:</p>

<blockquote>(1) Direct treatment of the "thing," whether subjective or
objective.<br />
<br />
(2) To use absolutely no word that did not contribute to the
presentation. [We can see even in his telegraphic rules here he's
trying to be economical. And:]<br />
<br />
(3) As regarding rhythm: to compose in sequence of the musical phrase,
not in sequence of the metronome.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Well, these are each suggestive and, as I say, important ideas. And
they're worth dwelling on to understand some of what directs Pound's
thinking and some of Pound's important influence early on in the
development of modern poetry. First of all, that focus on the "thing."
A poem is imagined here as an image of a thing. There's a kind of
empiricism in this, isn't there? A kind of vaguely scientific language.
And if you look in Pound's retrospect, when he goes back and reprints
some of his writing about Imagism and reflects on it in that essay
that's in the back of your anthology, you'll see Pound talking about
his wish to ally poetry with science rather than advertisement. And
here you can see him really trying to do so in this stress on
objectivity or the aim or objectivity. Notice that the "thing" may be,
as he says, "subjective or objective." But when we call it a "thing,"
this has the effect of turning even the subjective into something
objective, something oddly objective. And there's also, in that first
rule, a kind of emphasis on directness, you know, direct treatment of
the thing. That's important.</p>

<p>All this leads to, in Pound's second principle there, the idea of
concision, of efficiency. Nothing that does "not contribute to the
presentation": you know, "Hilda Doolittle, your name is too long; H.D."
"Presentation"; Pound doesn't say "representation." He says,
"presentation." Again, there's an emphasis on immediacy, directness, an
ideal of presence, if you will. There is, in Pound, a will to override
or do away with mediation, to bypass, in a way, the medium; to make the
word a thing; to make the word an image and the image a thing. "Direct"
also implies a kind of stripping down of rhetorical ornament – the
idea, again, that we saw in Frost that the truth is something you
arrive at through reduction, or in Yeats's little poem "A Coat." And
remember that Yeats and Frost are coming to these ideas at just the
same time that Pound is finding these formulations for his own poetics.
These ideas in Frost, in Stevens--excuse me, in Frost, in Yeats – not
in Stevens, importantly – and here centrally expressed by Pound, these
ideas all point to a kind of radical skepticism in modern poetry
towards imagination and towards rhetoric. There's a skepticism about
poetry's own illusion-making powers. There's a kind of linguistic
skepticism here. And good poetry has a kind of ascetic dimension for
Pound, or so it seems at this point.</p>

<p>Finally, that third point about prosody, that's important too: what
Pounds calls the kind of priority of "the musical phrase" over "the
sequence of the metronome," the musical phrase over a kind of bigger
and regularized pattern. That's a kind of privileging of the part, the
smaller thing over the whole and certainly over repetition. It's a
privileging of individual detail over pattern or sequence. It's a
privileging of this idea of the musical phrase over the abstract, or a
kind of continuous structure, which is viewed as a kind of mechanical
discipline. All of these ideas are rehearsed, again, by Amy Lowell, and
given sometimes somewhat different emphases. And you can compare her
account.</p>

<p>Well, let's look at some of H.D.'s poems to see Imagism at work, as
it were, at least as practiced by H.D. A number of the early poems here
in your anthology come from her book, <i>Sea Garden</i>, a wonderful
and fascinating first book that imagines the poems themselves as
constituting together a kind of, well, sea garden – a kind of enclosed
space – that offers reflection on symbolic objects that suggest a kind
of allegory of poetic activity for H.D. in which flowers stand for kind
of poems, certainly kinds of feeling. And the garden itself constitutes
a certain kind of pastoral, imaginative space. And H.D. has classical
sources for this, Greek models for this. And the crucial poet for her
is Sappho. And like Sappho, H.D. is a lyric poet of sexual desire. You
can see her translation of Sappho's fragment 68 on page 389. Let's look
at the poem "Garden" on page 396, which gives a sense of H.D.'s
aesthetic--ascetic, aesthetic program. Here, there's an address to the
rose, the traditional symbol of romantic beauty:</p>

<blockquote><i>I</i><br />
<br />
You are clear<br />
 O rose, cut in rock,<br />
 hard as the descent of hail.<br />
<br />
I could scrape the colour<br />
 from the petals<br />
 like spilt dye from a rock.<br />
<br />
If I could break you<br />
 I could break a tree.<br />
 If I could stir<br />
 I could break a tree--<br />
 I could break you.<br />
<br />
<i>II</i><br />
<br />
 O wind, rend open the heat,<br />
 cut apart the heat,<br />
 rend it to tatters.<br />
<br />
 Fruit cannot drop<br />
 through this thick air--<br />
 fruit cannot fall into heat<br />
 that presses up and blunts<br />
 the points of pears<br />
 and rounds the grapes.<br />
<br />
 Cut the heat--<br />
 plow through it,<br />
 turning it on either side<br />
 of your path.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>The rose, image of romantic beauty: you could compare it to the rose
in Yeats's early poems. But here the image is transformed. H.D.'s
emphasis is not on its softness or sweetness or sensual abundance, its
richness of color or touch. Instead, the rose is "clear" and "hard,"
just as an Imagist poem is supposed to be. It is cut in rock. You could
compare it to "Sea Rose" on page 395, the page before:</p>

<blockquote>Rose, harsh rose,<br />
 marred with stint of petals,<br />
 meager flower, thin,<br />
 sparse of leaf, [where again, it seems H.D. is writing about her
poem<br />
 and its properties]<br />
 …<br />
<br />
 Stunted, with small leaf,<br />
 you are flung on the sand,<br />
 you are lifted<br />
 in the crisp sand<br />
 that drives in the wind.<br />
 Can the spice-rose<br />
 drip such acrid fragrance<br />
 hardened in a leaf?"</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>This is a poetry that wishes to convey to us an acrid fragrance in
hardened forms. In "Garden," too, H.D. is interested in a kind of
experience that is harsh or astringent, that would open itself to
elemental forces – here represented by the wind – forces that suggest
human passion as much as weather, and that would transform the poet's
torpor and heat and do so specifically through the action of cutting,
which is important. Here, and really in all these early poems, H.D.'s
poems take place as a kind of lyric drama of apostrophe: that is, the
act of address through which a speaker finds her voice by speaking in
some relation to a part of the object world; speaking to a thing, which
she identifies with or struggles against or both, as is the case, I
think, in the poems I've just read. Here, too, you could see these
images in H.D.'s poems as, in some sense, things "subjective or
objective," to take Pound's phrase. The extreme compression of these
poems expresses a kind of wish for intensity, as if by compacting
things you made them more fierce--sometimes a wish for breaking or
cutting, and, you might say, fragmenting of things to get down to
essential parts; to do away with the, let's say, lassitude of mere
rhetoric; and to cut to what is essential.</p>

<p>Well, "Oread" is maybe H.D.'s most famous poem from her early work
and a poem often presented as a paradigm of Imagism. If so, it makes us
see Imagism in somewhat different terms from those Pound presented. It
is, like the other poems I've just been discussing, a kind of dramatic
monologue, which was not something that Pound's ideas emphasized. Here
"Oread" is the name for a wood nymph, and it indicates the speaker of
the poem who says:</p>

<blockquote>Whirl up, sea--<br />
 Whirl your pointed pines,<br />
 Splash your great pines<br />
 On our rocks,<br />
 Hurl your green over us,<br />
 Cover us with your pools of fir.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Again, there's a kind of lyric act of apostrophe, of address, where
what is implored would be a kind of overwhelming experience. Who or
what exactly is Oread? Is this nymph addressing? It's hard to say. Is
she speaking, in fact, to the sea as she seems to be? "Whirl up, sea--…
/ splash your great pines over us." Or is she speaking to the woods and
the pines as if they were the sea? It's hard to decide. It is a poem
that presents a kind of enigma on that level and doesn't resolve the
question it provokes. The very brevity of the poem expresses a kind of
wish for intensity that is right on the edge of canceling the poem, you
could say, leaving us nothing there at all. A speaker, in this case,
who wishes to be covered up, to be subject to a greater force. And the
poem leaves us with this cognitive problem, the difficulty of
identifying what is figure or ground, what is literal or what is
metaphor. That is, whether she is speaking to sea or pines, seeing the
sea like pines or the pines like the sea. "The Pool" is another
enigmatic poem here, one that poses questions.</p>

<p>Well, this problem that "Oread" raises is, in fact, one that you see
in other Imagist poems, the question of what is literal and what is
figurative. Pound, again, theorizes this--the effects that I'm trying
to describe. In the middle quotation on your handout, he speaks of the
idea of instantaneity or suddenness. He talks about the poem as
constituting a "complex" of elements held together, made in some sense
simultaneous with one another; rather, you know, as "Oread" holds sea
and pines together in a way that asks us to see these elements as
joined. Pound says:</p>

<blockquote>An "Image" is that which presents an intellectual and
emotional complex in an instant of time. [And when he uses that word
"complex," it has, perhaps, certain resonances from psychoanalysis and
also, perhaps, from chemistry.] It is the presentation of such a
"complex" instantaneously which gives that sense of sudden liberation;
that sense of freedom from time limits and space limits; that sense of
sudden growth, which we experience in the presence of the greatest
works of art. [And then he says (one of my favorite quotations):] It is
better to present one image in a lifetime than to produce voluminous
works [Pound, "A Few Donts by an Imagist," <i>Poetry</i>]</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>You could see "Oread" as a poem wishing for and seeking that "sense
of sudden liberation" that Pound talks about here. It's important,
again, that Pound emphasizes presentation. It is the presentation
rather than the representation of such a complex, as he describes it.
How is presentation different from representation? For Pound, the
literary image is not a memory of a prior reality, a reflection; but is
rather something more like a new experience itself. Not an imitation of
a thing, but itself a kind of thing. Again, in Pound, as Pound thinks
about these things, there's a drive specifically through technique to
arrive at a kind of transparency beyond technique. This is also, it
should be emphasized, a Romantic project. The image gives a kind of
epiphany, a visionary experience, for both poet and reader; gives us
sudden liberation from historical particularities of place and of
time.</p>

<p>Let's look at Pound's own poem "In a Station of the Metro," which is
on page 351 as an important test case and example for this poetics. It
has the honor of being the shortest famous poem in modern poetry. You
can memorize it. "In a Station of the Metro" and wonderfully, when I've
said the title I've already said a third of the poem:</p>

<blockquote>The apparition of these faces in the crowd;<br />
 Petals on a wet, black bough.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>"In a Station of the Metro." "The apparition of these faces in the
crowd," semicolon, "petals on a wet, black bough." Not many elements.
The title--how does it function? It functions as a kind of locator. It
places us somewhere. It places us specifically in the Paris
underground, in a station of the metro. As I said, that title really
is, well, you could understand it as standing outside the poem or
really as a part of the poem itself. Lines one and two, again, pose for
us this question of, "what is the figure and what is ground?" What is
being observed and what is the metaphor it is generating? Are we, in
fact; is Pound observing faces and comparing them to petals on a wet,
black bough? Is he seeing both those things in some sense? We have here
two elements joined and compressed, radically. Probably, it's wrong to
speak here of metaphor or, for that matter, simile. But rather, we can
use the word that Pound uses, "image," or, as he would later call it,
"ideogram," borrowing from his ideas about Chinese writing.</p>

<p>The key to this poem, as to other Poundian poems, is syntax. Syntax
is the temporal ordering of language, the ordering of a sentence's
unfolding and consequently the definition of its elements and the
relationships among them. Pound has here a kind of abbreviated
parataxis, that is, a syntax of series. Here, only two elements are in
that series. The series is joined by an "and," usually. But here there
is no "and." Here, the syntax is compressed in the service of rendering
what is, in effect, a new kind of perception: a perception that is
modern, urban, of the crowd, momentary; but also, as Pound conceives
it, timeless, pointing us allusively to historical and cultural
overlays. We're in Paris, but this literary form draws on Japanese
verse models and Japanese pictorial aesthetics. The time is now, the
present, "these faces." This is self-consciously an image or picture of
modernity, but it's also the picture of an underground that inevitably
recalls the classical underworld and so also recalls the long poetic
history of comparing dead souls to leaves, which you find in Homer,
Virgil, Dante, Milton. Here, it's as if an epic simile from one of
those great poems had been taken out and presented to us in fragmentary
form. All of this, this kind of rich, allusive overlay, is created
through a kind of stripping down to the poem's essential, primary
elements. Pound gives us the story of the poem's composition here,
which, whether it's true or not, is an important poetic fable that
stands behind this poem. He says:</p>

<blockquote>Three years ago [in your footnote] in Paris, I got out of a
'metro' train at La Concorde, and saw suddenly a beautiful face, and
then another and another, and then a beautiful child's face, and then
another beautiful woman, [you know, a whole series] and I tried all
that day to find words for what this had meant to me, and I could not
find any words that seemed to me worthy, or as lovely as that sudden
emotion. [Again, suddenness.] And that evening… I was still trying and
I found, suddenly, [another experience of suddenness] the expression. I
do not mean that I found words, but there came an equation… not in
speech, but in little splotches of colour…. The 'one-image poem' is a
form of a super-position, that is to say, it is one idea getting out of
the impasse in which I had been left by my metro emotion. I wrote a
30-line poem and destroyed it…. Six months later I made a poem half
that length; a year later I made the following <i>hokku</i>-like
[haiku-like] sentence.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So there, interestingly, this poem that purports to present – and
"present," again, is the right word rather than "represent" – a moment
of intense, vivid spontaneous emotion is arrived at, as Pound describes
it, through laborious technique and overtime.</p>

<p>And that technique is concentrated specifically on what?
Compression, cutting things down and eliminating words. Again, as in
Frost's "Mowing," the truth is something you get down to by cutting
away rhetorical ornament. Pound takes Japanese and Chinese poetries as
models for this aesthetics of compression. And it's worth stressing
that on the one hand Pound is polemically writing in protest against
late nineteenth-century drawing rooms that are crowded with bric-a-brac
and the ornamental aestheticism of, well, of a poet such as Swinburne
or even the early Yeats. And yet, Pound's taste for Japanese and
Chinese art comes right out of Victorian decadence and--well, you can
see this yourselves if you look at the paintings of James Whistler and
others. Pound is a polemical modernist artist who is also really, as he
looks right here, a Victorian decadent. For Pound, compression in
Japanese and Chinese poems means implication. And that's what he's
really interested in getting at.</p>

<p>In your RIS handout, you'll see his translation of Li Po's "Jewel
Stairs' Grievance," as Pound renders it. In Pound's handling, he
says:</p>

<blockquote>The jewelled steps are already quite white with dew,
[Again, this is a<br />
 dramatic monologue]<br />
 It is so late that the dew soaks my gauze stockings,<br />
 And I let down the crystal curtain<br />
 And watch the moon through the clear autumn.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>And then Pound, ever the teacher, in his poems as elsewhere, says in
his presentation of this poem:</p>

<blockquote>Note.--Jewel stairs, therefore a palace. Grievance,
therefore there is something to complain of. Gauze stockings, therefore
a court lady [is doing the complaining], not a servant who complains.
Clear autumn, therefore, he [he for whom she was waiting] has no excuse
on account of the weather. Also she has come early, for the dew has not
merely whitened the stairs, but soaks her stockings. The poem is
especially prized because she utters no direct reproach.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Here, as Pound unfolds it for us, does his explaining for us, the
human situation is inferred from the scene because it is so exactly
rendered. And the power of sentiment is felt, not through its direct
expression but rather through a kind of deliberate restraint, "The poem
is especially prized because she utters no direct reproach." Narrative
here, in this poem as in other instances of Pound's work, is displaced
by the pictorial, or you might say is not so much displaced as
condensed in it. All that matters of the story of a lover's grief can
be told in a quatrain.</p>

<p>Well, I'm going to finish in just a moment, but I want to suggest a
further dimension to this aesthetic that I'm trying to describe. In
other translations from the Chinese, Pound – who didn't know Chinese,
and I'll say a little bit more about that next time – builds a kind of
layered narrative out of discrete images and finds a way to, in a
sense, not simply create a poetry of radical compression, but rather a
poetry that expands out of this Imagistic basis. The "River Merchant's
Wife: A Letter" on page 352 is an example, and it's one of the really
great love poems of modern poetry. Like the "Jewel Stairs' Grievance,"
it is a dramatic monologue for a female speaker, but these are
different poems. By the end of this one, the wife speaks very directly,
not in reproach but in self-knowledge and pained desire.</p>

<blockquote>The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.<br />
 The paired butterflies are already yellow with August<br />
 Over the grass in the West garden;<br />
 They hurt me.<br />
 I grow older.<br />
 If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,<br />
 Please let me know beforehand,<br />
 And I will come out to meet you<br />
 As far as Cho-fu-Sa.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Of the paired yellow butterflies, the wife says with sublime
simplicity, "They hurt me. / I grow older." It's possible to forget
that the speaker who says this is sixteen, not thirty-six. But her age
makes no difference. She is already grasping – as you too will have –
through, in this case, the pain of her separation from her husband that
the essential experience of living in time is loss. With this
recognition, Pound's poem reaches out of the confines of its Imagism
toward something much larger. And at the same time, you see him
carrying forward the Imagist's "don'ts." This poem is a direct
treatment of feeling. It uses absolutely no word that does not
contribute to the presentation, and it is composed in the sequence of
the musical phrase, not that of the metronome, with those dramatically
varying line lengths. How Pound developed this poetics on a truly grand
scale, and the role that translation played in it, these are things
I'll discuss next time when we turn to the beginning of his epic poem,
<i>The Cantos.</i></p>
