<p><b>Professor Langdon Hammer</b>: Second Auden lecture. I was reading
last time from poems from the '30s, those love poems: "Lay Your
Sleeping Head, My Love," and "This Lunar Beauty." The ballad that I
read for you, "As I Walked Out One Evening," also a poem about love,
also comes from the later '30s. It is collected though in this book
called <i>Another Time</i>, a book Auden published in 1940. And I
wanted to, well, let's see, I'm afraid I've got my order all mixed up
here. I wanted to show you just the table of contents of this book
because it has a number of masterpieces in it that you are reading.</p>

<p>It's also significant that it's organized in the way that it is. The
first section is called, humbly I guess or practically, "People and
Places" and it includes in it the poem I'll be discussing shortly,
"Musée des Beaux Arts." There're another couple of sections, a section
called "Lighter Poems" that includes all kinds of song forms: "Refugee
Blues," different kinds of blues, and some kind of Gothic, satirical
ballads – "Miss Gee," "James Honeyman" – poems that are antecedents for
a song like "Maxwell's Silver Hammer." This is the kind of thing Auden
was writing. And then there's also something else called "Occasional
Poems," and in this box Auden has put "Spain 1937," that great
political poem from the Civil War, and these poems that I'll be
discussing today: "In Memory of W.B. Yeats" and "In Memory of Sigmund
Freud."</p>

<p>I wanted to call attention to this book, first of all because it
shows us these poems embedded in the actual context in which they first
appeared, but also to point out the way in which Auden has organized
his book. That is to say, he has thought of his poems as belonging to
specific categories and placed them accordingly. And they have
different genres, different forms suitable to different purposes and
occasions. And this is very much the way in which Auden imagines
himself as a poet, I think, that is, someone writing with a kind of
technical mastery with access to a whole repertoire of traditional
forms which are suitable to different purposes and different
occasions.</p>

<p>This general perspective on his work is related to the topic that I
introduced in discussing "As I Walked Out One Evening," and that is the
whole question of perspective in Auden. You remember I talked about how
that poem seems to include, well, at least three different
perspectives: that is, the quoted song of the lover who tells his
beloved that he will love her until the end of time; then, there's the
voice of the clocks who speak from the point of view of time and
correct his claims; and then finally there's a kind of narrative voice
that seems to frame the whole thing with that image of the river
running on.</p>

<p>As in that poem, Auden seems to be able to incorporate in his poetry
multiple perspectives, each of which comment on or are framed or
conditioned by the others, but each of which has its independent truth,
you could say. This is a topic that we'll explore more today looking at
other poems.</p>

<p>I wanted to show you some photographs. In the 1930s during the
Japanese-Chinese War, a prelude to the Second World War, Auden went
with his friend Christopher Isherwood to China and they created a book
together called <i>Journey to a War</i> which includes Isherwood's
prose and Auden's poetry. It's quite a remarkable book. It also
includes photographs which are presented in an interesting way. We have
here two different photographs of boys, boys who are classified here as
"soldiers" and "civilians" and then grimly are identified as "with
legs" and "without." There's a kind of interest in these photographs
and in their presentation of how--in the ways in which in war who we
are is a matter of perspective and point of view. The war gave Auden
and Isherwood an opportunity to experience what it was like to be on
the ground when planes are overhead bombing you, and here's one
photograph of that condition. And here is another illustration of this
general point I wanted to make. There are unidentified corpses under
blankets there. There are then scattered human remains and debris. And
the one photograph is identified as "The Innocent" and the other as
"The Guilty."</p>

<p>Well, the great poem on this general theme in Auden's work is "Musée
des Beaux Arts." It is a poem that Auden wrote after returning from
China in December, I believe, 1938, contemplating a return to the
United States where he had visited a short time before, contemplating,
in fact, expatriation; also, contemplating an imminent war, a world war
that would extend the horror that he had witnessed in China to all of
Europe and beyond. Suffering, in other words, was on his mind, and it's
the subject, or rather, art's relation to suffering is the subject of
this poem. The poem has as its occasion a visit to the Musée des Beaux
Art in Brussels where Auden saw among other works this painting, "The
Fall of Icarus," that is painted by Pieter Brueghel. This and other
Brueghels are referred to in the course of the poem which proceeds
almost as a kind of imaginary gallery tour or walk in which Auden as
our companion takes us to different works and contemplates their
commentary on the general issue that he is raising here: what is art's
relation to suffering?</p>

<blockquote>About suffering they were never wrong,<br />
 The Old Masters: how well they understood<br />
 Its human position [he's concerned with how you position suffering
in<br />
 human life, and he's taking Brueghel as a model]; how it takes
place<br />
 While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking
dully<br />
 along [as this line of poetry itself seems to];<br />
 How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting<br />
 For the miraculous birth [now he's contemplating a Nativity scene],
there<br />
 must always be<br />
 Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating<br />
 On a pond at the edge of the wood:<br />
 They never forgot [the old masters]<br />
 That even the dreadful martyrdom [and now he's looking at
Brueghel's<br />
 painting "The Massacre of the Innocents"] must run its course<br />
 Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot<br />
 Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse
[no<br />
 more innocent or guilty than those boys, I suppose]<br />
 Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>The Old Masters know the human position of suffering, its position
in human life. "Position" is important; it's an important word for
Auden here. He's concerned with how experience is placed. Sometimes he
calls this geography. It is a topos, a motif, and an idea in his poetry
that Elizabeth Bishop will take over quite directly from him and
develop and make central to her poetry. The idea is that things have
meaning in relation to, in their connection with, but also their
separation from each other. Suffering is part, but only a part and not
the center of human life, a repertoire of actions and conditions and
states of being that is much larger. In Brueghel, in his "Massacre of
the Innocents" – I won't try to find it now among my slides for
you--Auden focuses on the "torturer's horse," the animal that is part
of the scene and that motivated by an itch, scratches its behind while
the dreadful martyrdom runs its course.</p>

<p>In this poem, as in other Auden poems, note the prose rhythms. The
poem does seem to at times walk dully along. Auden, like Moore, is
writing in an expository manner, I guess an essayistic manner. This is
part of the tone of the poem. Auden is getting into his poetry a kind
of neo-classical, eighteenth-century aesthetic, an ability to talk
about ideas in poetry in, again, a discursive, expository manner that
includes humor and that is matter-of-fact, is observant. Pain, like the
tears that I talked about last time that had dried on Auden's pages,
pain is part of the picture, but it is just a part. It's, in a sense,
been put aside.</p>

<p>All of this is a function of what I'm calling Auden's perspectivism.
Any scene borders on other scenes where other people are positioned
looking at the same thing differently or not looking at it at all. And
this is one of the themes of the second section of the poem where Auden
specifically describes this painting. He says:</p>

<blockquote>In Brueghel's <i>Icarus</i>, for instance….</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And this is a poetry in which the poet says "for instance," just as
Moore might have said "however."</p>

<blockquote>how everything turns away<br />
 Quite leisurely from the disaster….</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And he's talking about the shepherd who's looking up to the sky,
he's talking about the ploughman who has his back turned to the fall;
and where is it? It's hard probably for you to see, but it's hard to
find in any case because this dramatic event that is the center of
Brueghel's pictures – in fact, these bare legs disappearing into the
sea as the overreaching son of Daedalus plunges into the water – is not
at all in the center of the picture.</p>

<blockquote>how everything turns away [Auden observes]<br />
 Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may<br />
 Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,<br />
 But for him it was not an important failure.…</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>He's not concerned with flying to or beyond the sun. For him the sun
merely shines, it helps him cultivate the land.</p>

<blockquote>the sun shone [of necessity]<br />
 As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green<br />
 Water [the white legs disappearing into the green water]; and
the<br />
 expensive delicate ship that must have seen<br />
 Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,<br />
 Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Well, here Auden wasn't thinking about Hart Crane, but he might have
been. It's almost as if this figure has leaped off the back of the
boat, as Crane did. He is, however, thinking, I suppose, about
romanticism in general and its ambitions. Here, the sun shines as it
had to. What it illuminates are white legs. There's a kind of
objectivity in that, there's a kind of naturalism. It shines on green
water. It's as if from a certain perspective, from the perspective of
aesthetic form, these elements of the picture are merely elements of
the picture – colors, which have meaning as they are placed in a system
of relationships and a system of perspectives.</p>

<p>Well, there's a great deal more to be said about this painting. I
think one idea that is worth emphasizing is the way in which the
ploughman, in Auden's account as in Brueghel's painting, has
prominence, has a greater prominence than the heroic, romantic figure
plunging into the sea. The ploughman is going about his ordinary daily
work, and as he turns these furrows, we are reminded, as Auden surely
was reminded, of the ancient classical connection between verse –
meaning the turning, in Latin, from one line to another – and the
shaping action of the plough that creates these furrows in the earth,
committing the poet, as he identifies with the ploughman, to a kind of
poetry of craft and of the earth that involves, in a sense, turning
away from disaster.</p>

<p>Well, this poem was written in Europe. It is a poem that Auden – let
me find this picture here – with which Auden, in a sense, turns his
back on Europe and, for the moment at least, the imminent world war. He
comes to the United States; he immigrates to the United States in
January 1939. This personal turning point in a poetic career comes at a
moment when the world is about to be split in war. It also comes at a
significant moment in literary history when Yeats dies, and Auden
recognizes this occasion as a moment to celebrate the poet, contemplate
the achievement in modern poetry that he represents Yeats and, in a
sense, provide a kind of epitaph for a poetry now in the past and
behind us that positions Auden in the present.</p>

<p>Let's look at the view of Yeats and of Yeats's poetry that emerges
here. The poem extends the questions of "Musée des Beaux Arts" by
asking not so much what is art's relation to suffering as what is the
place of art in society generally, or poetry in particular? Auden
begins:</p>

<blockquote>He disappeared in the dead of winter:<br />
 The brooks were frozen, the air-ports almost deserted,<br />
 And snow disfigured the public statues;<br />
 The mercury sank in the mouth of the dying day.<br />
 Oh, all the instruments agree<br />
 The day of his death was a dark cold day.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>There's a sense, as Auden elaborates these ideas, that natural
science is here mocking the pathetic fallacy that all nature should
mourn when the poet dies and reflect the grief of this event. He's
saying, Auden is, it was a cold day and we had instruments to measure
it and that that's what it was, in a kind of factual way. He continues,
Auden does:</p>

<blockquote>Now he [Yeats] is scattered among a hundred cities<br />
 And wholly given over to unfamiliar affections….<br />
 …<br />
 The words of a dead man<br />
 Are modified in the guts of the living.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Yeats is passed on to us. And yet to whom has he passed on? What
difference does he make? Auden doesn't want us to make the mistake of
thinking that Yeats is too central a figure, that he matters too
much.</p>

<blockquote>But in the importance and noise of to-morrow [he
continues]<br />
 When the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of the
Bourse,<br />
 And the poor have the sufferings to which they are fairly
accustomed,<br />
 And each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of his
freedom;<br />
 A few thousand will think of this day<br />
 As one thinks of a day when one did something slightly
unusual.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>This is an attempt to, in some sense, place poetry realistically in
culture. It doesn't matter to the brokers "roaring like beasts on the
floor of the Bourse." It doesn't matter to the poor who have their
suffering "to which they are fairly accustomed." It matters, well,
perhaps to "a few thousand" people, not a negligible number but not a
large one either. There's a kind of modesty in Auden's claims for
Yeats, for poetry. You could contrast Pound at the same time as this
poem is being written, broadcasting his ideas on Fascist radio, or you
could think about Stevens at the same time dreaming up a poem he will
call "Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction." This is a rather different claim
for what poetry might do. It returns to a theme of <i>The Waste
Land</i>. Somehow, the world that Auden is describing is one in which
we are each imprisoned in the cell of ourselves, recalling the locked
chambers of Eliot's poem.</p>

<p>In the second section, Auden moves to address Yeats directly. Now
Yeats has, in a sense, claimed for us his difference, the vatic powers
of language, the visionary ambition, and the occult learning. All of
that that would distinguish and separate him from us is put aside, and
what he shares with us is emphasized:</p>

<blockquote>You were silly like us [silly]: your gift survived it all;
[it had to survive a lot,<br />
 it had to survive]<br />
 The parish of rich women, [who doted on him, his own] physical
decay,<br />
 Yourself [himself; Auden says]; mad Ireland hurt you into
poetry.<br />
 Now Ireland has her madness and her weather still [you did not affect
it,<br />
 you did not affect it because you are a man and only a man. In
fact],<br />
 For poetry makes nothing happen.…</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>This is one of the most quoted sentences in modern poetry: "poetry
makes nothing happen." It is almost always quoted, however, out of
context. It is part of a long sentence. It comes first as a
qualification on what Yeats, on the difference Yeats has made in the
world. Auden's saying in a sense, no, you haven't made a difference,
for poetry makes nothing happen. But the poem continues then, the
sentence continues. Auden says, (colon): "it survives." "…Poetry makes
nothing happen: it survives." Where? It survives:</p>

<blockquote>In the valley of its saying where executives<br />
 Would never want to tamper, it flows south<br />
 From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs,<br />
 Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,<br />
 A way of happening, a mouth.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Poetry doesn't make things happen. It has a different kind of
action. It survives; it lasts. How does it last, where does it last? It
lasts "in the valley of its saying," a kind of imaginary landscape or a
kind of world that is created through speech here. "The valley of its
saying": perhaps a rich place to live but also a space that evokes a
kind of absence or hollow, right? Or a kind of opening perhaps, or a
gap. As Auden develops this idea the poetry becomes what he calls "a
way of happening, a mouth." And then that valley is refigured as a
mouth – an open mouth, I'm sure, a mouth open where words are coming
out, where more words will follow and flow like a kind of river.</p>

<p>Poetry, in that sense, doesn't make anything happen. It is rather a
way of happening, that is, a kind of method or model, a path or
discipline: a way. Not a deed, but something more like the symbol of a
deed or the figure of a kind of potential action, a nothing that is
somehow something, too, again, I think, an image implying an open
mouth; that is, the mouth of a river or the mouth of a poet, through
which language flows.</p>

<p>Then the poem moves into, I think, a kind of illustration of the
kind of action that poetry engages in, and that comes with the movement
into these ceremonial quatrains in iambic tetrameter, essentially. Is
that what it is? Well, it's definitely a tetrameter. The rhyme enters.
The prose rhythms of the poem up to now give way to a kind of
ceremonial lyric language. Here poetry is identified with praise and
with prayer. The poem gives us a kind of performative language of human
ceremony that honors Yeats, that lays him to rest and yet also absorbs
and affirms the power of poetry that was in him.</p>

<blockquote>Earth, receive an honoured guest;<br />
 William Yeats is laid to rest.<br />
 Let the Irish vessel lie<br />
 Emptied of its poetry.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Auden goes on to describe the way that time will honor poetry and
will honor Yeats; that time will even, he says – Auden does – forgive
Yeats for the right-wing politics that Yeats's later career is marked
by and that Auden separates himself from and needs to come to terms
with in this poem. He says:</p>

<blockquote>Time with this strange excuse<br />
 Pardoned Kipling and his views,<br />
 And will pardon Paul Claudel [Kipling, for his imperial jingoism,
Claudel<br />
 for his proto-Fascist ideas],<br />
 Pardons him [Yeats also] for writing well.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Auden, looking back on this poem, would ask himself, how could I
possibly presume to judge Yeats and forgive him morally for his
politics? And he struck these condescending lines from his poem. So,
you won't find them in <i>The Collected Poems</i> but you will find the
powerful lines that proceed from them.</p>

<blockquote>In the nightmare of the dark<br />
 All the dogs of Europe bark,<br />
 And the living nations wait,<br />
 Each sequestered in its hate;<br />
<br />
Intellectual disgrace<br />
 Stares from every human face,<br />
 And the seas of pity lie<br />
 Locked and frozen in each eye.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>What does the poet do in this condition?</p>

<blockquote>Follow, poet, follow right<br />
 To the bottom of the night….</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>The poet descends and descends into night, a night that is this
nightmare in which Europe barks, ready to attack itself.</p>

<blockquote>With your unconstraining voice<br />
 Still persuade us to rejoice;<br />
<br />
With the farming of a verse [and remember the ploughman now, as a<br />
 figure for the poet]<br />
 Make a vineyard of the curse,<br />
 Sing of human unsuccess<br />
 In a rapture of distress;<br />
<br />
In the deserts of the heart<br />
 Let the healing fountains start,<br />
 In the prison of his days<br />
 Teach the free man how to praise.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>This is what poetry can offer. It can offer a lesson in how to
praise. This is not making something happen politically in the world,
perhaps, but it's making something happen in the heart and perhaps
within the eye of each of us who look locked and staring with our pity,
frozen there. Poetry would be a kind of farming in the desert of the
heart that would break open that which is locked there and free
feeling. It's a powerful and very traditional claim for what poems can
do. And in talking about <i>The Waste Land</i>, I stressed the ways in
which Eliot sought language of public ritual that might join people
separated in the cells of themselves. Here, Auden is working through
the same ideas and providing a kind of model for how that might
work.</p>

<p>Let me turn ahead with you to another great poem from this period,
"In Memory of Sigmund Freud." Freud is a kind of ploughman. He is
another model for the poet, for Auden. And this poem proposes still
other ways to understand poetry's relation to suffering, represented
here by Freud's humanistic, therapeutic technique. What sort of hero is
Freud? Auden calls him "an important Jew who died in exile." It's
significant that he is called that by Auden at this moment. If you look
for the figure of the Jew in "Gerontion," Eliot's early poem, you'll
see that the figure is not dignified with a capital <i>J</i>.
Anti-Semitism is a crisis in Europe and it's certainly a pervasive
current in modern poetry. Whether it is actually a theme or a motif, as
it appears in Eliot or Pound, or simply a kind of voluble prejudice as
you would find it in Williams's letters, anti-Semitism is powerful. And
here, Auden is identifying himself with Freud as a Jew and as a Jew in
exile. And it seems as though Freud in this way represents a figure for
people who are in some sense extracted from the nation and who are
international in their perspective. And Auden himself is writing in
America from a similar point of view.</p>

<p>As in the Yeats elegy, Auden is reluctant to single Freud out when,
as he says, death is so common and suffering is so common. But Freud's
point of view for Auden is powerful and valuable precisely because it
emphasizes the commonplaceness of human suffering, its ubiquity. He's
praised – Freud is – as the poem unfolds, specifically for the ways in
which he responds to suffering. How does he do it? Well, around line 28
or so, on page 804, Auden says:</p>

<blockquote>All that he did was to remember<br />
 Like the old and be honest like children.<br />
<br />
He wasn't clever at all [he was silly like us]: he merely told<br />
 The unhappy Present to recite the Past<br />
 Like a poetry lesson till sooner<br />
 Or later it faltered at the line where<br />
<br />
Long ago the accusations had begun,<br />
 And suddenly knew by whom it had been judged,<br />
 How rich life had been and how silly [there's that word again],<br />
 And was life-forgiven and more humble,<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
No wonder the ancient cultures of conceit<br />
 In his technique of unsettlement [that's what he (Auden) calls
Freud's<br />
 therapeutic technique, the talking cure: it's a technique of
unsettlement]<br />
 foresaw<br />
 The fall of princes, the collapse of<br />
 Their lucrative patterns of frustration.<br />
<br />
If he had succeeded [Freud], why, the Generalised Life<br />
 Would become impossible, the monolith<br />
 Of State be broken and prevented<br />
 The co-operation of avengers.<br />
<br />
Of course they called on God [his (Freud's) detractors]: but he went
his<br />
 way [like the poet who follows right to the bottom of the
night],<br />
 Down among the Lost People like Dante, down<br />
 To the stinking fosse where the injured<br />
<br />
 Lead the ugly life of the rejected.<br />
<br />
And showed us what evil is: not as we thought<br />
 Deeds that must be punished, but our lack of faith,<br />
 Our dishonest mood of denial,<br />
 The concupiscence of the oppressor.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Auden emphasizes Freud's literary dimensions. The talking cure is
like a poetry lesson. It puts faith in speech, in the powers of true
speech, to correct and reshape and heal human life. It is a technique
of unsettlement that is a threat to princes, all worldly authority,
because it questions authority and empowers the individual speaker to
take life into his hands. Like Dante or like Pound's Ulysses in
<i>Canto I</i>, like the poet at the end of the Yeats elegy, Freud, in
Auden's poem, goes down among the lost people and goes into "the
stinking fosse," which is a powerful word. It's a word that appears in
<i>Canto I</i> where Ulysses, Pound's Ulysses, goes to seek Tiresias.
"Fosse," it's an Anglo-Saxon word. It reaches back, in that sense, in
cultural history to suggest that our present misery is one with,
continuous with, that of the past.</p>

<p>And yet history is something here that can be intervened in, in an
individual way through the kind of true speech that Auden celebrates in
Freud and that he aspires to in poetry. As the elegy builds towards its
conclusion, on page 806, again the night appears. Freud:</p>

<blockquote>… would have us remember most of all<br />
 To be enthusiastic over the night [and its lost people,
ourselves]<br />
 Not only for the sense of wonder<br />
 It alone has to offer [night, the unconscious], but also<br />
 Because it needs our love: for with sad eyes<br />
 Its delectable creatures look up and beg<br />
 Us dumbly to ask them to follow….</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>That is, all the properties here of the unconscious that are
identified at the same time with all those who are lost in society and
need to be represented and claimed. They are, like Freud:</p>

<blockquote>…exiles who long for the future<br />
 That lies in our power. [Again a power of speech.] They too would
rejoice<br />
 If allowed to serve enlightenment like him [like Freud],<br />
 Even to bear our cry of "Judas,"<br />
As he did and all must bear who serve it.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Freud here is in exile, and he brings insight but he also brings
love. Auden is imagining a kind of general state of homelessness, which
Freud's technique of unsettlement isn't meant to redress but rather to
recognize and accept and help us adjust to and live in. Auden's own
technique here is--well, his verse form is a simple syllable count: 11
syllables, 11 syllables, 9 syllables, 10. The normative ten-syllable
line comes last and fourth and gives a kind of resolution to each
quatrain. This simple pattern, again, accommodates and promotes a kind
of prose speech, a kind of ordinariness that identifies Freud's work
and the poet's work with a kind of ordinary, ongoing work and that
accommodates rationality in a rational voice, as Auden will describe
Freud's as being, and yet also accommodates feeling at the same time
and accommodates love.</p>

<blockquote>One rational voice is dumb [Freud's, he's silent]: over a
grave [his grave]<br />
 The household of Impulse mourns one dearly loved [because he<br />
 understood how to love our impulses].<br />
 Sad is Eros, builder of cities,<br />
 And weeping anarchic Aphrodite.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It's eventually a powerful, moving conclusion. Eros and Aphrodite
have lost their champion.</p>

<p>I'm going to conclude by commenting very quickly, since we're almost
out of time, on one last poem, arguably Auden's greatest, "In Praise of
Limestone," a poem written from the perspective of the post-war in the
United States, but about a kind of imaginary landscape that combines
elements of his childhood – a landscape in northern England – and the
Italian landscape where he returned in the post-War period and became
increasingly attached to. It is a kind of allegorical space and it
represents a home, I suppose, for the homeless, for we, "the inconstant
ones," as he describes us. It is, this limestone landscape, something
to be praised, and it is a poem of praise.</p>

<p>It is an image of the world without another transcendental world
beyond or behind it. To be in the world, as described in this poem, is
to be in an entirely earthly realm. And again, you might think of the
ploughman turning away from the over-reacher who tried to fly to the
sky and turns rather to the earth. It is a landscape like that of
Stevens in "Sunday Morning." It is a landscape that Auden can only
describe as a kind of imaginary place through counter-factual
statements. It is porous. It's rich, it's fertile, and it's moderate.
It is not a place of extremes; and hermits and Caesars; they don't
belong here. They go elsewhere. It's rather a place in which ordinary
life and ordinary people might live.</p>

<p>The very end of the poem is extremely powerful because it looks
towards a kind of redeemed human life, sees it in this landscape, and
yet represents it in the conditional. Auden says--this is on page
808:</p>

<blockquote>In so far as we have to look forward<br />
 To death as a fact [something he will never let us forget], no doubt
we<br />
 are right: But if<br />
 Sins can be forgiven, if bodies rise from the dead [and you note
the<br />
 conditional in both phrases],<br />
 These modifications of matter into<br />
 Innocent athletes [the people that he peoples this landscape with]
and<br />
 gesticulating fountains,<br />
 Made solely for pleasure, make a further point:<br />
 The blessed will not care what angle they are regarded from,<br />
 Having nothing to hide. Dear [and now he speaks to a beloved], I
know<br />
 nothing of<br />
 Either [that is, what it would mean to be blessed or to have nothing
to<br />
 hide: I know nothing of either of those things], but when I try to
imagine a<br />
 faultless love<br />
 Or the life to come, what I hear is the murmur<br />
 Of underground streams, what I see is a limestone
landscape.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>A landscape that is Auden's version of an earthly paradise and our
only image of these ultimate promises. Auden manages somehow here to
make us see and feel what the life to come might be like, what it might
be like to be blessed, while still acknowledging that we can only live
in and be in and speak in the world before us, which is the one that
Auden remains, throughout his poetry, dedicated to.</p>

<p>Well, we'll go on to a poet closely identified with Auden, Elizabeth
Bishop, on Wednesday.</p>
