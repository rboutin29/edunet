<p><b>Professor Langdon Hammer</b>: I'm going to talk about William
Carlos Williams today. It may be that I end up carrying a little bit of
Williams over to next time--to Marianne Moore, his friend,
contemporary, and really close collaborator, in a sense, in the New
York scene of modernism in the teens, twenties, thirties, forties, and
on into the fifties.</p>

<p>This is the man, as a young man, William Carlos Williams. If you
open your anthologies to page 284, in the long and useful head-note
that Jahan Ramazani provides you, there's this quotation from a letter
in the middle of page 284 that Williams wrote to Harriet Monroe, the
editor of <i>Poetry</i> whom thirteen years later Hart Crane would
write to in defense of his poem, "At Melville's Tomb." And Williams
says in this letter to Monroe:</p>

<blockquote>Most current verse is dead from the point of view of art…
[It's dead, it's lifeless; and what Williams cares about is something
he calls "life."] Now life is above all things else at any moment
subversive of life as it was the moment before [and I think that's how
we know it in Williams's life: whatever is subverting whatever was a
moment before. And subversive is probably an important and suggestive
word there]--always new, irregular. [He wants what is new, and what is
new is going to be what is irregular, and what is irregular has in some
sense subverted what was in place before. He continues.] Verse to be
alive [to have what Pound, I think, would have called "the impulse"]
must have infused into it something of the same order [it has to have
life in it, or what he calls] some tincture of disestablishment,
something in the nature of an impalpable revolution, an ethereal
reversal, let me say. I am speaking of modern verse.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Like certain of our other poets, Williams is self-consciously
modern. He's defining what "modern" means, and he's defining it as a
quality of experience that he calls "life," that has the quality of
disrupting whatever was in existence before. And this is a quality and
energy that he wants to have in his poetry itself. This is Williams a
little bit older, Williams in 1924, when he has established himself
through the poems in a volume called <i>Spring and All</i>, as one of
the major modern poets in America.</p>

<p>He is the author of a poem – have you ever seen it? – called "The
Red Wheelbarrow." And that might be a good place to begin. That's on
pages 294 to 295. Of course, I'm joking. Probably that's the one poem
everybody in this class has read before they came to this class. It is
better known than "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" or "Stopping by Woods on
a Snowy Evening," even. It is also distinguished, I think, as being the
second shortest modern poem after "In a Station of the Metro," a poem
that it's related to in certain ways.</p>

<p>In fact, a link between Williams and Pound is important, it's
relevant. Pound was a friend and rival for Williams throughout his
career. Williams is sometimes seen in his early stages as a kind of
Imagist or at any rate as a poet influenced by the Imagist aesthetic.
Imagism is, of course, a visual metaphor, and Williams is above all a
visual poet, a poet of the eye.</p>

<blockquote>so much depends<br />
 upon<br />
<br />
a red wheel<br />
 barrow<br />
<br />
glazed with rain<br />
 water<br />
<br />
beside the white<br />
 chickens.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Well, I think you have to see that poem to start to really be able
to read it. It, I think, probably does involve some subtle vocal and
auditory experience, but it's first of all a poem that meets you and
challenges you through the eye, as a visual object in some sense on the
page. The kind of seeing that Williams's poems call for is--we can
think of it as a way of reading that his poems themselves demand. In
other words, there's a kind of link between how he sees the world and
the way in which he asks us to read him. His poems model a kind of
seeing.</p>

<p>Unlike "In a Station of the Metro," "The Red Wheelbarrow," or let me
call it instead "So Much Depends," is a poem without a title. This
title, "The Red Wheelbarrow," was like the title "This is Just to Say"
in the poem that follows, the almost equally famous poem. These are
titles Williams added later to his work. In <i>Spring and All</i>--that
volume, the first edition, 1923 – the poem appears simply as a text on
the page. And that's important. It's part of--it's as important as the
title is for "In a Station of the Metro." Simply presenting the poem on
the page to us, as Williams does, doing without a title, Williams asks
us to, in some sense, read and encounter this poem without a frame,
without some kind of pre-established boundary or explanatory
introduction or entry. That choice increases the immediacy of our
experience. It's as if Williams were asking you to kind of press up
close to the poem, face it, just as he is facing the thing he is
writing about; or asks us to face not the thing that he's writing about
so much as his act of writing and seeing, his act of writing as it
embodies a way of seeing. The poem has a suggestion that it requires as
a poem the same kind of calm intensity of concentration that the poet's
observation of the wheelbarrow exemplifies. So again, I think the kind
of seeing that the poem does models a way of reading.</p>

<p>Well, what is that way of reading? How does the poem embody in its
construction – which it calls attention to – how does it embody in its
construction a mode of perception, a way of seeing? How has Williams
organized this language on the page, by what principles? Looking at it,
well, as I suggested before, it's not a poem, I think, that we begin by
hearing, and we have to start reading it and seeing it before we can
even think about how to really speak it properly. It is not a metrical
poem. This is not iambic pentameter. It is a free verse poem.</p>

<p>In the prologue to <i>Kora In Hell</i>, which is the prose I asked
you to read for today at the back of the book, there are a number of
sentences and ideas that are important. I'll call attention to just a
few. On page 958, Williams says, "Nothing is good save the new. If a
thing have novelty, it stands intrinsically beside every other work of
artistic excellence. If it have not that, no loveliness or heroic
proportion or grand manner will save it." And he identifies here, as
elsewhere, this property of novelty with a kind of verse that eschews
rhyme and meter, a whole host of existing poetic conventions. Again, in
the head note to the Williams selection, there's a quotation from
Williams on the subject of meter on page 285 from his prose statement,
"The Poem as a Field of Action." He says:</p>

<blockquote>I propose sweeping changes from top to bottom of the poetic
structure…. I say we are through with the iambic pentameter as
presently conceived, at least for dramatic verse; through with the
measured quatrain, the staid concatenation of sounds in the usual
stanza, the sonnet.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So much for "The Silken Tent," Hart Crane, Wallace Stevens, et
cetera. Williams is insisting that modern verse, the kind of verse he
describes, has to break with these models and has to proceed by
patterns that it itself invents. Free verse is in that sense Williams's
chosen medium; free verse meaning a poem not patterned by metrical
scheme or rhyme, or indeed some other, in a sense, pre-existing
principle or pattern. Nonetheless, free verse does always have some
kind of operative pattern, sometimes very strict and structuring ones,
and this short poem is a good example.</p>

<p>In fact, as you examine it, you see a series of four stanzas, four
two-line groups – since Williams might not like the word "stanza" –
four two-line groups. And the pattern is long-short, three or four
syllables followed by two. And this is itself almost like a metrical or
rhyme scheme. In fact, you could say this poem is more strict than a
sonnet, that it's more limited in the range of choices that it allows.
It isn't, however, presented to us as sonnets are, as an instance of a
received verse form that is at least in its general pattern invariant
and again pre-existing. Instead, the poem presents itself as a kind of
ad-hoc arrangement, as a kind of structure that the poet has chosen to
work within, reflecting the contingencies of this moment, the occasion,
the poem's purpose.</p>

<p>The poem's shape – and this is one reason it's hard to speak, it's
hard to hear – organizes Williams's speech in a manner that disregards
or disrupts normal familiar syntax. It does so specifically through
enjambment, by carrying one line over to the next. Williams's
enjambments have here, as throughout his poetry, the effect of breaking
up language: breaking it up; forcing us to, in fact, slow down our
reading; to stop taking language's sense-making for granted; and, in a
sense, to get into the poem. The white space in a Williams's poem
is--you can think of it as a space for thought, a space where we are
invited, allowed, required to think about choices, to ask ourselves
about what possible connections can be made at a given moment.</p>

<p>In this poem Williams specifically breaks words up into their
component parts – wheel, barrow, rain, water – without hyphens, as if
what he was looking at – a red wheelbarrow – consisted of those three
terms: redness, the wheel, the barrow. These are its component
elements. He points out, in effect, in this device, how in this case
two nouns that are made of compounds – they're really compounds –
represent things that are compounds, things that are made up of other
things that have parts.</p>

<p>As he establishes this pattern, "so much depends / upon / a red
wheel / barrow / glazed with rain / water," you want to carry it
forward, don't you – now that we've learned what he's doing – into the
next stanza, 'beside the white / chickens," as if "white chickens" were
the same kind of compound as "rainwater" and "red wheelbarrow." But
they're not quite, and Williams is, in a way, teasing us. White
chickens aren't made up of "white"-ness and "chicken"-ness in the same
way that a wheelbarrow is made up of a "wheel" and a "barrow." He's
doing something a little different here. No sooner has he, in effect,
established a certain pattern of cognition – showed us how to read his
enjambments – than he breaks that pattern. He revises how it works.
It's just been put in place and now it's changed and in fact it's over,
it's done. The poem is done.</p>

<p>If the first lines of the poem and the first stanzas are, in a
sense, made to interrupt and disrupt and thereby freshen our habits of
seeing, to make us see these things in some new way, this last stanza
does away with the habit of seeing that the poem itself has just
constructed, just introduced us to. Williams prevents us from settling
into a convention of perception, even in a poem that is as small and as
brief as this one. There's really only enough time in the poem's
essentially introduction and three parts following to establish a
pattern and break it.</p>

<p>What this brief moment of heightened perception allows us to see, to
experience, is something small and large. What is it that depends on
the red wheelbarrow? Williams only says "so much," "so much." The idea
is, I think, the beautiful one that the world, when it's glazed with
rain water--it's a kind of aesthetic effect, an aesthetic effect that
implies a light that does the glazing, that's somewhere behind our
shoulders and the poet's, as he looks at these objects, this light,
which comes after rain and is a product of change, of the energy of the
world as it transforms; suddenly allows this world to be seen in
visible detail, apprehensible in its component parts; and the ordinary
<i>gestalt</i> of perception is interrupted, freshened and re-oriented.
We see something, something ordinary, newly and freshly. It stands out.
And what we see in miniature in the limited space of the moment, or of
the poem, is a world, well, what we see is the elements out of which
the world is made, elements ordinarily held in a kind of complex mutual
dependency: a kind of complex of relations that we simply take for
granted in the words that we use and in the way that we see things,
just as we put together "wheel" and "barrow" and "rain" and "water,"
without thinking about it. What the red wheelbarrow holds, then, and
what in that sense depends on it is something pretty heavy, and that is
the sense of a whole world; or better, the sense of the world in its
wholeness, which is something affirmed in this attractively modest,
momentary, poetic perception.</p>

<p>So much for "The Red Wheelbarrow." <i>Spring and All</i>: and
there's that idea again, in the title, spring as a season of newness:
for Williams, beginning his career, spring registering his own
beginnings, registering modernness, a vision of the world in its
newness. Well, <i>Spring and All</i> is a beautiful book, and one I
wish I could show you, but the last time I saw it at the Beinecke it
disappeared and no one has seen it in a couple of years. They have a
lot of paper over there. I guess it's easy to lose things. Maybe it's
available again, we'll look and see. It's a beautiful, plain book,
robin's egg blue for spring, I suppose. It seems--it's not large; it's
small. It almost has no ornament. In all of this, it seems to exemplify
the American virtues of plainness and directness and simplicity; again,
a long way from Hart Crane. And the book is really so American that it
was published in Dijon. Williams is a polemically American poet, even
more than Crane in certain ways, more than Frost even, and yet Williams
has a very important and vital relationship to European modernism and
to French modernism in particular, and more particularly to French
painting. And to understand how Williams is writing, what he's trying
to get at, it's helpful to remember what he was looking at.</p>

<p>Here's a Braque, Georges Braque, 1908. It's on the way to cubism
and, I think, sort of helpfully on the way to cubism because it looks
back to a realist tradition with its, in a sense, conventional,
perspectival space that's yet being broken up into planes, that allow
us to register the painting as a painting, that force us to, really.
And I suppose even more striking is this: one of many great late
Cezanne paintings of Le Mont Sainte-Victoire where here, again, the
perspectival space of the painting is being turned into almost a kind
of abstract field of color patterns. Again, these are painters
interested in foregrounding their action of seeing through the ways in
which they foreground self-consciously the materiality of the medium in
which they are working.</p>

<p>The aim in postimpressionist painting, and then in cubism, really,
is to again break up that <i>gestalt</i> of perception that Williams is
also opposing himself to: to break it up and grasp, in some sense, the
dynamism in the world before us, precisely through acts of seeing that
call attention to themselves and to the way in which that seeing is
rendered. If you have read the prologue to <i>Kora in Hell</i>, which
starts on page 954, you know that Williams begins with an anecdote
about Marcel Duchamp, part of the New York art world that Williams also
participated in through his friend, the dealer and taste maker Walter
Arensberg: "Once when I was taking lunch with Walter Arensberg… I asked
him if he could state what the more modern painters were about…" And
then he gives several as examples, including Duchamp, all of whom were
then in New York, and:</p>

<blockquote>[Arensberg] replied by saying that the only way man
differed from every other creature was in his ability to improvise
novelty and, since the pictorial artist was under discussion, anything
in paint that is truly new, truly a fresh creation is good art. Thus,
according to Duchamp, who was Arensberg's champion at the time, a
stained glassed window that had fallen out and lay more or less
together on the ground was a far greater interest than the thing
conventionally composed <i>in situ</i>.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Which is an interesting model for what Williams himself might be
seen as doing in poetry, that in some sense he's taking the stained
glass window and seeing it laid out on the floor, maybe broken on the
floor. Duchamp painted this famous work, <i>Nude Descending a
Staircase</i>, and it is clearly all about here rendering in pictorial
form the kind of multiframe vision that photography and motion pictures
allow us to see, to again here grasp in representation some sense of
the movement and energy that compose the world that we see before
us.</p>

<p>The other dimension of the Duchamp anecdote that's nice, and about
Williams is telling, is that a stained glass window that has fallen out
is something you come upon or find. And Duchamp is, of course, most
famous for his – let me turn to the next image – his ready-mades. This
a facsimile of the--or that is another version of his most famous
ready-made fountain, a urinal, which he signed with the pseudonym, R.
Mutt 1917, and presented as a work of art. The Art Gallery has this
work. This too is, as it were, a facsimile of the original, now lost: a
snow shovel, another ready-made; this one with the excellent title,
<i>In Advance of the Broken Arm</i>. Duchamp takes postimpressionism to
New York in the form of dada – a movement with its importance for
Williams, too, including, I think, Duchamp's mischievousness and his
willingness to provoke the subversive – to take Williams's word – and
to play with expectations about what constitutes art, as Williams in
certain ways would play with our expectations about what could
constitute a poem or poetic statement.</p>

<p>In New York and elsewhere, Williams is in contact with a whole range
of modernist American artists influenced by the European art I've just
been talking about, but also working in a distinctively American mode.
This is a work by Charles Demuth, 1921. I'm sorry, I'm behind on
producing my image lists but I'll get those for you. And here's
another. And again here: an urban scene, that is realist in its mode of
representation, and yet the foregrounding of the lines created by the
different shapes of the buildings call attention to this as indeed a
kind of constructed image that seems to be moving out of the realm of
realist representation to something more symbolic and certainly
avowedly created by the artist. Demuth goes further in the same
direction in what is probably his best known work. This is called
<i>The Great Figure Number 5</i>. If Williams was busy looking at these
artists I've just been talking about, they also were looking at him,
and Demuth's painting is a tribute to Williams and a little homage;
also, I think, a little joke about Williams's own poem, also from
<i>Spring and All</i>, that we know as "The Great Figure" on page 291.
Well, I'll read this; again, rain and light:</p>

<blockquote>Among the rain<br />
 and lights<br />
 I saw the figure 5<br />
 in gold<br />
 on a red<br />
 firetruck<br />
 moving<br />
 with weight and urgency<br />
 tense<br />
 unheeded<br />
 to gong clangs<br />
 siren howls<br />
 and wheels rumbling<br />
 through the dark city.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And this is Demuth's rendering of that moment that draws out the way
in which the poem finds and makes an exalted symbol from this ordinary
perception, and it's got "Bill" up top, and "W.C.W." down in the
bottom, and "Carlos" underneath the 5, as part of this friendly
tribute.</p>

<p>The poem's interesting to look at next to "The Red Wheelbarrow."
Here's something else that's red, right? And again, the poem is
concerned with a moment of perception. Here, the poem really tries to
render the process by which perception takes place, or rather the kind
of context in which it does, which "The Red Wheelbarrow" doesn't. "The
Red Wheelbarrow" really kind of takes something seen, almost
fragmented, out of a continuum of perception that we can feel implied
but isn't made explicit in the poem. In this case, we are given the
kind of context out of which a detail, something arbitrary, contingent,
and ordinary, springs out; springs out of the rush of things and
catches the eye and the imagination and the intention of the poet. "In
a Station of the Metro" is a poem about metropolitan, urban perception.
So, is this poem. Here, instead of a present moment that's briefly
suspended, as in Pound's poem or as in "So Much Depends," this poem is
just as much about memory in the rush of ongoing experience, of a kind
of ongoing temporality figured here by the firetruck "moving" – and
there's that participial word, "moving" – a kind of ongoing action.</p>

<p>In the midst of this, something catches the poet's attention. He
acts as a perceiver. He says "I saw" in that action, expressed in a
verb in the past tense; intervenes in and cuts into this blurry,
perceptual, participial flow of things that is the fire truck rushing
by. It fixes on a figure, in this case a number, and carries that away
and out of the experience. That "5" on the fire truck, it's something
utterly ordinary like a wheelbarrow or a shovel, a snow shovel, and
it's a kind of found object. And yet here for Williams--he makes
something of it, or plays with the act of making something with it. It
is something he calls, with some joking, some seriousness, "the great
figure": a great figure, a symbol. But a symbol of what exactly? Well,
perhaps a symbol of the very capacity of the ordinary to arrest our
attention and become significant, become objects of perception; perhaps
a symbol of the five senses themselves. What do you think? That seems
possible, too. The five senses whose powers are behind, for Williams,
the way we create figurative language, the way we create figures and
poems and discover symbols and discover meaning in the world around us:
"Now life is above all things else at any moment subversive of life as
it was the moment before – always new, irregular."</p>

<p>The poem that's placed just after this in the anthology is one of
Williams's greatest and it, too, as it appears in the volume <i>Spring
and All</i> has no title but is given a title here – the title of the
volume itself – but was known rather for a long time simply by its
first line, "By the road to the contagious hospital." The poem is about
the continual newness that Williams calls life, something that's
continually constructing the world around us. And the poet in this poem
gets at it – like the postimpressionist painter, even perhaps like the
dadaist – by calling his and our attention to the act of constructing
his poem, and in particular as that construction is felt, as it's kind
of brought to our consciousness through enjambment. Williams's poetry,
like the world he sees, is constantly enjambed, segmented, renewed by
that act. Let's look at how enjambment works here.</p>

<blockquote>By the road to the contagious hospital<br />
 under the surge of the blue<br />
 mottled clouds driven from the<br />
 northeast--a cold wind. Beyond, the<br />
 waste of broad, muddy fields<br />
 brown with dried weeds, standing and fallen<br />
<br />
patches of standing water<br />
 the scattering of tall trees<br />
<br />
All along the road the reddish<br />
 purplish, forked, upstanding, twiggy<br />
 stuff of bushes and small trees<br />
 with dead, brown leaves under them<br />
 leafless vines --<br />
<br />
Lifeless [again, dead] in appearance, sluggish<br />
 dazed spring approaches [that is the first verb in the poem] –<br />
<br />
 They [he now says, suggesting all of these things] enter the new
world<br />
 naked, cold, uncertain of all<br />
 save that they enter. All about them [these things, the things of
the<br />
 world] the cold, familiar wind --<br />
<br />
Now the grass, tomorrow<br />
 the stiff curl of wildcarrot leaf<br />
<br />
One by one objects are defined [like a series of Imagist poems]--<br />
 It [now not "they" but "it," which is again now here a world felt in
its<br />
 wholeness] quickens: clarity, outline of leaf<br />
<br />
But now the stark dignity of<br />
 entrance-- Still, the profound change<br />
 has come upon them: rooted, they<br />
 grip down and begin to awaken.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>It's a great poem, and enjambment is a key part of its energy. The
first enjambment that is striking, is bold – it's one of the really
famous ones, in fact, in modern poetry – is that second line, "under
the surge of the blue." It invites us to read "the blue" as a noun, and
to feel and hear that phrase, "the surge of the blue," as a kind of
conventional expression of lyric romantic exaltation. But we're wrong.
"Blue" is an adjective, and we learn this as the poem turns and the
enjambment supplies the information that this blue, this kind of
exalted thing is actually "mottled," marred or flawed, even, in some
sense. And here the newness that the poem is going to celebrate is
going to be something we might feel mottled – that is, cold, flawed –
which is part of its claim to be new, part of its claim to represent
something really real; not to be found in previous books of poetry, but
something to be found in the living.</p>

<p>So, at this moment it seems enjambment means disestablishment, that
word of Williams's, the subversion of life as it just was, a surprise
of perception. But as in "The Red Wheelbarrow," if you think we've now
learned what enjambment means in a given context, Williams is going to
do something else. The next lines are also sharply enjambed: "mottled
clouds driven from the / northeast--a cold wind. Beyond, the / waste of
broad, muddy fields." That is itself a bold thing to have done in
poetry, to break off a line at the definite article. I'm not sure that
there's an example in poetry previously to align these examples of
lines ending in "the" with. There may well be, but it's yet a novel and
bold thing for Williams to do. But it works differently from the
previous example where the "blue" invited us to read that phrase as a
kind of noun, expressive of romantic exaltation, and then gave us the
surprise that no, it doesn't function that way, and what you thought
was pure and exalted is in fact mottled and messy. These enjambments
don't have any kind of interpretive surprise like that. The lines are
just broken that way. They don't change how we read the grammar of the
phrases, they don't force us to recast our expectations.</p>

<p>Together, though, as a series of enjambments, these lines evoke a
state in which the world is freshly taking shape, coming at us in forms
that we have to confront, that give us abrupt insistent impressions,
which are sometimes full of meaning and sometimes not. The way Williams
is constructing this poem is a poetic version of the action that the
poem's describing: the going forward into spring against the cold,
through which eventually, one by one, objects are defined; defined and
organized and energized and animated as Williams sees it. As I say, the
verb does not come in the poem until we see that phrase "spring
approaches," almost at the middle or slightly beyond the middle of the
poem. And then there is that next sentence, "they enter the new world
naked": "they" being deliberately vague, evoking the things of the
world but in a humanized way, a humanized way as we come to feel them
and see them. They enter the world just as we do, naked. And we
re-enter it naked with them, you could say. This is a poem about
emergence that identifies modern poetry – modern verse, as Williams
calls it in his letter to Monroe – identifies modern verse with the
process by which the perceptual world takes shape, grips down, rooting
itself in ordinary fact and things, and from which a kind of energy is
drawn and we begin to awaken.</p>

<p>This is probably a good place to end. I want to stress the resonance
and suggestiveness of Williams's investment in what is naked. It's a
way of envisioning the world in its primary terms. It's also a way of
calling forth a kind of human energy that is primary and again, as
Williams imagines it, modern. And here he is in the buff; I guess,
skinny dipping in New Jersey with a couple of sticks to pretend he's
Pan. So, go enjoy the spring day, keep your clothes on, and we'll talk
about maybe a little more Williams but definitely Marianne Moore next
time.</p>
