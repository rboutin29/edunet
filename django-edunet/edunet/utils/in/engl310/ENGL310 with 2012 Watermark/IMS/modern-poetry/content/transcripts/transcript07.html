<p><b>Professor Langdon Hammer</b>: Let's turn to page 527 in your
anthology where you find a famous poem by Wilfred Owen called "Dulce et
Decorum Est." And your footnote explains that that phrase is the
beginning of a line from Horace, completed at the end of the poem –
that is, in the last lines of the poem – "pro patria mori": translated
as, "It is sweet and proper"; sweet and right, decorous – "to die for
one's country."</p>

<blockquote>Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,<br />
 Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,<br />
 Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs<br />
 And towards our distant rest began to trudge.<br />
 Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots<br />
 But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;<br />
 Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots<br />
 Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.<br />
 Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!--An ecstasy of fumbling,<br />
 Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;<br />
 But someone still was yelling out and stumbling<br />
 And floundering like a man in fire or lime…<br />
 Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,<br />
 As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.<br />
 In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,<br />
 He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.<br />
<br />
 If in some smothering dreams you too could pace<br />
 Behind the wagon that we flung him in,<br />
 And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,<br />
 His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;<br />
 If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood<br />
 Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,<br />
 Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud<br />
 Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,--<br />
 My friend, you would not tell with such high zest<br />
 To children ardent for some desperate glory,<br />
 The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est<br />
 Pro patria mori.</blockquote>

<br />

<p>Paul Fussell, a literary critic who wrote a brilliant book about the
literature and culture of the First World War, speaks of irony as the
essential trope or rhetorical figure of this body of literature, World
War One poetry. Here is, in this poem, an example of irony, of a really
comparatively simple kind. What are schoolboy lines from Horace, lines
that Owen and many others would have learned in school to recite, to
have memorized--that poetry is here held up as propaganda, as a kind of
murderous lie: "it is sweet and right to die for one's country." You
can feel it in the marvelous texture of this poetry. Against Horace's
decorous and elegant Latin, there is placed Owen's Anglo-Saxon
alliterative, inflected, strongly stressed language with its rough and
actual vernacular diction.</p>

<p>The power and authority, too, of Owen's writing is, well, certified,
we feel, by that first person that speaks to us, that "I" who speaks as
a witness to war, as a describer, as someone telling a reader elsewhere
what he has seen and speaking specifically for one fallen soldier. The
reception of Owen's poetry has always been attached to a sense of Owen
as a soldier and witness to war, and indeed as a victim of war, who
died a week before the Armistice. These poems that you see the cover
for here, <i>Poems by Wilfred Owen</i>, originally appeared
posthumously after Owen's death, introduced by Siegfried Sassoon – a
comrade, fellow poet, fellow soldier. And as you can see, in addition
to the introduction, the cover advertises also a portrait of the
author. And there is Owen, in uniform, a handsome young man. This is
all, as I say, very much part of the transmission of Owen's poetry.</p>

<p>"Dulce et Decorum Est" is a great poem but the kind of irony that it
puts forward is, I think, a simple one. It is, well, it's a great poem.
There are lots of them that when I first started teaching this course I
decided I wouldn't teach. And for a number of reasons including the
sense that, gee, Yeats, Stevens, Eliot – these are hard poets and we
need as much time on them as we can in order to read their work. And
this poem seemed like one you might find and be able to read yourself,
without me there to explain it. It also is the case that probably many
of you have already read it and possibly studied it in school and
talked about it. So, at any rate, this seemed to me to be, when I
started teaching this course, reasons not to teach it.</p>

<p>Besides, well, I think the first time I taught this course was a few
years after the Gulf War, the first Gulf War; and it seemed to me, in
my historical innocence, that the irony that Owen is playing upon here,
that he's putting forward to us, was not one that I would need to talk
about in a classroom. It seemed to me as though no one would ever quote
Horace again, as anything but a lie. Of course that's not the case. You
know, as our present war has gone on, how many times have we heard
people in many different forms speaking of justifications for the
deaths of young men and women, on behalf of the nation? Well, as we
watch our President's approval ratings for his conduct of the war drop,
one wonders: could any of us really be surprised by this? And certainly
Wilfred Owen would not have been, and it seemed to me as though in fact
it was important to read Wilfred Owen and to go on thinking and talking
about his poetry.</p>

<p>And not only Owen, of course, but really the extraordinary rich body
of British World War One poetry as a whole, writing that is not by any
means all about battle, though much of it is, like that poem I just
read. Today what I want to do is give you some sense of this body of
writing. And unlike the last few lectures where I've concentrated on a
single poet and tried to make arguments about that poet and have a
thesis, today what I want to do is really just show you different poems
and different poets, a range of brilliant writing. In addition to an
opportunity to think about poetry and war, it's also a good opportunity
to start to fill out a little bit our sense of what modern poetry is or
was, what it is or was; also, what it did not become.</p>

<p>World War One destroyed an English generation. Modern poetry, as we
study it in this class and, I think, as you see it in this anthology,
is an international phenomenon. It's not--Well, we don't have a lot of
English poets on this syllabus. There's T.S. Eliot, the only great
English poet born in America. There's W.H. Auden, an English-born poet
who moved to America. Most of the figures that we study are in fact
Americans. There's Yeats, too. All of them are in a sense
internationals. And there's a range of important cultural reasons for
this. But there's also the simple fact of the war. Arguably, the great
modern English poets died in the teens, in France in 1915 or 1917, or
they survived – like Ivor Gurney, whom you have some samples from – in
a wounded and injured state. I also think it's important for us to
think about the war as an important context when we go on to read Pound
and Eliot, when we encounter in their poetry a sense of apocalyptic
change, of civilization in crisis, which can seem pretty vague
sometimes. Well, and this is true for the Yeats poems that we've been
talking about as well. Yeats is obviously writing in the context of an
Irish civil war, but it's also the case that he's writing in the shadow
of the First World War as well.</p>

<p>On July 1, 1916, more than 57,000 English troops were wounded or
dead. I think almost 20,000 on that day died, and in the Battle of the
Somme, as it unfolded, there were a million casualties. This is a scale
of human suffering and a kind of, well, a scale of human suffering that
is enormous and hard to comprehend, and leaves its shadow across the
writing that we will be reading. All the poets we will be talking about
today are men; not quite all soldiers, but most of them. I've given you
some quotes from Virginia Woolf, partly to remind us that the war did
not only exist for men, or soldiers, and that it existed in England as
much as it existed on the continent.</p>

<p>Well, with all that said by preparation, let me show you some more
poems, beginning with Thomas Hardy, on page 51. This is a little
pamphlet of war poems Hardy published in 1917 and that you can find in
the Beinecke. Hardy, arguably the greatest English poet, modern English
poet, is a figure we don't study in this course otherwise. He is a poet
from another century. He's born, in fact, twenty years before the
American Civil War. When World War One began he was seventy-four. He
wrote his poems from the perspective of rural England. It was the
setting for almost all of his novels, almost all of his poetry. And
"Channel Firing," on the bottom of 51, is also set in the west of
England, Hardy's home country, and is set right on the verge of the
First World War. It's a poem about gunnery practice. Yes, it's a
dramatic monologue spoken by one of the dead, in a graveyard:</p>

<blockquote>That night your great guns, unawares,<br />
 Shook all our coffins as we lay,<br />
 And broke the chancel window-squares,<br />
 We thought it was the Judgment-day<br />
<br />
 And sat upright. [Hardy has various gothic and supernatural fancies
that<br />
 he asks us to imagine in vivid, homely terms.] While drearisome<br />
 Arose the howl of wakened hounds: [This is all this wonderful,
observed<br />
 detail of rural life.]<br />
 The mouse let fall the altar-crumb,<br />
 The worms drew back into the mounds,<br />
<br />
 The glebe cow drooled. Till God called, 'No;<br />
 It's gunnery practice out at sea.<br />
 Just as before you went below;<br />
 The world is as it used to be: [This is not "The Second Coming." Kind
of<br />
 a reply to Yeats, although Yeats has written his poem yet.]<br />
<br />
 'All nations striving strong to make<br />
 Red war yet redder. Mad as hatters<br />
 They do no more for Christés sake<br />
 Than you who are helpless in such matters.<br />
<br />
 'That this is not the judgment-hour<br />
 For some of them's a blessed thing,<br />
 For if it were they'd have to scour<br />
 Hell's floor for so much threatening….<br />
<br />
 'Ha, ha. [Hardy's God laughs like that. Frost would have understood
it.]<br />
 It will be warmer when<br />
 I blow the trumpet (if indeed<br />
 I ever do; for you are men,<br />
 And rest eternal sorely need).' [This is God, so cruel that he will
not<br />
 deliver the Second Coming, the Day of Judgment.]<br />
<br />
 So down we lay again. 'I wonder,<br />
 Will the world ever saner be,'<br />
 Said one, 'than when He sent us under<br />
 In our indifferent century!'<br />
<br />
 And many a skeleton shook his head.<br />
 'Instead of preaching forty year,'<br />
 My neighbor Parson Thirdly said,<br />
 'I wish I had stuck to pipes and beer.'<br />
<br />
 Again the guns disturbed the hour,<br />
 Roaring their readiness to avenge,<br />
 As far inland as Stourton Tower,<br />
 And Camelot, and starlit Stonehenge.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Gunnery practice disturbs the dead, disrupts the ground. Here, war
refuses to let the dead lie in peace, with the notion that not even the
dead are safe from it, unaffected by it. The church windows shatter.
Well, in some sense this is exactly what modernity might be seen to be
doing to traditional English culture. Hardy is full of all those quaint
gothic, archaic dictions and fancies. The dead are raising their
objections here to guns that will be used very shortly in the Great
War. God reassures them, though, of course, what he says here is not
reassuring. He says that although "red war" is getting redder, it's
really as it always has been. This is not the end of the world that it
appears to be. He's not about to let mankind off the hook with Judgment
Day. The speaker-narrator lies back and wonders if the world will ever
be saner. His neighbor says, "Well, I don't think so. I wish I had
pleasured myself rather than serving that wicked God."</p>

<p>In the last stanza then there is that extraordinary shift of
perspective. The sound of the guns carries inland, into the heart of
England, and as it does it carries back also in time to Camelot and to
"starlit Stonehenge." What happens when that happens? What is the
meaning of this – the power of the sound of the guns to echo back in
time? As Hardy evokes Camelot and Stonehenge, you might read this,
understand this as, what? As dignifying and legitimating the present
firing, the present conflict? Or in some sense does it do just the
opposite? Does it suggest that England's history and its heritage and
its honor are in jeopardy? Does it in some sense demythologize the
past, demystify it, make us see Camelot and Stonehenge as part of a
barbaric history such as is about to unfold in 1914?</p>

<p>There are a couple of other Hardy poems in your anthology, memorable
and powerful, that are war poems, including on page 59, "In The Time of
'the Breaking of Nations,'" and then on the next page, "I Looked Up
From My Writing." Interesting to look at these together. In this first
poem Hardy affirms the endurance of rural life and its cycles:</p>

<blockquote><i>I</i><br />
<br />
Only a man harrowing clods<br />
 In a slow silent walk<br />
 With an old horse that stumbles and nods<br />
 Half asleep as they stalk.<br />
<br />
 <i>II</i><br />
<br />
 Only thin smoke without flame<br />
 From the heaps of couch-grass;<br />
 Yet this will go onward the same<br />
 Though Dynasties pass.<br />
<br />
 <i>III</i><br />
<br />
 Yonder a maid and her wight<br />
 Come whispering by:<br />
 War's annals will fade into night<br />
 Ere their story die.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Rural life, including rituals of love and courtship, here are
represented as poetry's truest subject and as a kind of enduring source
of social life and meaning. You could compare this poem to the poem
placed last in Yeats's last poems called "Politics" that might seem to
say something similar. In Hardy here, and in other poems, there's this
sort of wonderfully, self-consciously archaic language. Hardy wants to
use really old dialect words, when he can, and there's power in that.
And this is a poem composed in 1915. When we read "The Love Song of J.
Alfred Prufrock," when we read Pound's first <i>Canto</i>, remember
that those poems are written and published at just the same time this
poem's being written; poems with very different ways of proceeding and
different kinds of language.</p>

<p>In the second poem here, "I Looked Up From My Writing," the poet,
the first person, is being interrupted at his desk at night. He is
startled to see:</p>

<blockquote>…The moon's full gaze on me.<br />
<br />
Her meditative misty head<br />
 Was spectral in its air,<br />
 And I involuntarily said,<br />
 'What are you doing there?' [Hardy works in these song forms
that,<br />
 well, they sound like popular ballads, and he wants you to hear them
as<br />
 part of almost a kind of folk literature, which he draws on.<br />
 The moon says to him:]<br />
<br />
 'Oh, I've been scanning pond and hole<br />
 And waterway hereabout<br />
 For the body of one with a sunken soul<br />
 Who has put his life-light out.<br />
<br />
 'Did you hear his frenzied tattle?<br />
 It was sorrow for his son<br />
 Who is slain in brutish battle,<br />
 Though he has injured none.<br />
<br />
 'And now [the moon says] I am curious to look<br />
 Into the blinkered mind [the poet's]<br />
 Of one who wants to write a book<br />
 In a world of such a kind.'<br />
<br />
 Her temper [the poet then says] overwrought me,<br />
 And I edged to shun her view [to get out of the moonlight]<br />
 For I felt assured she thought me<br />
 One who should drown him too.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Here, a neighbor father, crazed with grief at the death of his son,
has drowned himself, killed himself, and the moon implies in its gaze
that the poet should do so, too. In such a world it seems writing poems
is a kind of--well, even surviving is a kind of guilty privilege. You
could compare with this poem Kipling's poem; Kipling, one of the great
apologists of empire, saying on page 153 of your book in the voice of a
soldier, "If any question why we [we soldiers] died, / tell them,
because our fathers lied" – a statement that is poignant, poignant and
powerful in part because Kipling's own son died in the war ["Epitaphs
of the War"].</p>

<p>This is a volume of poems published in 1917 by Edward Thomas and a
portrait of Thomas, another soldier poet, not represented however as a
soldier here: represented rather as an English citizen in tweed, a man
out in and of nature. Thomas was born in 1878, so he was thirty-six
when the war began. He began, almost at the same time as the war began,
to write poems. He begins writing under the influence of his friend,
Robert Frost. Frost and Thomas have a fascinating relationship, an
important transatlantic exchange. Frost's famous poem, "The Road Not
Taken," he sometimes described as being about Thomas and Thomas's own
sense of regret and hesitation and indirection, to which Frost
contrasted himself. Frost became in England a poet of New England whom
Thomas was reading at that moment in such a way as to help enable him,
Thomas, to become a great poet of England and of England's landscape
and countryside and nature. There's a good selection from Thomas in
your anthology. I will read my favorite poem by Thomas, which is the
first one, called "Adlestrop," on page 231:</p>

<blockquote>Yes, I remember Adlestrop--<br />
 The name, because one afternoon<br />
 Of heat the express-train drew up there<br />
 Unwontedly. It was late June.<br />
<br />
 The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.<br />
 No one left and no one came<br />
 On the bare platform. What I saw<br />
 Was Adlestrop--only the name<br />
<br />
 And willows, willow-herb, and grass,<br />
 And meadowsweet, and haycocks dry,<br />
 No whit less still and lonely fair<br />
 Than the high cloudlets in the sky.<br />
<br />
 And for that minute a blackbird sang<br />
 Close by, and round him, mistier,<br />
 Farther and farther, all the birds<br />
 Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>It's a wonderful poem in its simplicity, modesty, directness, and
reticence which yet provides the most expansive and exhilarating sense
of the English landscape and of the power of a moment in time to
enlarge and be pregnant with meaning. Notice Thomas's really superb
nonchalance and offhandedness and simplicity. "It was late June." "The
steam hissed." There's a kind of colloquial clarity and confidence,
quite different from the vernacular language in the Hardy poems I was
just reading, which are also poems of the countryside. Here the name,
the odd name "Adlestrop," prompts a memory, prompts a memory in such a
way that a moment in time stands out, separated from other moments;
just as the odd, unpoetic, unbeautiful name "Adlestrop" seems to stand
out. There's a kind of poignant tension between the unbeautifulness of
the name, the awkwardness, and yet the dignity of the name, and the
sense of natural beauty that the poem will unfold.</p>

<p>Here, the stopping of the train is like the interruption by memory
of normal consciousness that's the basis of the poem. There's a sense
that in this memory the poet somehow saw the name--presumably, I
suppose, saw it on a signboard in the station, as you roll into the
station and you see where you are. But there's more suggestion in it
than that. It's as if this moment were one in which the name and the
place, the word and the thing, fully coincided, fully coincided in an
experience of presence and immediacy where the world is all there and
named, located, placed. The figure, the metaphor for this semiotic
unity of word and thing is bird-song. Here bird-song is a kind of
natural language, a language in which nature speaks, and speaks in such
a way that the particular voice carries the import and authority of the
general, just as the one bird seems to sing with many bird-songs by the
end of the poem. And so Adlestrop itself suddenly seems to signify
more, calling to mind in kind of rippling and radiating circles
Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, England – all of it, the poet's home.</p>

<p>At the same time it's also clear that this epiphany is a remembered
experience. It's recalled. The poet's first word, "yes" – a wonderful
affirmation – situates the poem in a dialogue as if someone had just
said, "Have you ever been to Adlestrop?" Whether this dialogue is
actual or internal, it doesn't really matter. Part of the poem's force
derives from the status of this moment as something remembered, and
remembered within the context of a nation at war. Although I believe
Thomas wrote the poem the year he enlisted but, I think, before his
enlistment, you might feel as though Thomas is already on the train for
France. There's a way in which the context of the war, too, shadows the
poem and remains present in it. Don't you feel it in certain details:
the eerie lack of people in this place? "No one left and no one came."
In a sense it is an image of the English countryside at a moment in
which it is being emptied out, its young men sent to France to die, a
kind of no man's land already.</p>

<p>This is Siegfried Sassoon in uniform in 1916. Sassoon's poetry
centers on hallucinatory overlays of home-front and battle-front. Let's
look at "'Blighters'" on page 389, a wonderfully angry poem; a poem
that is situated in a music hall, presumably a London music hall:</p>

<blockquote>The House is crammed; tier beyond tier they grin<br />
 And cackle at the Show, while prancing ranks<br />
 Of harlots shrill the chorus, drunk with din;<br />
 'We're sure the Kaiser loves the dear old Tanks!'<br />
<br />
 I'd like to see a Tank come down the stalls,<br />
 Lurching to rag-time tunes, or 'Home, sweet Home',<br />
 And there'd be no more jokes in Music-halls<br />
 To mock the riddled corpses round Bapaume.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Here, there's an analogy between the music hall and the theater of
war. It's as if the English populace were spectators only, consuming as
entertainment war propaganda, which makes the poet hate them. He
imagines here the eruption of the real into this representational
space, and imagines it as a kind of attack on the working and middle
class audiences of the music hall. The soldier becomes, in fantasy
here, the spectator, as the war turns around and comes back, reversed
by a kind of evil charm or spell, coming home. And "home" is here made
to rhyme with "Bapaume," bringing battlefront and home front together
as a rhyme. There's an aggression towards the urban crowd here that
recalls and exaggerates Yeats's attitude at the same time, really in
the same years, in poems like "A Coat" or "The Fisherman."</p>

<p>In other Sassoon poems, the war comes home in other ways. For
example, in "The Rear-Guard," just down the page here; or "Repression
of War Experience," which is about traumatic repetition of battle; or
in "Dreamers," where there is, again, a kind of juxtaposing of life in
the trenches and life in the city. Rather than dwell longer on them
though, and to make sure I get time for a couple more poems, I want to
move on and consider--Here is a collection of Sassoon's poems,
<i>Counter-Attack</i>, and this is <i>The Poetry of Isaac
Rosenberg</i>. Here's a frontispiece with Rosenberg in a military coat.
Rosenberg, besides a poet, was also an artist and created these
self-portraits. "Self-Portrait in France, 1915." Rosenberg, in contrast
to Sassoon, was poor, Jewish, and writes a rather different kind of
poem from those we have been looking at today. One of the most famous
and extraordinary is "Louse Hunting," on page 506; a little bit further
on in your book:</p>

<blockquote>Nudes--stark and glistening,<br />
 Yelling in lurid glee. Grinning faces<br />
 And raging limbs<br />
 Whirl over the floor one fire.<br />
 For a shirt verminously busy<br />
 Yon soldier tore from his throat, with oaths<br />
 Godhead might shrink at, but not the lice.<br />
 And soon the shirt was aflare<br />
 Over the candle he'd lit while we lay.<br />
<br />
Then we all sprang up and stript<br />
 To hunt the verminous brood. [Here the soldiers are stripping
their<br />
 clothes off and attacking the lice that are attacking them.]<br />
 Soon like a demons' pantomime<br />
 The place was raging. [It's nighttime and the candles and flares
are<br />
 throwing shadows.]<br />
 See the silhouettes agape,<br />
 See the gibbering shadows<br />
 Mixed with the battled arms on the wall.<br />
 See gargantuan hooked fingers<br />
 Pluck in supreme flesh<br />
 To smutch supreme littleness.<br />
 See the merry limbs in hot Highland fling<br />
 Because some wizard vermin<br />
 Charmed from the quiet this revel<br />
 When our ears were half lulled<br />
 By the dark music<br />
 Blown from Sleep's trumpet.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>A strange place for this poem to end. "Nudes," the poem begins. It's
shocking and comic and pleasurable to see the armored men, uniformed
men suddenly exposed – just naked bodies – to see them here bedeviled
not by a gas attack or machine guns but lice, fleas. Rosenberg is
writing not in those little crafted stanzas of Hardy or, for that
matter, of Thomas. He's writing in a kind of strongly stressed free
verse with variable line lengths, lots of--well there's a sense in
which the poetry itself is exuberant and naked and full of life and
vital; and naturalistic, you could say, in its representation.
Rosenberg is giving us an anecdote from the trenches, and yet it slips
very quickly into a sense of fable. The louse hunting, where these big
men hunt these little things, these fleas: it becomes – when it's
thrown by shadow as a kind of flickering image on the tent or trench
wall, when it becomes represented, so to speak – it becomes a battle
scene where gigantic forces "smutch supreme littleness." We are put in
mind of how men are to the Gods as flies to men. This is an analogy as
old as, and found in, Homer. We are also put in mind of how the war is,
in fact, anything but a revel, though it, too, may have been provoked
by a cause as insignificant and hard to trace as "some wizard
vermin."</p>

<p>Those last lines, then, are so ominous and strange. Though these men
have been brought to life from sleep, there's a sense that the trumpet
will sound for them again and they will enter a dark sleep from which
they won't wake, which is just the point of the next poem, "Returning,
We Hear the Larks." I won't take time to read it, though, or talk about
it, but instead I'd like to conclude--This is another great poet of the
war who survived, though in, as I say, a wounded condition mentally,
Ivor Gurney. I want to conclude with a poem by Owen. Let's see, this is
page 528, just following "Dulce et Decorum Est," "Strange Meeting."
This is a poem that--well, if the first poem demystifies one crucial
thread of war ideology, that it is right and good to die for the
country, this poem takes on another crucial element of war ideology
that the enemy is an "other": the enemy is unlike me. Like Rosenberg,
like Rosenberg's poem, this one comes out of and returns eventually to
sleep. It is a kind of dream vision, Dantesque in its mode, and full of
powerful iambic pentameter:</p>

<blockquote>It seemed that out of battle I escaped<br />
 Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped<br />
 Through granites which titanic wars had groined.<br />
 Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned,<br />
 Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred.<br />
 Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared<br />
 With piteous recognition in fixed eyes,<br />
 Lifting distressful hands, as if to bless.<br />
 And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall,--<br />
 By his dead smile I knew we stood in Hell.<br />
<br />
 With a thousand pains that vision's face was grained;<br />
 Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground,<br />
 And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan.<br />
 'Strange friend,' I said, 'here is no cause to mourn.'<br />
 'None,' said the other, 'save the undone years,<br />
 The hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours,<br />
 Was my life also; I went hunting wild<br />
 After the wildest beauty in the world,<br />
 Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair,<br />
 But mocks the steady running of the hour,<br />
 And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here.<br />
 For by my glee might many men have laughed,<br />
 And of my weeping something had been left,<br />
 Which must die now. I mean the truth untold,<br />
 The pity of war, the pity war distilled.<br />
 Now men will go content with what we spoiled,<br />
 Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled.<br />
 They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress.<br />
 None will break ranks, tough nations trek from progress.<br />
 Courage was mine, and I had mystery,<br />
 Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery:<br />
 To miss the march of this retreating world<br />
 Into vain citadels that are not walled.<br />
 Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels,<br />
 I would go up and wash them from sweet wells,<br />
 Even with truths that lie too deep for taint.<br />
 I would have poured my spirit without stint<br />
 But not through wounds; not on the cess of war.<br />
 Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were.<br />
 'I am the enemy you killed, my friend.<br />
 I knew you in this dark: for so you frowned<br />
 Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed.<br />
 I parried; but my hands were loath and cold.<br />
 Let us sleep now….'</blockquote>

period and associated with Imagism on Monday.</p>
