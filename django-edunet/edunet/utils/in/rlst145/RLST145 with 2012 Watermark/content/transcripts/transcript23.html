<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> All right, let's go ahead and get
started; there's a lot to cover. But I want to try to unite a lot of
these disparate parts of the Bible, the many small books clustered here
at the end that we'll be considering. I'm going to try to unite them by
elaborating certain themes as we move through them. But as you can see,
from this giant chart, there's quite a bit.</p>

<p>First, let's begin with the Book of Ruth. The Book of Ruth is set in
the days of the Judges; that's the opening line of the book. It tells
you that this happened in the days of Judges, but it was certainly
written later, and whether it was post-exilic or pre-exilic is not
certain, so we're going to be asking the questions of a canonical
critic.</p>

<p>Whatever its origin, how did this book function for Second Temple
Jews? As the story of a foreign woman, whose foreign status is
continually emphasized throughout the book, (Ruth the Moabite, Ruth the
Moabitess)-- as a foreign woman who acts nobly and enters the community
of Israel by choice, this story would have stood in opposition to the
negative view of foreigners, the ban on intermarriage and the purely
genealogical definition of Israelite identity that was promulgated by
Ezra and Nehemiah in the post-exilic period.</p>

<p>So in the story you have a famine in Judah and that causes a
Bethlehemite man, Elimelech and his wife Naomi, and their two children
to leave Judah. They're going to reside in the country of Moab, where
the Moabites live, and their two sons marry Moabite women, Orpah and
Ruth.</p>

<p>You have to consider the effect that these opening verses would have
had on an ancient Israelite listener or reader. Moab was a hostile
neighbor on Israel's southeastern border. And the Moabites were hated
for their ill-treatment of the Israelites when they were traveling to
the Promised Land. Their lack of hospitality had already led to a
prohibition of intermarriage in the Torah itself. So the Moabites and
Ammonites are two foreign groups that are explicitly prohibited from
entering the congregation in Deuteronomy 23.</p>

<p>The Israelites' low opinion of the Moabites is also expressed in
Genesis in the very degrading story of Moab's descent from the
incestuous relationship between Lot and one of his daughters, after the
fall of Sodom. And yet here we read, in the opening lines of this story
[of] a man from Bethlehem, who travels to Moab, and his two sons marry
Moabite women!</p>

<p>Then in short order Elimelech and his two sons (who are
appropriately named Sickness and Death, by the way, in Hebrew) they
die. And the Israelite widow, Naomi, is left now with no blood
relation, no blood male relation, only her two Moabite
daughters-in-law. And Naomi weepily tells the girls that they should
return to their father's home. She's poor, she'll never be able to
support them as a poor widow, she has no further sons to give to them,
and clearly they have no legal or moral obligation or tie to Naomi. And
we'll pick up the story then in chapter 1:11:</p>

<blockquote>But Naomi replied, "Turn back, my daughters! Why should you
go with me? Have I any more sons in my body who might be husbands for
you? Turn back, my daughters, for I am too old to be married. Even if I
thought there was hope for me, even if I married tonight and I also
bore sons, should you wait for them to grow up? Should you on their
account debar yourselves from marriage? Oh no, my daughters! My lot is
far more bitter than yours, for the hand of the Lord has struck out
against me."<br />
<br />
They broke into weeping again, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law
farewell. But Ruth clung to her. So she said, "See, your sister-in-law
has returned to her people and her gods. Go follow your sister-in-law."
But Ruth replied, "Do not urge me to leave you, to turn back and not
follow you. For wherever you go, I will go; wherever you lodge, I will
lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God. Where you
die, I will die, and there I will be buried. Thus and more may the Lord
do to me if even death parts me from you." When [Naomi] saw how
determined she was to go with her, she ceased to argue with her; and
the two went on until they reached Bethlehem.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>All of the names in this story are wonderfully symbolic. Sickness
and Death â€“ it's like they walk on the stage with a big sign saying
"I'm in a bit part and I'm ready to die." Orpah's name means the back
of the neck because she turns her back on her mother-in-law as well.
It's a wonderful story with lots of name symbolisms.</p>

<p>But by the force of sheer conviction, Ruth joins herself to the
people of her mother-in-law. Back in Judah, Ruth supports her
mother-in-law and herself by gleaning the fallen sheaves behind the
reapers in the field. Because according to the Pentateuch, the sheaves
that fall behind the reapers must be left for the poor to collect; you
don't go back and collect them. So Ruth gleans, and she gleans in the
field of a kinsman named Boaz, and he's described as a man of substance
and she's very diligent and she soon comes to his attention.</p>

<p>He's very kind to her, he looks out for her safety among the rough
field workers. He provides water for her. He's heard of what Ruth has
done for Naomi; how she left her home and left her family to come to a
people that she really didn't know, and he blesses her. He says, "May
the Lord reward your deeds. May you have a full recompense from the
Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have sought refuge!"
chapter 2:12.</p>

<p>He increases his generosity; he shares his meal with Ruth and gives
her from the heaps of grain in addition to the gleanings that she's
collecting. So Naomi is very delighted with Ruth's gleanings, they more
than suffice for their needs. But she's even more pleased to learn that
Ruth seems to have found favor in the eyes of Boaz. He's been very kind
and generous, and she points out: you know he is among our redeeming
kinsmen. Now the term here, the Hebrew term is <i>goel. Goel</i> means
redeemer. In fact, in a lot of the Christian language later, this is
the word they're using when they talk about "my redeemer liveth." It's
simply this word <i>goel</i>, and the <i>goel</i> is a person who as
the nearest relative or as a close relative, has certain legal
obligations to another person.</p>

<p>Those obligations--the primary obligations are three: (1)To redeem
the person or their property if they've been sold to a stranger due to
poverty. So to redeem them from debt servitude essentially. So your
<i>goel</i> should do that for you. (2)To marry a childless widow. So
if a man dies and his wife is childless the <i>goel</i> is supposed to
marry her, provide seed, and the firstborn son will be named after the
name who is dead. So he's supposed to marry a childless widow and
produce offspring for the deceased; usually, that falls first to the
brother; And then (3) in the case of the blood redeemer, also the
redeemer is supposed to avenge the blood of a kinsman. So if you are
killed your redeemer is supposed to seek vengeance for you.</p>

<p>Boaz is a somewhat distant relative, but Naomi believes he's the
answer to their dual problem of poverty on the one hand, and Ruth's
widowhood on the other hand. So in chapter 3 she urges Ruth to make a
visit to Boaz. He's winnowing barley on the threshing floor and Ruth is
supposed to bathe herself, anoint herself, dress up and go out at night
to the threshing floor.</p>

<p>You should know that biblically, threshing floors tend to be places
of revelry at the end of the harvest time and they are often frequented
by prostitutes. But Naomi seems to be planning Ruth's seduction of
Boaz. She instructs Ruth not to reveal herself until Boaz has finished
eating and drinking, and when he lies down, Ruth is to approach him and
uncover his feet--this is possibly a sexual euphemism--and lie down,
and he will tell her what she is to do.</p>

<p>So Ruth follows these instructions exactly. In 3:7-11:</p>

<blockquote>Boaz ate and drank, and in a cheerful mood went to lie down
beside the grainpile. Then she went over stealthily and uncovered his
feet and lay down. In the middle of the night, the man gave a start and
pulled back--there was a woman lying at his feet! "Who are you?" he
asked. And she replied, "I am your handmaid Ruth. Spread your robe over
you handmaid, for you are a redeeming kinsman." [a <i>goel</i>] He
exclaimed, "Be blessed of the Lord, daughter! Your latest deed of
loyalty is greater than the first, in that you have not turned to
younger men, whether poor or rich. And now, daughter, have no fear. I
will do in your behalf whatever you ask, for all the elders of my town
know what a fine woman you are."</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So Ruth's request is that Boaz act as her redeemer and spread his
robe over her, which is a formal act of protection and espousal. And
Boaz assures her that he will redeem her. He then goes on to point out,
however, that there is another kinsman who is actually a closer
relation, and therefore has the first right of refusal, and Boaz will
settle the matter legally in the morning. And we're left wondering what
transpired in the night.</p>

<p>In chapter 4 we read the legal proceeding by which the other kinsman
is freed of his obligation and his claim to Ruth and this then clears
the way, enables Boaz to marry her. But the punchline to the whole
story is yet to come and that occurs in chapter 4, verses 13-17,</p>

<blockquote>So Boaz married Ruth; she became his wife, and he cohabited
with her. The Lord let her conceive, and she bore a son. And the women
said to Naomi, "Blessed by the Lord, who has not withheld a redeemer
from you today! May his name be perpetuated in Israel! He will renew
your life and sustain your old age; for he is born of your
daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons."
Naomi took the child and held it to her bosom. She became its foster
mother, and the women neighbors gave him a name saying, "A son is born
to Naomi!" They named him Obed; he was the father of Jesse, father of
David.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So David, God's anointed king over Israel; David, with whom God
covenanted that his house should reign forever; David, from whose line
would come the messianic king to rule in the final age--This David is
said to be the direct descendant, the great grandson of a foreign woman
from a country of idol worshippers, and a Moabitess no less.</p>

<p>So it seems that this very short and very moving story represents a
strand of thought that stood in opposition to the line of thinking
found, for example, in Ezra's call for a ban on intermarriage as the
only means of insuring faithfulness to Israel's God. Not only is Ruth,
the Moabitess, not guilty of abominable practices, she is the
ancestress of Yahweh's chosen monarch. And she's praised in the story
by all who know her as a paragon of <i>hesed</i>, this quality of
steadfast love and covenantal loyalty that binds the members of the
covenant community to one another and to God. Ruth, the Moabitess,
stood by an elderly widow to whom she had no real legal obligation and
she was accepted into the covenant community.</p>

<p>The acceptance of foreigners is well documented in post-exilic
Judaism, despite Ezra's polemical efforts to exclude foreigners from
the community. It's important to remember that Ezra's reforms never
became normative for the entire community. Post-exilic, and later
rabbinic Judaism, never adopted the purely genealogical definition of
Jewish identity. They allowed for the phenomenon of conversion and
marriage into the covenant by persons of foreign birth who accepted the
God of Israel; a possibility that Ezra completely forecloses.</p>

<p>Ezra's extreme views were popular among sectarian groups, so Ezra
and exclusivism is championed, for example, in writings that are found
at Qumram. It exerted some influence on early Christian bans on
marriage, absolute bans on marriage between believers and unbelievers,
but it's the Book of Ruth that features prominently in the Jewish
conversion ceremony to this day.</p>

<p>We have a different kind of acceptance of foreigners that's voiced
by prophets of the restoration period. So these are prophets, fifth
century--late sixth and fifth century. We're going to look now briefly
at some of the last prophetic books, and these are writings that date
to the time of the first generations of returned exiles and on.</p>

<p>Earlier prophets in the pre-exilic period--the classical prophets
we've already looked at--they had spoken of a remnant that would be
restored and would be restored gloriously to its land, but the returned
exiles faced a life of great hardship. The reality of poverty and the
difficulties in rebuilding the temple, and the hostility of the Judeans
who had remained behind, as well as the hostility of the surrounding
peoples, the absence of any real political independence under a Davidic
King--all of these things fell far short of the early prophets'
glorious descriptions of this restored remnant.</p>

<p>So new prophets in the period of the Restoration have to address the
community's disappointment. The short Book of Haggai contains the words
of the Prophet Haggai, spoken primarily to Zerubabbel, (Zerubabbel is
the governor of Judea). Haggai prophesies around 520, and he declares
that all of the difficulties the community was facing, the agricultural
setbacks and the famines, these were all signs of God's displeasure
that the temple hadn't been completed.</p>

<p>Zerubabbel is convinced by this, the people return to their task
enthusiastically, and as we know, the temple is rebuilt as Haggai
promised. He says it's a humble structure but soon it's going to be
filled with treasures flowing in from all nations. And the promises of
the Restoration that were made by the prophets of old are just around
the corner.</p>

<p>So Haggai longed for a rebuilt temple. But not only that, also for
the re-establishment of Judah's independence under a Davidic King. And
he held out hope for Zerubabbel, the governor, who was, after all, a
descendant of David, through the last king that went into exile. He
hoped that he would serve as God's messiah, or appointed king. That
hope is even stronger in the work of Haggai's contemporary, the
prophet, Zechariah.</p>

<p>Zechariah is 14 chapters long, and the first eight chapters contain
the prophecies of the historical Zechariah around 520 or so. The last
chapters--chapters 9 through 14, this is known as Second
Zechariah--these chapters contain obscure writings from a later hand
and they are of a very different type or genre. They are written in the
apocalyptic vein, so we won't talk about those now, we'll consider
those momentarily. I'm going to be talking about apocalyptic for the
last half of the lecture. So for right now I'm interested, however, in
the first eight chapters which represent the oracles of the historical
prophet Zechariah around 520.</p>

<p>He preached and prophesied for about two years. He urges in these
chapters the rebuilding of the temple. The first six chapters contain a
series of elaborate and symbolic visions, eight different visions that
are revealed by an angel and/or a divine messenger. That's a mode of
revelation that's going to be standard in apocalyptic literature, as
we'll soon see. Earlier prophets received a word or a vision but as we
move towards apocalyptic literature and later literature, prophets
often receive messages from God through an angel or a messenger.</p>

<p>These visions focus hope on Zerubabbel, the governor, and on the
priest Joshua, the high priest Joshua. And the idea is that they'll
rule in a kind of diarchy as monarch and priest. At the same time,
however, it seems that the Persians got rid of Zerubabbel. He was
ousted perhaps because messianic hope was starting to gather around
Zerubabbel. So Zechariah's prophesies seem to be adjusted to refer
solely to Joshua. Although they originally referred to Zerubabbel, and
although chapter 6 in particular seems to refer originally to
Zerubabbel, it is altered so that it now depicts Joshua as a shoot or a
branch from Jesse's stock--Jesse's stock, meaning a Davidide. (David's
father was Jesse; so to say a root from Jesse's stock is to say a
Davidide.) It says that Joshua will rebuild the sanctuary; he will wear
the royal insignia, although he is the priest. The elevation, however,
of the high priest is a feature of the post-exilic period. It's a
feature of Judah in the post-exilic period, the high priest coming to
take [on] some of the trappings of royal office.</p>

<p>Chapters 7 and 8, declare God's promise to turn and to do good
things in Jerusalem and the House of Judah, so long as the people will
turn from their unjust and evil ways. And Zechariah points forward to
the glorious day when all the nations of the world will eagerly come to
seek the Lord in Jerusalem and to entreat his favor.</p>

<p>So we read in Zechariah 8:23, "Thus said the Lord of Hosts: In those
days, ten men from nations of every tongue will take hold--they will
take hold of every Jew by a corner of his cloak and say, 'Let us go
with you, for we have heard that God is with you,'" and thus this
Restoration period, you can see, features prophets who envision other
nations joining Israel in the worship of Yahweh. They will come to
rally around and join Israel in the worship of God in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The last wave of prophetic writings that we have addresses the
disappointment and the disillusionment of late sixth- and fifth-century
Judeans. What was the message of these writings? The basic message was
that the earlier prophets, their promises of future glory for the
restored remnant--these were all true. The future just isn't now. It's
only going to happen in the <i>eschaton</i>, the final day. Only then
will the glory of Jerusalem and a messianic ruler be restored, and the
hope that has to sustain the community through the bleak present is
therefore an eschatological hope, a hope that focuses on an ideal
account of the end, (eschatology = an account of the end). Because in
the end of days everything will be set right. So as we move later into
the period, we find increasingly the hope for the community is thrust
off into the future, in an eschatology.</p>

<p>Parts of Third Isaiah depict the bitter reality of life in
post-exilic Judah and advance in eschatology. You remember the Book of
Isaiah, which is 66 chapters, we divided into three parts: 1 through
39, which is the historical Isaiah; then we have Second Isaiah; and
then ThirdIsaiah, we're dealing with now--that's chapters 56 to 66.</p>

<p>The anonymous prophetic author of these chapters denounces the
failings of the exiles, but does hold out an eschatology; a doctrine of
final things that depicts what's going to happen in the end of days.
This kind of eschatology differs from the depiction of Zion's future
glory that we had in the early classical prophets. The earlier
prophetic pronouncements generally referred to a re-establishment of
Judah's fortunes in historical time, but eschatological works like
Third Isaiah look beyond historical time. They're looking to a time of
a new heaven and a new earth, when Judah's sins will be forgotten. The
land will become an earthly paradise transformed, and blessed with
peace and prosperity and length of days.</p>

<p>This is from Isaiah 65:17-25,</p>

<blockquote>For behold! I am creating<br />
A new heaven and a new earth;<br />
The former things shall not be remembered,<br />
They shall never come to mind.<br />
Be glad, then, and rejoice forever<br />
In what I am creating.<br />
For I shall create Jerusalem as a joy,<br />
And her people as a delight;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Never again shall be heard there<br />
 The sounds of weeping and wailing.<br />
 No more shall there be an infant or graybeard<br />
 Who does not live out his days.<br />
 He who dies at a hundred years<br />
 Shall be reckoned a youth,<br />
 And he who fails to reach a hundred<br />
 Shall be reckoned accursed.<br />
 â€¦For the days of My people shall be<br />
 As long as the days of the tree,<br />
 My chosen ones shall outlive<br />
 The work of their hands.<br />
 They shall not toil to no purpose;<br />
 They shall not bear children for terror,<br />
 But they shall be a people blessed by the Lord,<br />
 And their offspring shall remain with them.<br />
 Before they pray, I will answer;<br />
 While they are still speaking, I will respond.<br />
 The wolf and the lamb shall graze together,<br />
 And the lion shall eat straw like the ox,<br />
 And the serpent's food shall be earth.In all My sacred mount<br />
 Nothing evil or vile shall be done--said the Lord.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>See this interesting notion of a completely new, transformed heaven
and earth. The lion is vegetarian again, the serpent no longer
is--there's not this animosity between the serpent and humans as was
decreed at the end of Genesis with the curse on the serpent. They're
going to just be eating earth and there will be no danger.</p>

<p>Third Isaiah also sounds this theme of openness, reassuring
foreigners and eunuchs who have joined themselves to Yahweh that
they'll be welcome in the Holy Temple to serve God and to offer
sacrifices. Now, this is significant. Again, remember that Deuteronomy
23 right in the heart of the Pentateuch, bans eunuchs specifically, and
certain foreigners--Moabites, Ammonites--from entering the
congregation. Remember also that Ezekiel explicitly excluded foreigners
from the restored temple in his visions at the end of the book. This is
also clearly the policy of Ezra and Nehemiah. They had an Ammonite who
had his lodgings or office or room in the temple--they had him thrown
out of that area in the temple.</p>

<p>Third Isaiah seems to oppose such restrictions. Isaiah 56:3-7:</p>

<blockquote>Let not the foreigner say,<br />
Who has attached himself to the Lord,<br />
"The Lord will keep me apart from his people";<br />
And let not the eunuchs say,<br />
"I am a withered tree."<br />
For thus said the Lord:<br />
"As for the eunuchs who keep My sabbaths,<br />
Who have chosen what I desire<br />
And hold fast to My covenant--<br />
I will give them, in My House<br />
And within My walls,<br />
A monument and a name<br />
Better than sons or daughters.<br />
I will give them an everlasting name<br />
Which shall not perish.<br />
As for the foreigners<br />
Who attach themselves to the Lord,<br />
To minister to Him,<br />
And to love the name of the Lord,<br />
To be His servants--<br />
All who keep the Sabbath and do not profane it,<br />
And who hold fast to my covenant.<br />
<br />
â€¦I will bring them to My sacred mount<br />
And let them rejoice in My house of prayer.<br />
Their burnt offerings and sacrifices<br />
Shall be welcome on My altar;<br />
For My House shall be called<br />
A house of prayer for all peoples."</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So on this issue clearly the post-exilic community was quite
divided.</p>

<p>Now, there's only one biblical book, which pretty much in its
entirety, belongs to the genre of literature known as apocalyptic. Not
in its entirety, but it is the most significant and through-going
apocalyptic book in the Bible.</p>

<p>The term apocalyptic derives from the Greek word <i>apocalypsis</i>.
An <i>apocalypsis</i> is a revealing, so something that's apocalyptic
is a revealing. Apocalypse is a revelation of things to come, and as
apocalypses generally predict the end of historical time and the
beginning of a new world order, they are generally concerned with
eschatology; so apocalyptic works tend to be eschatological.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean all eschatological work is apocalyptic.
Apocalyptic literature within the Bible, and then much more
significantly outside the Hebrew Bible, is characterized by certain
distinguishing features which I've thrown up in brief note form over
here. So apocalyptic literature is always eschatological, deals with
the end of time. But to be apocalyptic a work has to have certain kinds
of features and not all eschatologies have these features.</p>

<p>This is what they are. Most apocalyptic writings are pseudonymous.
They're generally attributed to important figures of the past, Enoch or
Abraham or someone. They tend to also feature a revelation by a
heavenly messenger, an angel who comes in a vision or a dream to
deliver some sort of message. In general, the message is highly
symbolic. It's coded and often the symbolism is quite bizarre. You'll
have surreal images of beasts and monsters and usually these depict
foreign nations.</p>

<p>The visions tend to be chronological. They tend to be a systematic
chronology of past, present and future events that represent the march
of history, in coded form again, and so it tends to require
interpretation. And that's usually given by the divine messenger, who
reveals the symbolic chronological code.</p>

<p>Fourthly, apocalypses tend to predict a series of catastrophes.
These are signs of the coming of the end, that final point in the march
of history that's being laid out. You have motifs from ancient myths
very often used to describe these catastrophes. I'll come back to that
in a minute.</p>

<p>Apocalypses also tend to be what I call morally dualistic. They tend
to divide humankind into two mutually exclusive groups; the righteous
which is always a tiny minority, and the wicked, which is always the
vast majority. There's going to be some final public judgment and the
righteous will be saved and the wicked will be destroyed.</p>

<p>In this respect, especially later apocalypses show the influence of
Persian thought. Persian thought is also quite dualist in nature, with
oppositions of light and darkness, or good and evil, and life and death
and so on. So there does seem to be some Persian influence and of
course we're well into the Persian period at this point.</p>

<p>A sixth feature is that God generally appears in apocalyptic
literature as an enthroned king. He brings all of history to a crashing
end, and demonstrates his sovereignty. He confounds the wicked; he does
all of these things at the same time. He confounds the wicked and
establishes himself as the sovereign and enthroned king, in
control.</p>

<p>Seventh, apocalyptic literature, as I briefly mentioned before,
often incorporates mythological motifs and imagery, especially the
motif of a battle between God and primordial, chaotic elements. And
that will often be the imagery that's used in depicting the final
battle with the godless or the wicked.</p>

<p>Apocalypses also generally depict a judgment of the individual dead,
followed by everlasting life or punishment. So again, apocalypses
develop quite substantially outside the writings of the Hebrew Bible;
and in the Bible, we have a few scattered apocalyptic elements and then
much of the Book of Daniel. And so we don't see the idea of life after
death really in the Hebrew Bible until this very late apocalyptic book
of Daniel.</p>

<p>The idea is very influential in the Dead Sea Scrolls (they are very
dualist) and in the writings of the New Testament of course. So a
belief in personal immortality, a belief in a general resurrection of
the dead--these arise from a negative view of this world as a place
where justice can be obtained. So apocalyptic writers examined the
world they lived in; they drew the conclusion that reward and
punishment were going to be made in an afterlife. They were certainly
not doled out in this life, as Israel suffered.</p>

<p>This is a marked break from the general conviction of the Hebrew
Bible that human life is limited to this world, and that the
fundamental concern of humans and God is morality in this life and not
immortality in another.</p>

<p>I think apocalyptic literature can be described as a literature of
hope and despair. It's a literature of despair or pessimism because its
basic premise is that this world holds out no promise for the
righteous. It's a literature of hope or optimism because it affirms
that God will intervene. He will intervene in human history, he'll set
everything right, he'll interrupt the natural order, he's going to
destroy this broken world as we know it, and he'll do so in order to
rescue the righteous and humiliate the wicked, and if you've already
died don't worry there will be a resurrection, it will all be made
right. But this hope for supreme and ultimate vindication is thrust off
into the future. So apocalyptic constitutes yet one more response to
the traumatic events, the crises, and the disappointments of Israel's
history.</p>

<p>In a second we'll get to Daniel, but there are a few apocalyptic
passages of varying length in other post-exilic books. I'll just touch
on them very quickly. SecondZechariah and, a little bit, the book of
Joel, just to prepare us for Daniel.</p>

<p>Second Zechariah. Now, these are chapters 9 through 14. We talked
about the historical Zechariah, chapters 1 through 8, so this is Second
Zechariah, chapters 9 through 14, and it's a collection of diverse
oracles, probably fifth-century or later, that contain these strange
visions and predictions. Their meanings cannot always be fathomed, but
they seem to focus on the Day of the Lord, and the restoration of
Jerusalem, and the rise of a new and humble king who will reign in
peace, really over a new world order.</p>

<p>Chapter 14 is a vision of this global battle that will bring history
to an end. God is going to bring all the nations to Jerusalem where
they will plunder the city, they will kill almost all of the
inhabitants and then at the last moment when things look the most
desperate, God will intervene and he'll fight for Israel and exact
revenge on her enemies. And it's after this final battle that God will
transform the earth into a paradise. So Israel's enemies will rage
against one another, the surviving nations will pilgrimage to
Jerusalem. Again, Jerusalem now is elevated above all cities, and these
nations will come to Jerusalem to worship Yahweh at his temple, and
Yahweh will be sovereign over the world.</p>

<p>Joel, a very short little book, probably the latest prophetic book,
also contains apocalyptic material. The versification of Joel varies
tremendously in different English translations, so I'm using the verse
markings that are in the Bible you have. But if you consult another
Bible some of them only have three chapters, some have four--it can be
confusing.</p>

<p>But we can divide Joel into two parts. Up to chapter 2, verse
27--that's the first part, from 1:1 to 2:27 (or 1:2 really). And that
contains a description of a military invasion. It's symbolized by an
army of locusts. And this invasion--this army of locusts--is
interpreted as a divine punishment that is necessary or that must come
before the day of the Lord. The second part of Joel which begins in
verse 28 of chapter 2 [=3:1] is a fully apocalyptic description of the
final day of terror.</p>

<p>Reading from chapter 3:3-4,</p>

<blockquote>Before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes,<br />
 I will set portents in the sky and on earth:<br />
Blood and fire, and pillars of smoke;<br />
 The sun shall be turned to darkness<br />
 And the moon to blood.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Before the great and terrible Day of the Lord comes--but the
righteous are going to survive. This is pointed out in chapter 3:5,
"But everyone who invokes the name of the Lord shall escape; for there
shall be a remnant on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, as the Lord
promised." As we move into chapter 4 of Joel, the Day of the Lord is
envisaged as a judgment day for all peoples. So this is increasingly
the view of the eschaton: a final battle and also a judgment day, and
that judgment day will then issue in a new age. This is an idea that
the book of Daniel will elaborate on in a minute, not to mention the
apocalyptic writings that are outside of the Hebrew Bible.</p>

<p>In this judgment day, God will summon all of the godless nations to
the valley of judgment, Jehosaphat which means "God will judge", so the
Valley of Jehosaphat. And here the final battle between good and evil
will take place, and after that God's people will be blessed and the
Holy City will never again suffer shame. [4:1-2]:</p>

<blockquote>For lo! in those days<br />
And in that time,<br />
When I restore the fortunes<br />
Of Judah and Jerusalem,<br />
I will gather all the nations<br />
And bring them down to the Valley of Jehosaphat,<br />
There I will contend with them<br />
Over My very own people, Israel,<br />
Which they scattered among the nations.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Towards the end, then, of the book we read,</p>

<blockquote>Let the nations rouse themselves and march up<br />
To the Valley of Jehosaphat;<br />
For there I will sit in judgment<br />
Over all the nations roundabout.<br />
Swing the sickle,<br />
For the crop is ripe;<br />
Come and tread,<br />
For the winepress is full,<br />
The vats are overflowing!<br />
For great is their wickedness.<br />
â€¦<br />
But the Lord will be a shelter to His people,<br />
A refuge to the children of Israel.<br />
â€¦<br />
And Jerusalem shall be holy;<br />
Nevermore shall strangers pass through it.<br />
And in that day,<br />
The mountains shall drip with wine,<br />
The hills shall flow with milk,<br />
And all the watercourses of Judah shall flow with water;<br />
A spring shall issue from the House of the Lord<br />
And shall water the Wadi of Acacias.<br />
â€¦<br />
But Judah shall be inhabited forever,<br />
And Jerusalem throughout the ages.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So we see a lot of eschatological features in the Book of Joel. You
have, first of all, the series of disasters; they signal the impending
wrath of God. You have a cosmic battle in which Yahweh triumphs over
Israel's enemy. And we see in apocalyptic literature in general, a
facile equation of the righteous and the wicked with Israel and other
nations. Then also we have this outpouring of blessings on God's
people, city, and land. And finally, God's continued protection and
presence; and nations who are not Israel's enemies join in the worship
of God in that final time.</p>

<p>Again, note the important difference between classical prophecy and
the apocalyptic literature. Both of them speak about final things; both
of them speak about an end-time. But the classical prophets did not in
general expect that the course of human affairs would come to an end.
Only that Israel's rebellion would end or that Israel would live under
a perfect king anointed by God. In the apocalyptic imagination history
itself is a closed process; it will end, and then a new age, a new
world order would begin. And the present age and the new age are
qualitatively distinct. The present age is under the dominion of evil
powers. We see it particularly in the apocalyptic writings outside of
the Bible and in the New Testament. That power that has dominion over
the present age is Satan. Satan is the arch enemy of God. The age to
come will be free of all evil, moral corruption, and death; Satan will
be defeated. But God himself is the one who has to do this. God must
intervene to bring the present age to a crashing halt and initiate this
new world order.</p>

<p>So let's turn now to Daniel for a full apocalyptic work. Daniel also
can be divided really into two parts and the first six chapters have
often been described as heroic fiction. They're a bit like the book of
Esther that we'll be talking about on Wednesday. Just a good story.
(Esther particularly has a lot or irony and is very, very funny.) But
like the book of Esther, Daniel features a Jew who lives in a Gentile
court and he's saved from disaster. I've listed the kings who are
discussed in the Book of Daniel. These chapters tell of Daniel's
adventures under two Babylonian kings, Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar;
the <i>text</i> says two Babylonian kings, Nebuchadnezzar and
Belshazzar; a Median king Darius who happens to be unknown to history,
a Persian king Cyrus--that's a whole lot of years!</p>

<p>The historical inaccuracy of the work, right? You have the
chronology of more than a century being telescoped here! There're other
inaccuracies. Belshazzar was actually never a king; he was sort of a
prince regent. He was defeated by Cyrus, not by Darius, so there are
tremendous historical inaccuracies and this is a sign that this was
written at a much later time, looking back when the history of a period
300 years ago was very confused. There's no clear historical knowledge
of the Babylonian and Persian period. So the book, we know, was written
quite late, perhaps the end of the third century, those first six
chapters.</p>

<p>We have a better idea about the remainder of the book. Chapters 7
through 12 are fully apocalyptic in genre and they were composed
between 167 and 164--I don't know if I wrote that up there, yeah, 167
and 164 BCE. This was a time when Jews were suffering intense
persecution at the hands of the Seleucid King of Syria, Antiochus
Epiphanes, Antiochus IV. And so Daniel is the latest book of the Hebrew
Bible.</p>

<p>It was chronologically the latest book, written between 167 and 164
BCE. But the author writes in code. He writes in code so that some
hostile person would not be able to understand. The author disguises
his references to contemporary historical events and personalities in
these visions, these symbolic visions that are attributed to a remote
era of the past.</p>

<p>Let's go back and look at the contents of these two sections. In
chapters 1 through 6, Daniel is represented as a loyal Jew who's living
in the exile in Babylonia, sixth-century exilic period among idol
worshippers. He refuses to bow down to any other god. He observes the
dietary laws and he prays facing Jerusalem. He seems to occupy a
position of some honor in the court. He has the power to interpret
dreams and to predict the future, and although he's severely tested he
remains true to Yahweh and Yahweh aids him in more than one miraculous
escape from danger. The main themes of this first section of the book
of Daniel are Daniel's interpretations of the dreams of these kings
(Nebuchadnezzar) and his allegiance to his God.</p>

<p>In chapter 2, Nebuchadnezzar has a dream of a huge statute. It has a
head of gold, has a torso and arms of silver, the belly and the thighs
are of bronze, the legs are of iron, and the feet are of mixed iron and
clay. I've kind of given you a little grid and in a minute we're going
to have another symbolic dream that's going to use animals to represent
the same things that are being represented here by the metals.</p>

<p>So you have this statue with these metals and iron and clay feet.
Then a great stone that's uncut by human hands flies from heaven and
smashes the clay feet of the statue, and the statue crumbles and this
stone becomes a mountain that fills all the earth. Daniel decodes the
dream's symbolism; and it's a historical symbolism, the march of
history. Each metal represents a kingdom that ruled the Ancient Near
East. Daniel only explicitly mentions gold as Babylon, but we can
figure out the rest. Silver is Media, bronze is Persia, and iron is
Alexander's Greece, right, Macedonian Greece that conquered the Ancient
Near East in the 330's, and brought Hellenism, and introduced the
Hellenistic period into Ancient Near Eastern history.</p>

<p>After Alexander's death, his empire was divided into smaller
Hellenistic kingdoms. The ones of greatest relevance to us are
Ptolemaic Egypt and Seleucid Syria because as you can imagine Palestine
is caught between those two great powers. So it's going to be fought
over by those two great powers.</p>

<p>So you have Egypt ruled by the Ptolemies; you have Syria ruled by
the Seleucids; they're wrangling for control of the land of Israel
that's lying between them. So the iron and clay feet of the statue in
Daniel's dream represent these lesser Hellenistic kingdoms of Egypt and
Syria that succeeded Alexander's empire and are a mix of Hellenistic
and Eastern elements. The stone from heaven represents the future
kingdom of God. It's going to come and destroy these godless kingdoms
and fill all of the earth forever.</p>

<p>Chapter 3 tells the story of Daniel's three companions who refuse to
worship a giant gold statue and they get themselves thrown into a fiery
furnace. When they emerge unscathed the king is greatly impressed and
so he acknowledges the God of Israel.</p>

<p>In chapter 4 there's a second dream. It's interpreted by Daniel as a
sign that Nebuchadnezzar will be struck down seven times. He's going to
lose his reason, he's going to lose his throne, until he realizes that
God is the source of all divine and human power. When this in fact
comes to pass--Nebuchadnezzar seems to suffer a fit of insanity that
drives him from society--the king then praises the God most high as the
universal king.</p>

<p>In chapter 5, Daniel's enemies at court trick the Median king (now
Darius, so we're moving to different kings). They trick him into
issuing an edict against those who pray to anyone but the king. This is
a problem for Daniel. Daniel violates the edict, of course, and he's
arrested and he's thrown into a den of lions. But he emerges unharmed,
and the result is, again, that the foreign king, in this case Darius
now, recognizes the supremacy of Yahweh and orders all in his kingdom
to revere the Jewish God.</p>

<p>There is, of course, no historical merit to these stories of
Babylonian and Persian kings acknowledging or adopting the God of the
Jews who lived in exile among them. These stories seem to give voice to
the hope or the fantasy that a cruel and impious monarch might be
taught humility by Yahweh. They also provide a model for life in the
Diaspora. Jews can live in the Gentile world but they must never forget
God and his laws.</p>

<p>Then we move into the second half of the Book of Daniel, chapters 7
to 12. As we move into this part of Daniel we switch from the third
person into the first person, so Daniel 7 to 12 is written in the first
person and it's fully apocalyptic. Here Daniel has a series of visions
and dreams that are interpreted for him by an angel, and again, that's
a classic feature of the apocalyptic genre. And these visions, again,
survey Ancient Near Eastern history from the sixth to the second
centuries.</p>

<p>Chapter 7 again represents the succession of kingdoms, the
Babylonian, the Median, the Persian, the Macedonian Empires, but this
time as beasts. So you have a lion, a bear, a winged leopard and an
ogre. The ogre has horns and the horns of this ogre then represent
these two lesser Hellenistic kingdoms, the Ptolemies of Egypt and the
Seleucids of Syria. The boastful little horn is the Syrian king,
Antiochus Epiphanies, himself.</p>

<p>In a second vision, the "ancient of days,"--this is the term that's
used, it seems to be God in a white robe and a beard seated on a fiery
chariot throne, but--"the ancient of days" confers glory and kingship
on one like a Son of Man.</p>

<p>Now in Daniel, this phrase, the Son of Man--which generally means
mortal as opposed to divine in the Bible, but--in Daniel the phrase
seems to refer to a figure that's in human form, but more than a human.
Probably an angel like Michael or Gabriel. (Both of them are
represented as leaders against the forces of Persia and Greece.) And
this figure establishes an everlasting kingdom to replace the bestial
kingdoms that have preceded it.</p>

<p>So the Son of Man overwhelms the little horn Antiochus, who is said
to be making war on saints (that's a code for loyal Jews), who is said
to have been trying to change their law and abolish their religion--and
we know that these were parts of the persecution in 167 to 164 by
Antiochus. He tried to stop worship in the sanctuary and so on.</p>

<p>In a third vision then, the horn that represents Antiochus is said
to trample the land of splendor (Israel), to challenge the army of
heaven, to remove the perpetual sacrifice (Antiochus did halt the
sacrificial service in the temple) and to set up an "abomination of
desolation" on the sacrificial altar (and we know that Antiochus set up
some kind of pagan altar on the sacrificial altar in the temple in
Jerusalem and erected a statue of Zeus in the sanctuary). So this
depiction of the persecution under Antiochus is presented here, but
it's presented in veiled form for reasons of safety.</p>

<p>In chapter 9 we have a moving prayer for deliverance. The Angel
Gabriel assures Daniel that the end is near, and that the end was even
predicted by Jeremiah who had said that Jerusalem would lie desolate
70years, you will recall.</p>

<p>Now, Jeremiah prophesied--I'm going to do some math now, so this is
dangerous. Jeremiah prophesied in the early sixth century and the
chapters of Daniel were written many centuries later, someone can
figure it out, in the 160's. So was Jeremiah prophesying falsely when
he said that God would deliver Israel from her enemies and establish a
kingdom in Judah in 70 years? No, not according to the book of Daniel,
because in the book of Daniel it's said that Jeremiah also was speaking
in a code. Jeremiah meant that 70 weeks of years, which is to say 490
years, would pass before the consummation of all things. And the last
week was the reign Antiochus Epiphanes: we are in the last week of
these years now.</p>

<p>So the writer is maintaining that he is living in the last days, in
the final moments of the last week of years, and this is very typical
of apocalyptic literature. The time is at hand, we are in the final
stage, this is now all the birth pangs of the Messiah, these terrible
things that are being visited upon us, and God is soon going to win
victory through a mighty act and introduce the Messianic Age, ending
Israel's long years of desolation.</p>

<p>So apocalyptic literature sees history as determined. It's a closed
drama that must be played out, requiring no action on the part of
humans except faithful waiting. God's kingdom will come solely by God's
power, but it has to be preceded by this time of trouble. These
troubles are nothing but the birth pangs of the Messianic Age and the
faithful whose names are recorded in God's book will be rescued.</p>

<p>Chapter 12 imagines a resurrection of the dead as a compensation to
those who died under the persecutions of Antiochus. It's a clear
attempt to deal with the injustice that mars this world, and it's the
only passage of the Bible to explicitly espouse the idea of an
individual life after death, and as I say, breaks with a longer
Israelite tradition that's vague or silent on this issue.</p>

<p>Not all Jews accepted the idea, but it would be essential to the
rise of Christianity which is deeply indebted to apocalyptic thinking.
And through Christianity, it came to have a very far-reaching impact on
Western civilization.</p>

<p>The Book of Daniel is a response to specific historical
circumstances. It's a response to the crisis of persecution and
martyrdom that was going on in the second century. That was a new kind
of crisis that led to a new kind of response, because the earlier
crises of 722 and 586--they could be explained as punishment for sin
and faithlessness. But now in the second century, Jews were dying not
because they were faithless but precisely because they were
<i>faithful</i>; because they refused to obey the decrees of Antiochus
and to violate their law and covenant and <i>they</i> were dying. So
this new phenomenon of martyrdom, really for the first time, required
new responses and the book of Daniel provides a fully apocalyptic
response. Remain faithful, wait, Daniel urges, know that this will all
be set right by God, not in this world but in an ultimate and
cataclysmic triumph of life and faith over death and evil, and it will
be soon.</p>

<p>Daniel emphasizes God's firm control of history and so bolsters
loyal Jews who are suffering indignities and torture and even death all
around him because of their faith.</p>

<p>So we've seen the zealous fifth-century response of Ezra and
Nehemiah to the fateful events of Israel's history. They believed
Israel's rededication to God and the covenant involved as a first step,
cessation of intimate relations with foreigners, separation from their
abominable practices. We've seen very different views that would
integrate foreigners in the worship of Yahweh. We've seen also the
later emergence of apocalyptic as an expression of present despair and
future hope that entailed the divinely orchestrated and cataclysmic
defeat of the wicked enemies who persecuted Israel. And in the last
lecture we're going to look at two books of the Hebrew Bible that take
very different approaches, the Book of Esther and the Book of
Jonah.</p>
