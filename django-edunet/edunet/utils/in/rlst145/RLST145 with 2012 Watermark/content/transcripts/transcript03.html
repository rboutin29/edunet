<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> Today what I'd like to do is begin
our survey of Genesis 1 through 11, in order to illustrate the way that
biblical writers--and precisely who we think they were and when they
lived is something we'll talk about later--but the way biblical writers
drew upon the cultural and religious legacy of the Ancient Near East
that we've been talking about, its stories and its imagery, even as
they transformed it in order to conform to a new vision of a
non-mythological god. We're going to be looking at some of Kaufman's
ideas as we read some of these texts.</p>

<p>Now one of the scholars who's written quite extensively and
eloquently on the adaptation of Ancient Near Eastern motifs in biblical
literature is a scholar by the name of Nahum Sarna: I highly recommend
his book. It appears on your optional reading list, and I'll be drawing
very heavily on Sarna's work as well as the work of some other scholars
who have spent a great deal of time comparing Israelite and Ancient
Near Eastern stories, particularly these opening chapters, in order to
see the features that they share and to wonder if perhaps there isn't
after all a chasm that divides them quite deeply.</p>

<p>In our consideration of Genesis 1 and 2, we first need to consider a
Babylonian epic, an epic that is known by its opening words at the top
of the column over there, <i>Enuma Elish</i>, which means "when on
high," the opening words of this epic. And the epic opens before the
formation of heaven and earth. Nothing existed except water, and water
existed in two forms. There's the primeval fresh water, fresh water
ocean, which is identified with a male divine principle, a male god
Apsu. You have a primeval salt water ocean which is identified with a
female divine principle, Tiamat. Tiamat appears as this watery ocean
but also as a very fierce dragon-like monster. I will be reading
sections from Speiser's translation of <i>Enuma Elish</i>, part of the
anthology put together by Pritchard [Pritchard 1950, 1955, 60-61]. It
begins:</p>

<blockquote>When on high the heaven had not been named,<br />
 Firm ground below had not been called by name,<br />
 Naught but primordial Apsu, their begetter,<br />
 [And] Mummu-Tiamat, she who bore them all,<br />
 Their waters co-mingling as a single body;<br />
 No reed hut had been matted, no marsh land had appeared,<br />
 When no gods whatever had been brought into being,<br />
 Uncalled by name, their destinies undetermined--;<br />
 Then it was that the gods were formed within them.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>So there's some sort of co-mingling or union of these male and
female divine principals, a sexual union of Apsu and Tiamat that begins
a process of generation and it produces first demons and monsters.
Eventually gods will begin to emerge. Now, in time, Tiamat and Apsu are
disturbed by the din and the tumult of these younger gods.</p>

<blockquote>The divine brothers banded together,<br />
 They disturbed Tiamat as they surged back and forth,<br />
 Yea, they troubled the mood of Tiamat<br />
 By their hilarity in the Abode of Heaven.<br />
 …<br />
 Apsu, opening his mouth,<br />
 Said unto resplendent Tiamat:<br />
 "Their ways are verily loathsome unto me.<br />
 By day I find no relief, nor repose by night.<br />
 I will destroy, I will wreck their ways,<br />
 That quiet may be restored. Let us have rest."<br />
 …<br />
 Then answered Mummu, [Mummu Tiamat] giving counsel to Apsu;<br />
 [Ill-wishing] and ungracious was Mummu's advice:<br />
 "Do destroy, my father, the mutinous ways.<br />
 Then shalt thou have relief by day and rest by night."<br />
 When Apsu heard this, his face grew radiant<br />
 Because of the evil he planned against the gods, his
sons.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>So he decides to destroy the gods and he is thwarted by a water god
named Ea, an earth-water god--sorry, he's a combination earth-water
god--named Ea. And Apsu is killed. Tiamat now is enraged and she's bent
on revenge. She makes plans to attack all of the gods with her
assembled forces. The gods are terrified and they need a leader to lead
them against her army and they turn to Marduk.</p>

<p>Marduk agrees to lead them in battle against Tiamat and her
assembled forces, her forces are under the generalship of Kingu, and he
agrees to lead them against Tiamat and Kingu on condition that he be
granted sovereignty, and he sets terms.</p>

<blockquote>His heart exulting, he said to his father:<br />
 "Creator of the gods, destiny of the great gods,<br />
 If I indeed, as your avenger,<br />
 Am to vanquish Tiamat and save your lives,<br />
 Set up the Assembly, proclaim supreme my destiny!<br />
 …Let my word, instead of you, determine the fates.<br />
 Unalterable shall be what I may bring into being,<br />
 Neither recalled nor changed shall be the command of my
lips."</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>And the agreement is struck. And Marduk fells Tiamat in battle. It's
a fierce battle and there is in fact a memorable passage that details
her demise.</p>

<blockquote>In fury, Tiamat cried out aloud,<br />
 To the roots her legs shook both together.<br />
 …Then joined issue, Tiamat and Marduk…,<br />
 They strove in single combat, locked in battle.<br />
 The lord [Marduk] spread out his net to enfold her,<br />
 The Evil Wind, which followed behind, he let loose in her face.<br />
 When Tiamat opened her mouth to consume him.<br />
 He drove in the Evil Wind that she close not her lips.<br />
 As the fierce winds charged her belly,<br />
 Her body was distended and her mouth was wide open.<br />
 He released the arrow, it tore her belly,<br />
 It cut through her insides, splitting the heart.<br />
 Having thus subdued her, he extinguished her life.<br />
 He cast down her carcass to stand upon it.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Well, what do you do with the carcass of a ferocious monster? You
build a world, and that's what Marduk did. He takes the carcass, he
slices it into two halves, rather like a clamshell, and out of the top
half he creates the firmament, the Heaven. With the other half he
creates the land, the Earth.</p>

<blockquote>He split her like a shellfish into two parts.<br />
 Half of her he set up and ceiled it as sky,<br />
 Pulled down the bar and posted guards.<br />
 He bade them to allow not her waters to escape.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Alright, so he has used her body to press back her waters and that's
what the ceiling is, the firmament, a firm sheet or structure that's
holding back waters. When little holes come along, that's rain coming
through. And the bottom part is the land, which is pressing down waters
below. They come up every now and then in springs and rivers and seas
and lakes and things.</p>

<p>That is the created world, but he doesn't stop there and he creates
various heavenly bodies at this point. "He constructed stations for the
great gods"--the heavenly bodies were understood as stations for the
great gods--</p>

<blockquote>Fixing their astral likenesses as constellations.<br />
 He determined the year by designating the zones;<br />
 He set up three constellations for each of the twelve months.<br />
 …<br />
The moon he caused to shine, the night to him entrusting.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>And then the complaints begin to roll in. The gods are very unhappy
because they have now been assigned specific duties in the maintenance
of the cosmos. The moon god has to come up at night and hang around for
a while and go back down. And the sun has to trundle across the sky,
and they're pretty unhappy about this and they want relief from working
and laboring at their assigned stations, and so Marduk accedes to this
demand.</p>

<p>He takes blood from the slain General Kingu, the leader of Tiamat's
army, the rebels, and he fashions a human being with the express
purpose of freeing the gods from menial labor.</p>

<blockquote>Blood I will mass and cause bones to be.<br />
 I will establish a savage, "man" shall be his name,<br />
 Verily, savage man I will create.<br />
 He shall be charged with the service of the gods<br />
 That they might be at ease.<br />
 …<br />
 "It was Kingu who contrived the uprising,<br />
 And made Tiamat rebel, and joined battle."<br />
[So] They bound him, holding him before Ea.<br />
 …[And] Out of [Kingu's] blood they fashioned mankind<br />
 [And] Ea imposed the service and let free the gods.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>So the grateful gods now recognize the sovereignty of Marduk and
they build him a magnificent shrine or temple in Babylon, pronounced
"Bab-el" which simply means gateway of the god, the gate of the god.
Babylon means the city that is the gateway of the god. And a big
banquet follows and Marduk is praised for all that he's accomplished,
and his kingship is confirmed and <i>Enuma Elish</i> ends.</p>

<p>It was the great national epic of the city of Babel or Babylon. It
was recited during the New Year festival, which was the most important
festival on the cultic calendar, and Nahum Sarna points out that it had
four main functions which I've listed over here [on the blackboard].
The first of those functions is theogonic. It tells us the story of the
birth of the gods, where they came from. Its second function is
cosmological. It's explaining cosmic phenomena: the land, the sky, the
heavenly bodies and so on, and their origins. It also serves a social
and political function, because the portrait or picture of the universe
or the world and its structure corresponds to and legitimates the
structure of Babylonian society. The position and the function of the
humans in the scheme of creation corresponds [to] or parallels
precisely the position of slaves in Mesopotamian society. The position
and function of Marduk at the top of the hierarchy of authority
parallels and legitimates the Babylonian King , with others arranged
within the pyramid that falls below.</p>

<p>The epic also explains and mirrors the rise of Babel as one of the
great cities in the Ancient Near East. It explains its rise to power,
and Marduk's rise from being a city god to being at the head of the
pantheon of a large empire. This also had a cultic function as well.
According to Sarna and some other scholars, the conflict, that battle
scene between Tiamat and Marduk which is described at some length,
symbolizes the conflict or the battle between the forces of chaos and
the forces of cosmos or cosmic order. And that's a perpetual conflict.
Each year it's dramatized by the cycle of the seasons, and at a certain
time of the year it seems that the forces of darkness and chaos are
prevailing but each spring, once again, cosmic order and life return.
So the epic served as a kind of script for the re-enactment of the
primeval battle in a cultic or temple setting, and that re-enactment
helped to ensure the victory of the forces of cosmos and life each year
over the forces of chaos and death.</p>

<p>So if we recall now, some of the things we were talking about last
time and the theories of Kaufman, we might describe the worldview
that's expressed by <i>Enuma Elish</i> in the following way, and this
is certainly what Sarna does. We're going to consider first of all the
view of the gods, the view of humans, and the view of the world: three
distinct categories. First of all the gods. The gods are clearly
limited. A god can make a plan and they're thwarted by another god who
then murders that god. They are amoral, some of them are nicer and
better than others but they're not <i>necessarily</i> morally good or
righteous. They emerge from this indifferent primal realm, this mixture
of salt and sea waters, that is the source of all being and the source
of ultimate power, but they age and they mature and they fight and they
die. They're not wholly good, not wholly evil, and no one god's will is
absolute.</p>

<p>The portrait of humans that emerges is that humans are unimportant
menials. They are the slaves of the gods, the gods have little
reciprocal interest in or concern for them, and they create human
beings to do the work of running the world. To some degree, they look
upon them as slaves or pawns.</p>

<p>The picture of the world that would seem to emerge from this story
is that it is a morally neutral place. That means that for humans it
can be a difficult and hostile place. The best bet perhaps is to serve
the god of the day--whatever god might be ascendant--to earn his favor
and perhaps his protection, but even that god will have limited powers
and abilities and may in fact be defeated or may turn on his
devotees.</p>

<p>Now if we turn to the creation story, the first of the two creation
stories that are in the Bible, because in fact there are two creation
stories with quite a few contradictions between them, but if we turn to
the first creation story in Genesis 1 which concludes in Genesis
2:4…and, not for nothing, but everyone understands the function of the
colon, right? So if you say Genesis 1:1, I mean chapter one, verse one.
And then it goes to Genesis 2 chapter two, verse 4; left side of the
colon is chapter, right side of the colon is verse, and every sentence
has a verse number in the Bible; approximately [each] sentence.</p>

<p>If we look now, we'll see a different picture emerging. The biblical
god in this story, which I hope you have read, is presented as being
supreme and unlimited. That's connected with the lack of mythology in
Genesis 1 or rather the suppression of mythology. Okay, there's a
distinction between the two and we'll have to talk about that, and I
hope that you'll get into some of that in section as well. I'm using
the term mythology now the way we used it in the last lecture when we
were talking about Kaufman's work. Mythology is used to describe
stories that deal with the birth, the life events of gods and
demi-gods, sometimes legendary heroes, but narrating a sequence of
events. The biblical creation account is non-mythological because there
is no biography of God in here. God simply is. There's no theogony, no
account of his birth. There's no story by means of which he emerges
from some other realm. In the Mesopotamian account, the gods themselves
are created and they're not even created first, actually; the first
generation of beings creates these odd demons and monsters, and gods
only are created after several generations and the god of creation,
Marduk, is actually kind of a latecomer in the picture.</p>

<p>And this is also a good time for us to draw a distinction between
mythology and myth. Kaufman and others have claimed that mythology is
not in, certainly, this biblical story or if it's not there it's at
least suppressed. But in contrast, myth is not mythology. Myth is a
term we use to refer to a traditional story. It's often fanciful, it
relates imaginatively events which it claims happened in historical
time, not in a primordial realm before time, and a myth is designed to
explain some kind of practice or ritual or custom or natural
phenomenon. "And that is why to this day," you know, "there…", I don't
know, give me some myth that we all know of, you know, Paul Bunyan's
axe handle is <i>something</i> in American nature which I now no longer
remember! But myths are fanciful, imaginative tales that are trying to
explain the existence of either a thing or a practice or even a
belief…sometimes it's a story that's a veiled explanation of a truth,
we think of parables, perhaps, or allegories. And so the claim that's
often made is that the Bible doesn't have full-blown mythology. It
doesn't focus on stories about the lives and deaths and interactions of
gods, but it does certainly contain myths. It has traditional stories
and legends, some quite fanciful, whose goal it is to explain how and
why something is what it is.</p>

<p>So returning to Genesis 1, we have an absence of theogony and
mythology in the sense of a biography of God in this opening chapter
and that means the absence of a metadivine realm. If you remember
nothing else from this course and certainly for the mid-term exam, you
should remember the words "metadivine realm." There's a little hint for
you there. It's an important concept. You don't have to buy into it,
you just have to know it, okay. But there is an absence of what Kaufman
would call this metadivine realm, this primordial realm from which the
gods emerge. We also, therefore, have no sense that God is imminent in
nature or tied to natural substances or phenomena. So, the biblical
god's powers and knowledge do not appear to be limited by the prior
existence of any other substance or power. Nature also is not divine.
It's demythologized, de-divinized, if that's a word; the created world
is not divine, it is not the physical manifestation of various deities,
an earth god, a water god and so on. The line of demarcation therefore
between the divine and the natural and human worlds would appear to be
clear. So, to summarize, in Genesis 1, the view of god is that there is
one supreme god, who is creator and sovereign of the world, who simply
exists, who appears to be incorporeal, and for whom the realm of nature
is separate and subservient. He has no life story, no mythology, and
his will is absolute.</p>

<p>Indeed, creation takes place through the simple expression of his
will. "When God began to create heaven and earth," and there's a
parenthetical clause: "God said, 'Let there be light' and there was
light." He expressed his will that there be light, and there was light
and that's very different from many Ancient Near Eastern cosmogonies in
which there's always a sexual principal at work in creation. Creation
is always the result of procreation in some way, male and female
principles combining. There's a very similar Egyptian creation story
actually in which the god Ptah just wills "let this be." It reads very
much like Genesis 1 and yet even so there's still a sexual act that
follows the expression of those wills, so it is still different.</p>

<p>Consider now the portrait of humans, humankind, that emerges from
the biblical creation story in contrast to <i>Enuma Elish</i>. In
Genesis, humans are important; in Genesis 1 humans are important. And
in fact the biblical view of humans really emerges from both of the
creation stories, when they're read together--the story here in Genesis
1 and then the creation story that occupies much of 2 and 3. The two
accounts are extremely different but they both signal the unique
position and dignity of the human being. In the first account in
Genesis 1, the creation of the human is clearly the climactic divine
act: after this God can rest. And a sign of the humans' importance is
the fact that humans are said to be created in the image of God, and
this occurs in Genesis 1:26, "Let us make man in our image, after our
likeness." What might that mean? Looking at the continuation of the
verse, of the passage, we have some idea because humans, we see, are
going to be charged with specific duties towards, and rights over, the
created world. And it seems, therefore, that the idea of being created
in the image of God is connected with those special rights and duties.
A creature is required who is distinguished in certain ways from other
animals. How are humans distinguished from other animals? You could
make a long list but it might include things like the capacity for
language and higher thought or abstract thought, conscience,
self-control, free-will. So, if those are the distinctive
characteristics that earn the human being certain rights over creation
but also give them duties towards creation, and the human is distinct
from animals in being created in the image of God, there's perhaps a
connection: to be godlike is to perhaps possess some of these
characteristics.</p>

<p>Now being created in the image of God carries a further implication.
It implies that human life is somehow sacred and deserving of special
care and protection. And that's why in Genesis 9:6 we read, "Whoever
sheds the blood of man, in exchange for that man shall his blood be
shed, for in the image of God was man created" [Hayes' translation].
[They] invoke that rationale from Genesis 1 in the absolute prohibition
on murder. There is no way to compensate or punish someone for murder,
it simply means forfeiture of one's own life. That's how sacred human
life is. That's the biblical view.</p>

<p>So, the concept of the divine image in humans--that's a powerful
idea, that there is a divine image in humans, and that breaks with
other ancient conceptions of the human. In Genesis 1, humans are not
the menials of God, and in fact Genesis expresses the antithesis of
this. Where in <i>Enuma Elish</i>, service was imposed upon humans so
the gods were free--they didn't have to worry about anything, the
humans would take care of the gods--we have the reverse; it's almost
like a polemical inversion in Genesis 1. The very first communication
of God to the human that's created is concern for that creature's
physical needs and welfare. He says in Genesis 1:28-29, he blesses
them, "God blessed them and God said to them, 'Be fertile and increase,
fill the earth and master it; and rule the fish of the sea, the birds
of the sky and all the living things that creep on earth.'" In Genesis
2:16 after the creation story there, "And the Lord God commanded the
man saying, 'Of every tree of the garden you are free to eat.'" His
first thought is what are you going to eat? I want you to be fruitful
and multiply, and so on.</p>

<p>So, humans in Genesis are not presented as the helpless victims of
blind forces of nature. They're not the menials and servants of
capricious gods. They are creatures of majesty and dignity and they are
of importance to, objects of concern for, the god who has created them.
At the same time, and I think very much in line with the assertion that
humans are created in the image of God, humans are not, in fact, gods.
They are still creatures in the sense of created things and they are
dependent on a higher power. So in the second creation story beginning
in Genesis 2:4, we read that the first human is formed when God
fashions it from the dust of the earth or clay. There are lots of
Ancient Near Eastern stories of gods fashioning humans from clay; we
have depictions of gods as potters at a potter's wheel just turning out
lots of little humans. But the biblical account as much as it borrows
from that motif again takes pains to distinguish and elevate the human.
First, the fashioning of the human from clay is--again--in that story,
it's the climactic or, well not quite climactic, it's the penultimate,
I suppose, moment in the story. The final climactic act of creation is
the creation of the female from the male. That is actually the peak of
creation, what can I say [laughter]? Second and significantly, not an
afterthought, it's the peak of creation! Second and significantly, God
himself blows the breath of life into Adam's nostrils. So while he
fashions this clay figure, this carcass actually--and then breathes
life, his own life into it. So, in the second creation story just as in
the first, there's a sacred imprint of some kind that distinguishes the
human creation from the other creatures. So this idea that the human
being is a mixture of clay, he's molded from clay, but enlivened by the
breath of God, captures that paradoxical mix of sort of earthly and
divine elements, dependence and freedom that marks the human as
unique.</p>

<p>It should further be noted that in the first creation account,
there's no implication that man and woman are in any kind of unequal
relationship before God. The Hebrew word that designates the creature
created by God is the word <i>adam</i>. It's actually not a proper
name, small a; it is <i>adam</i>, it's a generic term. It simply means
human or more precisely earthling because it comes from the word
<i>adamah</i>, which means ground or earth. So this is <i>adam</i>, an
earthling, a thing that has been taken from the earth. Genesis 1 states
that God created <i>the</i> <i>adam</i>, with the definite article:
this is not a proper name. God created the <i>adam</i>, the earthling,
"male and female created he them." That's a line that has vexed
commentators for centuries and has spawned many very fascinating
interpretations. And you will be reading some of those in the readings
that are assigned for section discussion next week and I think having a
great deal of fun with them. Moreover, this earthling that seems to
include both male and female, is then said to be in the image of God.
So that suggests that the ancient Israelites didn't conceive of God as
gendered or necessarily gendered. The <i>adam</i>, the earthling, male
and female was made in the image of God. Even in the second creation
account, it's not clear that the woman is subordinate to the man. Many
medieval Jewish commentators enjoy pointing out that she was not made
from his head so that she not rule over him, but she wasn't made from
his foot so that she would be subservient to him; she was made from his
side so that she would be a companion to him. And the creation of
woman, as I said, is in fact the climactic creative act in the second
Genesis account. With her formation, creation is now complete. So, the
biblical creation stories individually and jointly present a portrait
of the human as the pinnacle and purpose of creation: godlike in some
way, in possession of distinctive faculties and characteristics, that
equip them for stewardship over the world that God has created.</p>

<p>Finally, let's talk about the image of the world that emerges from
the creation story in Genesis 1. In these stories, there's a very
strong emphasis on the essential goodness of the world. Recall some of
Kaufman's ideas or categories again. One of the things he claims is
that in a polytheistic system, which is morally neutral, where you have
some primordial realm that spawns demons, monsters, gods, evil is a
permanent necessity. It's just built into the structure of the cosmos
because of the fact that all kinds of divine beings, good and bad, are
generated and locked in conflict. So the world isn't essentially good
in its nature or essentially bad. Note the difference in Genesis. After
each act of creation what does God say? "It is good," right? Genesis 1
verse 4, verse 10, verse 12, verse 18, verse 21, verse 25… and after
the creation of living things, the text states that God found all that
he made to be very good. So there are seven occurrences of the word
"good" in Genesis. That's something you want to watch for. If you're
reading a passage of the Bible and you're noticing a word coming up a
lot, count them. There's probably going to be seven or ten, they love
doing that. The sevenfold or the tenfold repetition of a word--such a
word is called a <i>leitwort</i>, a recurring word that becomes
thematic. That's a favorite literary technique of the biblical author.
So we read Genesis 1 and we hear this recurring--"and it was good… and
he looked and it was good… and he looked and it was good," and we have
this tremendous rush of optimism. The world is good; humans are
important; they have purpose and dignity.</p>

<p>The biblical writer is rejecting the concept of a primordial evil, a
concept found in the literature of the Ancient Near East. So for the
biblical writer of this story, it would seem that evil is not a
metaphysical reality built into the structure of the universe. So all
signs of a cosmic battle, or some primordial act of violence between
the forces of chaos and evil and the forces of cosmos and good are
eliminated. In <i>Enuma Elish</i>, cosmic order is achieved only after
a violent struggle with very hostile forces. But in Genesis, creation
is not the result of a struggle between divine antagonists. God imposes
order on the demythologized elements that he finds: water, but it's
just water. Let's look a little bit more closely at Genesis 1 to make
this case.</p>

<p>The chapter begins with a temporal clause which is unfortunately
often translated "In the beginning," which implies that what follows is
going to give you an ultimate account of the origins of the universe.
You sort of expect something like, "In the beginning, God created
heaven and earth," like this was the first thing to happen in time. So,
that translation causes people to believe that the story is giving me
an account of the first event in time forward; but it's actually a bad
translation. The Hebrew phrase that starts the book of Genesis is
pretty much exactly like the phrase that starts <i>Enuma Elish</i>:
"When on high," there was a whole bunch of water and stuff, then
suddenly this happened--very similar in the Hebrew. It's better
translated this way: "When God began creating the heavens and the
earth… he said, 'Let there be light and there was light.'" And that
translation suggests that the story isn't concerned to depict the
ultimate origins of the universe. It's interested in explaining how and
why the world got the way it is. When God began this process of
creating the heaven and the earth, and the earth was unformed and void,
and his wind was on the surface of the deep and so on, he said, "Let
there be light and there was light." So, we find that, in fact,
something exists; it has no shape. So creation in Genesis 1 is not
described as a process of making something out of nothing: that's a
notion referred to as creation <i>ex nihilo</i>, creation of something
out of utter nothing. It's instead a process of organizing pre-existing
materials and imposing order on those chaotic materials.</p>

<p>So we begin with this chaotic mass and then there's the <i>ruah</i>
of God. Now sometimes this word "ruah" is kind of anachronistically
translated as "spirit"; it really doesn't mean that in the Hebrew
Bible. In later levels of Hebrew it will start to mean that, but it is
really "wind," <i>ruah</i> is wind. So: "when God began to create
heaven and earth--the earth being unformed and void," the wind of God
sweeping over the deep. Remember the cosmic battle between Marduk and
Tiamat: Marduk the storm god, who released his wind against Tiamat, the
primeval deep, the primeval water, representing the forces of chaos.
And you should immediately hear the great similarities. Our story opens
with a temporal clause: "When on high," "when God began creating"; we
have a wind that sweeps over chaotic waters, just like the wind of
Marduk released into the face of Tiamat, and the Hebrew term is
particularly fascinating. In fact, the text says "and there is darkness
on the face of deep." No definite article. The word "deep" <i>is</i> a
proper name, perhaps. The Hebrew word is Tehom. It means "deep" and
etymologically it's exactly the same word as Tiamat: the "at" ending is
just feminine. So Tiam, Tehom--it's the same word, it's a related word.
So, the wind over the face of deep, now it's demythologized, so it's as
if they're invoking the story that would have been familiar and yet
changing it. So the storyteller has actually set the stage for
retelling the cosmic battle story that everyone knew. That was a story
that surely was near and dear to the hearts of many ancient Israelites
and Ancient Near Eastern listeners, so all the elements are there for
the retelling of that story. We've got wind, we've got a primeval
chaotic, watery mass or deep, and then surprise, there's no battle.
There's just a word, "let there be light." And the Ancient Near Eastern
listener would prick up their ears: where's the battle, where's the
violence, where's the gore? I thought I knew this story. So something
new, something different was being communicated in this story.</p>

<p>And don't think the biblical writers didn't know this motif of
creation following upon a huge cosmic battle, particularly a battle
with a watery, dragon-like monster. There are many poetic passages and
poetic sections of the Bible that contain very clear and explicit
illusions to that myth. It was certainly known and told to Israelite
children and part of the culture. We have it mentioned in Job; we have
it mentioned in the following psalm, Psalm 74:12-17: "O God, my king
from of old, who brings deliverance throughout the land;/it was You who
drove back the sea with Your might, who smashed the heads of the
monsters in the waters;/it was You who crushed the heads of Leviathan,"
a sea monster. Other psalms also contain similar lines. Isaiah 51:9-10:
"It was you that hacked Rahab"--this is another name of a primeval
water monster--"in pieces,/[It was you] That pierced the Dragon./It was
you that dried up the Sea,/The waters of the great deep." These were
familiar stories, they were known in Israel, they were recounted in
Israel. They were stories of a god who violently slays the forces of
chaos, represented as watery dragons, as a prelude to creation. And the
rejection of this motif or this idea in Genesis 1 is pointed and
purposeful. It's demythologization. It's removal of the creation
account from the realm and the world of mythology. It's pointed and
purposeful. It wants us to conceive of God as an uncontested god who
through the power of his word or will creates the cosmos.</p>

<p>And he follows that initial ordering by setting up celestial bodies,
just as Marduk did. They're not in themselves, however, divinities:
they are merely God's creations. In the biblical text, the firmament
appears to be a beaten, the word in Hebrew is something that's been
beaten out, like a metal worker would hammer out a thin sheet of metal.
And that's what the firmament [pointing at blackboard] this by the way
is the portrait of the world; it looks a lot like my map of the Ancient
Near East, but it's not. So you have this firmament, which is beaten
back to hold back primeval waters that are pressing in; you have land
which is holding down the waters here. We inhabit the bubble that's
created in that way. That's the image in <i>Enuma Elish</i> and it's
the image of Genesis 1. And later on when God gets mad he's going to
open up some windows up here, right, and it's all going to flood.
That's what's going to happen in the Flood. That's the image of the
world that you're working with. So, the firmament is sort of like an
inverted bowl, a beaten-out sheet of metal that's an inverted bowl, and
again as I said: echoes of <i>Enuma Elish</i>, where you have Marduk
dividing the carcass of Tiamat, like a shellfish. He separates the
waters above and the waters below and creates this space that will
become the inhabited world.</p>

<p>Now the story of creation in Genesis 1 takes place over seven days,
and there's a certain logic and parallelism to the six days of
creating. And I've written those parallels here [on the blackboard].
There's a parallel between day one, day four; day two and five; day
three and six. On day one, light and dark are separated. On day four,
the heavenly bodies that give off light by day or night are created. On
day two, the firmament is established. That water is separated, that
bubble has opened up so we've got the sky created and we've got the
waters collected in certain areas down here, and we've got sky. On day
five, the inhabitants of the skies and the waters are created, birds
and fish. On day three, land is formed to make dry spots from the
waters below. So you have land being formed on day three, it's
separated out from the sea and on day six you have the creation of land
animals. But days three and six each have an extra element, and the
fact that the first elements here pair up nicely with each other
suggests that the extra element on day three and the extra element on
day six might also be paired in some important way. On day three,
vegetation is produced, is created, and on day six humans are created
after the creation of the land animals. So the implication is that the
vegetation is for the humans. And indeed, it's expressly stated by God
that humans are to be given every fruit bearing tree and seed bearing
plant, fruits and grains for food. That's in Genesis 1:29. That's what
you are going to eat. There's no mention of chicken or beef, there's no
mention made of animals for food. In Genesis 1:30, God says that the
animals are being given the green plants, the grass and herbs, for
food. In other words, there should be no competition for food. Humans
have fruit and grain-bearing vegetation, animals have the herbiage and
the grasses. There is no excuse to live in anything but a peaceful
co-existence. Therefore, humans, according to Genesis 1, were created
vegetarian, and in every respect, the original creation is imagined as
free of bloodshed and violence of every kind. "And God saw… [that it
was] very good."</p>

<p>So on the seventh day, God rested from his labors and for this
reason he blessed the seventh day and declared it "holy." This is a
word we'll be coming back to in about five or six lectures, talking
about what it is to be holy, but right now it essentially means it
belongs to God. If something's holy, it doesn't belong to you, it
belongs to God. And part of the purpose of this story is to explain the
origin of the observance of the Sabbath, the seventh day, as a holy
day. So this is a myth in the sense that it's explaining some custom or
ritual among the people.</p>

<p>So Israelite accounts of creation contain clear allusions to and
resonances of Ancient Near Eastern cosmogonies; but perhaps Genesis 1
can best be described as demythologizing what was a common cultural
heritage. There's a clear tendency in this story towards monotheism in
the abstract terms that Kaufman described. A transformation of widely
known stories to express a monotheistic worldview is clearly important
to these particular biblical writers, and we'll be talking later about
who these writers were who wrote Genesis 1 as opposed to Genesis 2 and
3. But these stories rival, and implicitly polemicize against, the
myths or mythologies of Israel's neighbors. They reject certain
elements but they almost reject them by incorporating them. They
incorporate and modify them.</p>

<p>So, one of the things I've tried to claim in describing Genesis 1 is
that in this story evil is represented not as a physical reality. It's
not built into the structure of the world. When God rests he's looking
at the whole thing, [and] it's very good, it's set up very well. And
yet we know that evil is a condition of human existence. It's a reality
of life, so how do we account for it? And the Garden of Eden story, I
think, seeks to answer that question. It actually does a whole bunch of
things, but one thing it does, I think, is try to answer that question,
and to assert that evil stems from human behavior. God created a good
world, but humans in the exercise of their moral autonomy, they have
the power to corrupt the good. So, the Garden of Eden story
communicates what Kaufman would identify as a basic idea of the
monotheistic worldview: that evil isn't a metaphysical reality, it's a
moral reality. What that means ultimately is that evil lacks
inevitability, depending on your theory of human nature, I suppose, and
it also means that evil lies within the realm of human responsibility
and control.</p>

<p>Now Nahum Sarna, the scholar whose work I referred to earlier, he
points out that there's a very important distinction between the Garden
of Eden story and its Ancient Near Eastern parallels. He says the motif
of a tree of life or a plant of life or a plant of eternal youth,
that's a motif that we do find in other Ancient Near Eastern
literatures, in Ancient Near Eastern myth and ritual and iconography,
and the quest for such a plant, or the quest for immortality that the
plant promises, that these were primary themes in the Mesopotamian Epic
of Gilgamesh. We'll have occasion to talk in great depth about this
story next time. But by contrast, Sarna says, we haven't as yet
uncovered a parallel in Ancient Near Eastern literature to the biblical
tree of the knowledge of good and evil. It's not the tree of knowledge,
it's the tree of the knowledge of good and evil--it's a longer phrase.
What is the significance of the fact that the Bible mentions both of
these trees? It mentions a tree of life and the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil; and then goes on to just focus on the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil. It virtually ignores the tree of life until
we get to the end of the story, and that's important. But this tree of
life which seems to be central to many other myths of this time and
this part of the world… Sarna argues that the subordinate role of the
tree of life signals the biblical writer's dissociation from a
preoccupation with immortality. The biblical writer insists that the
central concern of life is not mortality but morality. And the drama of
human life should revolve not around the search for eternal life but
around the moral conflict and tension between a good god's design for
creation and the free will of human beings that can corrupt that good
design.</p>

<p>The serpent tells Eve that if she eats the fruit of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, she will become like God. And he's really
not telling a lie, in a certain respect. And God knows that, that human
beings will become like God knowing good and evil. It's one of the
things about God: he knows good and evil and has chosen the good. The
biblical writer asserts of this god that he is absolutely good. The
humans will become like gods, knowing good and evil, not because of
some magical property in this fruit; and it's not an apple, by the way,
that's based on an interesting mistranslation. Do we know what the
fruit is? No, I don't think we really know but it's definitely not an
apple. That comes from the Latin word which sounds like apple, the word
<i>malum</i> for evil is close to the Latin word for apple which if
anybody knows... whatever [see note 1]. And so iconography began to
represent this tree as an apple tree and so on, but it's not an apple
tree. I don't know if they had apple trees back then, there! But it's
not because of some magical property in the fruit itself, but because
of the action of disobedience itself. By choosing to eat of the fruit
in defiance of God--this is the one thing God says, "Don't do this! You
can have everything else in this garden," presumably, even, you can eat
of the tree of life, right? It doesn't say you can't eat of that. Who's
to say they couldn't eat of that and just live forever? Don't eat of
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> Is there any sort of an explanation for why God says
you can't eat of this tree when he's given all of the fruit bearing
trees...</p>

<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> There have been about--how many
thousands of years of speculation--on what's going on and you're going
to be reading a wonderful and interesting gnostic interpretation. And
so, yep, there's been lots of interesting… and this is all in the realm
of literary interpretation: read the story closely, see if you can
figure out what's going on here. Why does God do this? Isn't this, in a
way, putting an obstacle in front of someone almost ensuring they're
going to trip over it? That's been an argument that some commentators
have made. Others see it differently. So, keep that thought, take it to
section and read Elaine Pagels' work and some of the other
interpretations. That's something that people have struggled with for
centuries. Where does this come from? Who's the serpent and what's he
doing there? They're all very important.</p>

<p>It is true--and maybe this will go a little bit of the distance
towards answering it--it's by eating of the fruit in defiance of God,
human beings learn that they were able to do that, that they are free
moral agents. They find that out. They're able to choose their actions
in conformity with God's will or in defiance of God's will. So
paradoxically, they learn that they have moral autonomy. Remember, they
were made in the image of God and they learn that they have moral
autonomy by making the defiant choice, the choice for disobedience. The
argument could be made that until they once disobeyed, how would they
ever know that? And then you might raise all sorts of questions about,
well, was this part of God's plan that they ought to know this and
should know this, so that their choice for good actually becomes
meaningful. Is it meaningful to choose to do the good when you have no
choice to do otherwise or aren't aware that you have a choice to do
otherwise? So, there's a wonderful thirteenth-century commentator that
says that God needed creatures who could choose to obey him, and
therefore it was important for Adam and Eve to do what they did and to
learn that they had the choice not to obey God so that their choice for
God would become endowed with meaning. That's one line of
interpretation that's gone through many theological systems for
hundreds of years.</p>

<p>So the very action that brought them a godlike awareness of their
moral autonomy was an action that was taken in opposition to God. So we
see then that having knowledge of good and evil is no guarantee that
one will choose or incline towards the good. That's what the serpent
omitted in his speech. He said if you eat of that fruit, of the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil, you'll become like God. It's true in
one sense but it's false in another. He sort of omitted to point out…
he implies that it's the power of moral choice alone that is godlike.
But the biblical writer will claim in many places that true godliness
isn't simply power, the power to do what one wishes. True godliness
means imitation of God, the exercise of one's power in a manner that is
godlike, good, life-affirming and so on. So, it's the biblical writer's
contention that the god of Israel is not only all-powerful but is
essentially and necessarily good. Those two elements cannot become
disjoined, they must always be conjoined in the biblical writer's view.
And finally, humans will learn that the concomitant of their freedom is
responsibility. Their first act of defiance is punished harshly. So
they learn in this story that the moral choices and actions of humans
have consequences that have to be borne by the perpetrator.</p>

<p>So, just to sum up, Sarna sees in the Garden of Eden story, as I've
just explained it, a message that's in line with Kaufman's thesis about
the monotheistic world view. He says this story conveys the idea that,
"…evil is a product of human behavior, not a principal inherent in the
cosmos. Man's disobedience is the cause of the human predicament. Human
freedom can be at one and the same time an omen of disaster and a
challenge and opportunity" [Sarna 1966, 27-28]. We've looked at Genesis
2 and 3 a little bit as an attempt to account for the problematic and
paradoxical existence of evil and suffering in a world created by a
good god, and that's a problem monotheism really never completely
conquers, but other perspectives on this story are possible. And when
we come back on Monday, we're going to look at it from an entirely
different point of view and compare it with the Epic of Gilgamesh.</p>
