<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> An interesting counterpoint to the
apocalyptic literature and the apocalyptic reliance on God's
cataclysmic consummation of history in order to dole out justice to the
righteous and the wicked, is found in the Book of Esther. And this is a
short novella. It's set in fifth-century Persia, it was probably
written in the fourth century, we think, but it's set during the reign
of Xerxes (and there's no x in the Hebrew alphabet--this is Ahasuerus,
which is Xerxes), and he was a fifth-century Persian emperor from about
486 to 465.</p>

<p>It's another heroic fiction that features a Jew in the court of a
gentile king, so it's like Daniel. The Jews of Persia are threatened
with genocide, and they are saved not by divine intervention but
entirely through their own efforts. Indeed, the Book of Esther does not
mention God once.</p>

<p>The story revolves around Mordechai. Now, Mordechai is a pious Jew.
He sits at the gate of the Persian king, Ahasuerus or Xerxes, and his
beautiful niece is also central to the story of course--that's
Esther--and he has adopted her as his own. There's a lot of comic irony
in this story. It really is a fun read. Time is not going to permit me
to go into the various subplots and the dramatic reversals, the ironies
and twists, but I will just highlight a few of the most salient points
that are relevant to the conversation we've been having.</p>

<p>When the Persian king divorces his wife, Vashti, because she refuses
to appear in the royal diadem before his male courtiers--presumably in
nothing but the royal diadem--Esther's great beauty commends her to the
king and she becomes queen. Now, her uncle Mordechai advises her to be
discreet about her Jewish identity for safety's sake.</p>

<p>In 2:10 and 11 it says,</p>

<blockquote>Esther did not reveal her people or her kindred, for
Mordechai had told her not to reveal it. Every single day Mordechai
would walk about in front of the court of the harem, to learn how
Esther was faring and what was happening to her.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So, a little while later the king promotes a certain Haman, Haman
the Agagite, to the post of chief administrator. And everyone in the
palace gate kneels down to Haman as the king has ordered, everyone that
is except for Mordechai. Day after day he refuses, and finally the
matter is told to Haman. This is chapter 3:4-6, and "When they spoke to
him day after day and he would not listen to them," speaking to
Mordechai and he won't listen to them,</p>

<blockquote>…they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordechai's
resolve would prevail; for he had explained to them that he was a Jew.
When Haman saw that Mordechai would not kneel or bow low to him, Haman
was filled with rage. But he disdained to lay hands on Mordechai alone;
having been told who Mordechai's people were, Haman plotted to do away
with all the Jews, Mordechai's people, throughout the kingdom of
Ahasuerus.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So Haman casts lots. The word for lots is <i>purim</i>; so he casts
lots in order to determine the date of the massacre and then he offers
the king a handsome bribe in return for permission to kill the Jews of
the kingdom. This is chapter 3:8-11--and listen to the rationale that's
proposed. He says to the king:</p>

<blockquote>…"There is a certain people, scattered and dispersed among
the other peoples in all the provinces of your realm, whose laws are
different from those of any other people and who do not obey the king's
laws; and it is not in Your majesty's interest to tolerate them. If it
please Your Majesty, let an edict be drawn for their destruction, and I
will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the stewards for deposit in
the royal treasury." Thereupon the king removed his signet ring from
his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the
foe of the Jews. And the king said, "The money and the people are yours
to do with as you see fit."</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So he provides a rationale. He also provides a good bribe along with
it to get this edict. So this edict goes out to every province to
destroy, massacre, and exterminate all the Jews, young and old,
children and women, on a single day. This is to be the thirteenth of
the month of Adar. Jews everywhere begin to fast and weep and wail.
They mourn, they wear sackcloth and ashes. And Esther sends to
Mordechai for an explanation of the commotion. She's somewhat sealed
off here in the harem and doesn't quite know what's going on. So he
sends a message informing her of the decree. And he urges her to appeal
to the king and to plead for her people. And Esther hesitates, partly
because to appear unbidden before the king carries a penalty of death.
And Mordechai responds with this message. This is Esther 4:13b to
16:</p>

<blockquote>"Do not imagine that you, of all the Jews, will escape with
your life by being in the king's palace. On the contrary, if you keep
silent in this crisis, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews
from another quarter, while you and your father's house will perish.
And who knows, perhaps you have attained to royal position for just
such a crisis." Then Esther sent back this answer to Mordechai: "Go,
assemble all the Jews who live in Shushan," [in Susa, in Persia] "and
fast in my behalf; do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I
and my maidens will observe the same fast. Then I shall go to the king,
though it is contrary to the law, and if I am to perish, I shall
perish!"</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So Mordechai went about the city and did just as Esther had
commanded him. It's a very tense scene, Esther approaches the king and
he--you get a signal: he raises his scepter or not, to accept you or
not--and in this tense moment he permits her entry and he offers to
grant her every request.</p>

<p>And so she asks that the king and Haman attend a banquet that she's
preparing. And at Esther's banquet, the king offers to grant Esther any
request that she might wish to make. And so her request is stated in
the following terms, terms that show her loyalty to her people. Esther
7:3b-6:</p>

<blockquote>…"If Your Majesty will do me the favor, and if it pleases
Your Majesty, let my life be granted me as my wish and my people as my
request. For we have been sold, my people and I, to be destroyed,
massacred, and exterminated. Had we only been sold as bondmen and
bondwomen," [as slaves] "I would have kept silent; for the adversary is
not worth the king's trouble."<br />
 Thereupon King Ahasuerus demanded of Queen Esther, "Who is he and
where is he who dared to do this?" "The adversary and enemy," replied
Esther, "is this evil Haman!" And Haman cringed in terror before the
king and the queen.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So Esther boldly reveals her Jewish identity before the king. She
expresses her solidarity in her speech with phrases like "we" and "my
people and I." There's a real comedy of errors that follows. The king
leaves the room in a rage and Haman falls prostrate on Esther's couch
to beg for his life. So when the king reenters the room, he sees Haman
in this compromising position and he declares, "Does he mean to ravish
the queen in my own palace?" So he orders Haman to be impaled on the
very stake that Haman had set up for Mordechai, and Mordechai in fact
is then elevated in Haman's stead within the court.</p>

<p>But the Jews are still in danger because an edict of the king's
cannot be revoked. Once a word has gone forth from the king, it is law.
So the solution is a second edict in which Ahasuerus charges the Jews
to arm and defend themselves. And so then we have another of many
reversals in this story. What was to be a day of defeat and massacre of
the Jews becomes a day of triumph as the Jews who now have permission
to arm themselves and fight, slay those who were bent on murdering
them.</p>

<p>The victory celebration which is the festival of Purim is
commemorated by Jews to this day. The very melodramatic story of this
luxurious Persian court life and all of the attendant political
intrigue that goes on in this story, it's recreated in annual
<i>Purim</i> celebrations, very raucous, carnival-like dramatizations.
According to the Talmud on Purim, it's a <i>mitzvah</i>, which can mean
a commandment or a good deed, to get so drunk that you can't
distinguish between Mordechai and Haman.</p>

<p>But for all of that there are some very important and striking
themes in the story. First, there's the ethnic element of Jewish
identity, rather than religious, that comes to the fore in the book of
Esther. The presentation is secular, the Jews are described as a
people, an ethnos. Esther is fully assimilated to her gentile
environment. Unlike Daniel, who prays towards Jerusalem daily in the
court of the king and observes the dietary laws in the court of the
king, we hear nothing like this about Esther at all.</p>

<p>There's also a very human and very anti-apocalyptic message in this
story. It gives expression to the conviction that solidarity and heroic
resistance are necessary in the face of overwhelming anti-Jewish
aggression to ensure Jewish survival. This, according to the book of
Esther, so different from the book of Daniel, is the lesson to be
learned from Israel's history.</p>

<p>If the book of Esther presents one alternative to the post-exilic
eschatologies in which Yahweh's enemies are afflicted and consumed for
their wickedness, then the book of Jonah offers another
perspective.</p>

<p>The book of Jonah is actually found among the section of the Bible
called the Prophets--the second section, the prophetic books of the
Bible--and that's because in the book of Kings, 2 Kings 14:25, we have
someone identified as Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet. This is
considered the same Jonah, and so the book is considered to be among
the books of the Prophets.</p>

<p>But it differs in significant ways from the other prophetic books.
It is not, in fact, a collection of oracles. It's actually a story, a
somewhat comic story, a comic tale about a reluctant prophet named
Jonah. The second interesting or unusual thing about this book, is that
Jonah is commissioned by Yahweh to carry a message to the people of
Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, not to the people of Israel.</p>

<p>The Israelite concept of divine mercy receives its full expression
in the book of Jonah. In the first chapter, Jonah receives a call from
Yahweh who instructs him to go to Nineveh, whose wickedness is great,
and to proclaim God's judgment. Chapter 1, the first three verses: "The
word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai: Go at once to Nineveh,
that great city, and proclaim judgment upon it; for their wickedness
has come before Me. Jonah, however, started out to flee to Tarshish
from the Lord's service." [That's like saying he got up and went to
Timbuktu. Tarshish was the extent, the farthest extent of the known
world navigable through the Mediterranean. So it's rather comic: "go to
Nineveh" and he got up and went the opposite direction as far as he
could. He tried to flee from the Lord's service.] "…He went down to
Joppa [Jaffa] and found a ship going to Tarshish. He paid the fare and
went aboard to sail with the others to Tarshish, away from the service
of the Lord."</p>

<p>So he does this immediate about-face in a very comic touch and sets
sail for Spain, the other end of the Mediterranean. But of course,
Jonah cannot escape from God, and God sends a storm which threatens to
destroy the ship.</p>

<p>The non-Israelite sailors on board pray to their gods and then
finally they cast lots in order to discover who it is who's brought
this danger to the ship. And the lot falls to Jonah. So Jonah confesses
that he's a Hebrew who worships the Lord who, as he now realizes, made
both land and sea. And that is a fact that strikes great terror in the
heart of the sailors when they hear this, that his God is Yahweh. Jonah
further adds that he's trying to flee from God's service and the clear
implication is that he is the cause of this terrible storm.</p>

<p>So Jonah proposes that he be thrown overboard to save the ship. The
sailors strive mightily to battle the storm but finally in despair they
pray to God, Yahweh, to forgive them for killing an innocent man. And
they heave Jonah overboard and save the ship.</p>

<p>Now, the sailors are said by the narrator to revere God. They offer
a sacrifice to him. They make vows. In the meantime, God has appointed
a huge fish to swallow Jonah and so preserve his life. And from the
belly of this fish, Jonah prays to God. The prayer or the psalm is not
entirely appropriate to the narrative context. It's probably an
insertion in the story by a later writer. It's an insertion that was
probably suggested by references within the prayer to drowning in the
deep, to crying out to God from the "belly" of Sheol--and Jonah is in
the "belly" of the fish, so that linguistic resonance may very well
have been what prompted someone to insert this prayer here. In any
event, in response to Jonah's prayer, God orders the fish to spew Jonah
out onto dry land. In chapter 3, Jonah gets his second chance. God
calls him again and in contrast to his first response, this time Jonah
sets out for Nineveh at once. And he proclaims God's message: "In forty
days Nineveh will be overthrown." And then comes the shocking element
in the story.</p>

<p>Chapter 3:5-10:</p>

<blockquote>The people of Nineveh believed God. They proclaimed a fast,
and great and small alike put on sackcloth. And when the news reached
the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his robe, put on
sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he had the word cried through Nineveh:
"By decree of the king and his nobles: No man or beast--of flock or
herd--shall taste anything! They shall not graze, and they shall not
drink water! They shall be covered with sackcloth--man and beast--and
shall cry mightily to God. Let everyone turn back from his evil ways
and from the injustice of which he is guilty. Who knows but that God
may turn and relent? He may turn back from his wrath, so that we do not
perish."<br />
<br />
God saw what they did, how they were turning back from their evil ways.
And God renounced the punishment He had planned to bring upon them, and
did not carry it out.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So idolatrous Nineveh believes God and humbles itself before God
hoping to arouse his mercy. And in another humorous touch, we read that
even the animals are wearing sackcloth--they're fasting and crying out
to God. So from the greatest to the very least, the inhabitants of
Nineveh turn back from their evil ways and God's mercy is in fact
aroused.</p>

<p>The Assyrians are spared, and Jonah is furious. Chapter 4:1-4:</p>

<blockquote>This displeased Jonah greatly, and he was grieved. He
prayed to the Lord, saying, "O Lord! Isn't this just what I said when I
was still in my own country? That is why I fled beforehand to Tarshish.
For I know that You are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to
anger, abounding in kindness, renouncing punishment. Please, Lord, take
my life, for I would rather die than live." The Lord replied, "Are you
that deeply grieved?"</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Jonah doesn't respond; he just leaves the city to sulk. And his
complaint seems to be twofold. If you're going to punish the wicked
then just punish them. They deserve it. And if you're planning to spare
them, then just spare them and don't waste my time with messages and
oracles.</p>

<p>But the stronger problem for Jonah seems to be the lack of
punishment for the wicked. Jonah is indignant that the Assyrians didn't
get what they so richly deserved: didn't I say this would happen? You
always forgive, you're this slow-to-anger, compassionate guy! You
always repent, the wicked are never punished! I'm fed up with the way
you do things, God. Your mercy perverts your justice. And some things
ought not to be forgiven. People must be held to account for their evil
actions. How can God not do justice?</p>

<p>Jonah sits in a little booth that he has constructed and God causes
a leafy plant to grow over him, providing shade and saving him from a
good deal of discomfort. And the plant is to be the source of a final
lesson for Jonah. Jonah 4:6-11:</p>

<blockquote>…Jonah was very happy about the plant. But the next day at
dawn God provided a worm, which attacked the plant so that it withered.
And when the sun rose, God provided a sultry east wind; and the sun
beat down on Jonah's head, and he became faint. He begged for death,
saying, "I would rather die than live." Then God said to Jonah, "Are
you so deeply grieved about the plant?" "Yes," he replied, "so deeply
that I want to die."<br />
 Then the Lord said, "You cared about the plant, which you did not work
for and which you did not grow, which appeared overnight and perished
overnight. And should not I care about Nineveh, that great city, in
which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons who do
not yet know their right hand from their left, and many beasts as
well!"</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>How could Yahweh not be compassionate? For even the most evil of
peoples are no less his creation that he has cared for, than precious
Israel. And if they will only turn to Him in humility, he'll wipe the
slate clean, he'll show compassion and forgive. It is only human to
long for the punishment of the wicked. But God longs for their
re-formation, their turning.</p>

<p>The date of the book of Jonah really can't be ascertained and you
will hear arguments in both directions. Many scholars date it late;
others suppose that the story is at least at base an old, old story.
Nineveh appears as another Sodom, basically. It's a story that is in
keeping with that older Torah tradition in which it's assumed that God
punishes non-Israelites or other nations for immorality, but not
necessarily for idolatry.</p>

<p>The gentile sailors even, who worship others, are not necessarily
punished and in fact, it's said that they revere God and they're
reluctant to throw this man overboard. Other nations are not obligated,
in the view of this book as in the early traditions of Genesis, to
accept monotheism. But they're bound by a certain basic moral law,
maybe the moral law of the Noahide covenant, and it's for this that God
has decreed punishment.</p>

<p>So the theme or the basic problem in this short book is the problem
of God's justice verses his mercy. And Jonah is a champion of divine
justice. He believes that sin should be punished, he's outraged at
God's forgiveness. But Jonah learns that a change of heart is enough to
obtain mercy, and that the true role of the prophet is perhaps to move
people to reformation and turning.</p>

<p>What must have been the reception of this book in the post-exilic
period? Again, not knowing exactly when it was written--We can imagine,
however, in the manner of a canonical critic, how it might have been
perceived by people in the post-exilic period for whom it would have
become canonical.</p>

<p>The very idea of a prophet being sent to Nineveh--Nineveh the
capital of the hated Assyrian empire, the home of the people who had
destroyed the Northern Kingdom of Israel and the ten tribes of Israel
in 722, dispersing those ten tribes forever, the nation that had then
laid siege to Jerusalem and exacted tribute from Judah for many
years--this must have been startling. Ultimately then, this book would
represent a strand of thought in post-exilic Judah that differed very
much from the eschatological fervor that delighted in fantasies of the
destruction of Israel's enemies, such as we found in Joel and as would
be featured later in Daniel, and in post-biblical apocalyptic
literature most notably the Christian book of Revelation.</p>

<p>The book of Jonah reminded Israel that the universal God is desirous
of the reformation and the turning of all his creation, human and
animal. And proposes that the Israelite prophet is called upon to carry
a message of divine forgiveness to other nations, not just judgment.
Even those that have humiliated and despised God's chosen. So wittingly
or unwittingly, we may never know, the author of this little satire
fostered the post-exilic sense of Israel as a light unto the nations.
This is an idea that we've already seen in some of the late prophetic
writings.</p>

<p>Just a few words of conclusion. The literature of the Hebrew Bible
relates the odyssey of Israel from its earliest beginnings in the
stories of individual Patriarchs worshiping a Canaanite deity to its
maturity as a nation forced by history to look beyond its own horizons
and concerns.</p>

<p>The Israelites were lifted up to become something greater than they
could ever have planned. They came to see themselves as God's servants
to the world, at the same time that they struggled and argued with
their God and criticized themselves for their very human weaknesses and
failings.</p>

<p>From another vantage point, the Bible can be seen also as an
anthology that struggles against great odds to sustain a peoples'
covenantal relationship with God.</p>

<p>The contrast between reality and the religious-moral ideal that good
prospers and evil is defeated was a distressing and perplexing problem
that occupied the biblical writers. The existence of evil, the
suffering of the righteous, the defeat of God's chosen, all this seemed
basically incompatible with certain fundamental monotheistic
intuitions; that God holds supreme power in the universe, that God is
essentially good and just, and his providential care extends throughout
creation. How can faith in such a God be upheld in the face of evil and
suffering?</p>

<p>Although, all ancient cultures--and modern cultures--struggle with
the problem of evil, it had particular poignancy for ancient Israel. In
other Ancient Near Eastern literatures, we find doubt about the
existence of a moral order, certainly. But only in Israel does the
question of evil touch on the very essence of God and the very
foundation of religious faith. Paganism posits the existence of
primordial evil demons or gods, and thus the existence of evil and
suffering does not impugn the good gods themselves.</p>

<p>Later religious systems that grow out of the Bible will in fact
increasingly posit demons or a devil. Second Temple Judaism,
later-rabbinic Judaism, and most especially Christianity, will posit
some devil to account for evil in the world. Undeserved suffering,
outrageous and frustrating as it might be, can then be explained at
least by the jealousy or the caprice of the evil angels or gods or the
demons or devil, who are indifferent to man's fate. But in biblical
religion there is no independent evil principal. And so, undeserved
suffering and rampant evil impugn the goodness and justice of God
himself.</p>

<p>Biblical persons have no refuge from evil and suffering other than
faith in God's justice. And if that justice is slow in coming, then
despair and doubt threaten. For this reason, Israelite theodicy, I
think, is charged with great pathos because the stakes are so high. If
one loses faith in an essentially moral universe, one loses God. Or at
least as we saw in the Book of Job, one loses a God who governs the
world according to a clear moral standard.</p>

<p>But the biblical writers don't approach the problem as philosophers
or theologians might. For the philosopher, theodicy, the problem of
evil is primarily a logical problem, it's a contradiction. How can a
just and good God allow evil and suffering to exist in the world? And
like any other logical problem, it's best solved--according to the
philosophers and theologians--through the careful construction of a
systematic argument.</p>

<p>This is not the method or the approach of the biblical writers. For
them, the problem is not philosophical; it is personal, it is
psychological, it is spiritual. The burning question is really this,
how can one sustain a commitment to Israel's God in the face of
national catastrophe and personal suffering? How can one have the
strength to embrace, to trust, to love this God knowing that
unpredictable suffering and chaos have struck and may again strike at
any moment?</p>

<p>And various writers from various periods add their voices to
Israel's struggle to come to terms with the problem of sustaining faith
in the midst of evil and suffering. The Bible's aim is not to solve the
philosophical problem of theodicy, so much as it is to enable the
relationship with God to survive all shocks, to make life in covenant
with God a viable option, despite the evil and the suffering that are
experienced by the faithful.</p>

<p>The Bible doesn't offer one single model of how to cope with this
problem. A dynamic relationship with what is perceived to be a living
personal God rather than the static God of the philosophers, is too
complex to be captured in a single dimensional theology. Systematic
theology could not do justice to the variegated experiences of the
nation and of an individual life, and that's not the mode or genre
chosen by the biblical writers.</p>

<p>And so various models are presented, not all consistent with one
another, but each serving a particular segment of the community coping
with a particular challenge at a particular time. Each is an attempt to
sustain Israel's relationship with God in the face of challenges to
that continued relationship. Biblical writers tell stories and they
interpret history in order to illustrate the many ways in which various
individuals and the nation as a whole, have managed to make sense of
the covenantal relationship with God. There's room for multiple models,
multiple images of God and his relationship to Israel. And as modern
readers of the Bible, we can only marvel at this unresolved polyphony
in this ancient anthology. It's as if the rabbis who were later to
canonize this collection saw the truth in the words of <i>Qohelet</i>,
that to everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under
heaven. And so they included books with very different approaches to
the fundamental problems that face the ancient Israelites as Israelites
and as human beings.</p>

<p>So after 586 BCE, the Deuteronomist salvaged Yahwism from going the
way of other defeated national religions by arguing that Israel had
suffered not because God's promises weren't true but because they
weren't believed. And this enabled the Israelites to continue faithful
to their God, despite the destruction of his sanctuary, his chosen city
and his ruler.</p>

<p>The prophets emphasized the moral and communal aspects of the
covenant without which all sacrificial worship was anathema. And so
they unwittingly prepared the way for a worship without sacrifice in
the Diaspora, and in later Judaism. The Psalms give expression to the
deepest emotions of the worshiper struggling with personal despair and
anger or brimming over with joy and faith. Job gives vent to the
outrage we feel over unjust suffering, while Ecclesiastes preaches
existential pleasures as a solace for the vanity of all human
endeavor.</p>

<p>Ezra and Nehemiah confront the very real problem of assimilation and
identity with a call to Israel to close ranks, while Jonah and Ruth
remind Jews of the universal providence of their God and the power of
repentance. Esther and Daniel provide encouragement of radically
different types for Jews under threat of persecution and massacre – one
a plea for self-reliance and solidarity, and the other, a promise of
divine intervention in an apocalypse.</p>

<p>Do all these books contradict each other? No more than I contradict
myself when I say that today I feel happy, but yesterday I felt
anxious. Israel's relationship with God has always been a dynamic and a
complex one. To each of these books there was a time and a purpose in
the past, and as countless readers of the Bible have discovered over
the centuries these books offer continued teaching and inspiration in
the shifting moments of every age.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your attention this semester. Don't forget
the review session that will be held here with me next week from
10:30-12:30. And you're early; you get to go home ten minutes early.
Thank you.</p>
