<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> So, last time I gave a reading of
the creation accounts that are in Genesis 1 to 3. These are two very
different stories but their placement side by side suggests the
possibility of a joint reading. Nevertheless they are very different in
character, and today I want to focus in on the second creation story.
This is a story that is predominantly in Genesis 2 and trickles into
Genesis 3, and I'm going to look at it mostly in isolation from the
first account. I'm going to be looking at it in light of an important
parallel. This parallel is <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i>--I get to point
this way now, to the boards, okay? <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i>, and
I'll be drawing on the work of many scholars, Nahum Sarna probably most
prominently among them, but others also who have devoted themselves to
the study of these textual parallels, and developing an interpretation
of these stories. I'd like you to carry that with you into your
discussion sections as you look at some of the other interpretations
from antiquity and on into the modern period.</p>

<p>Now <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i> is a magnificent Mesopotamian epic
that relates the exploits of a Sumerian king, King Gilgamesh of Uruk.
That's the name of the city-state over which he is king. And the epic
as we now have it was probably composed between 2000 and 1800 BCE.
Gilgamesh was apparently a historical character, an actual king of
Uruk, but the story of course has fantastic and legendary qualities to
it. We have a full text of the epic that was located in the library of
Assurbanipal, an Assyrian king. It's a seventh century copy of the
story. But we have fragments that are much, much older (that date back
to the eighteenth century) that were found in Iraq. So clearly it's an
old story and we have even older prototypes for elements of the story
as well.</p>

<p>The story opens with a description of Gilgamesh. He's an extremely
unpopular king. He's tyrannical, he's rapacious, he's undisciplined,
he's over-sexed. The people in the city cry out to the gods. They want
relief from him. They particularly cite his abuses towards the young
women of the city. And the god Aruru is told that she must deal with
Gilgamesh. Aruru is on the board.</p>

<p>So Aruru fashions this noble savage named Enkidu. Enkidu is designed
to be a match for Gilgamesh, and he's very much like the biblical human
in Genesis 2. He's sort of an innocent primitive, he appears unclothed,
he lives a free, peaceful life in harmony with the animals, with nature
and the beasts, he races across the steppes with the gazelles. But
before he can enter the city and meet Gilgamesh he has to be tamed.</p>

<p>So a woman is sent to Enkidu and her job is to provide the sexual
initiation that will tame and civilize Enkidu. I'm reading now from
<i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i> (Pritchard 1958, 40-75):</p>

<blockquote>For six days and seven nights Enkidu comes forth,<br />
 mating with the lass.<br />
 After he had had (his) fill of her charms,<br />
 He set his face toward his wild beasts.<br />
 On seeing him, Enkidu, the gazelles ran off,<br />
 The wild beasts of the steppe drew away from his body.<br />
 Startled was Enkidu, as his body became taut.<br />
 His knees were motionless--for his wild beasts had gone.<br />
 Enkidu had to slacken his pace--it was not as before;<br />
 But he now had [wi]sdom, [br]oader understanding.<br />
 Returning, he sits at the feet of the harlot.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>I'm not sure why that translation [harlot]. I've been told by those
who know Akkadian that the word could mean "harlot/prostitute," it
could mean some sacred prostitute… I'm not an expert in Akkadian.
But:</p>

<blockquote>He looks up at the face of the harlot,<br />
 His ears attentive, as the harlot speaks;<br />
 [The harlot] says to him, to Enkidu:<br />
 "Thou art [wi]se, Enkidu, art become like a god!<br />
 Why with the wild creatures dost though roam over the steppe?<br />
 Come, let me lead thee [to] ramparted Uruk,<br />
 To the holy Temple, abode of Anu and Ishtar,<br />
 Where lives Gilgamesh, accomplished in strength<br />
 And like a wild ox lords it over the folk."<br />
 As she speaks to him, her words find favor,<br />
 His heart enlightened, he yearns for a friend.<br />
 Enkidu says to her, to the harlot:<br />
 "Up lass, escort thou me (to Gilgamesh)…<br />
I will challenge him [and will bo]ldly address him."</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>So that's tablet I from <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i>.</p>

<p>So through this sexual experience Enkidu has become wise, growing in
mental and spiritual stature, and he is said to have become like a god.
At the same time there's been a concomitant loss of innocence. His
harmonious unity with nature is broken, he clothes himself, and his old
friends the gazelles run from him now. He will never again roam free
with the animals. He cannot run as quickly. His pace slackens, he can't
even keep up with them. So as one reads the epic one senses this very
deep ambivalence regarding the relative virtues and evils of civilized
life, and many of the features that make us human. On the one hand it's
clearly good that humans rise above the animals and build cities and
wear clothes and pursue the arts of civilization and develop bonds of
love and duty and friendship the way that animals do not; these are the
things that make humans like the gods in <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i>.
But on the other hand these advances have also come at a cost. And in
this story there's also a sense of longing for the freedom of life in
the wild--the innocent, simple, uncomplicated life lived day to day
without plans, without toil, in harmony with nature, a somewhat Edenic
existence.</p>

<p>So there are very obvious parallels between this part of the epic
that I've just read to you and our second creation story. Enkidu like
Adam is fashioned from clay. He's a noble savage, he's a kind of
innocent primitive, and he lives in a peaceful co-existence with
animals. Nature yields its fruits to him without hard labor. He's
unaware of--he's unattracted by--the benefits of civilization:
clothing, cities and all their labor. Just as Enkidu gains wisdom and
becomes like a god, and loses his oneness with nature, so Adam and Eve
after eating the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil are said to
have become like gods, and they also lose their harmonious relationship
with nature. In Genesis 3:15, God says to the snake:</p>

<blockquote>"I will put enmity<br />
Between you and the woman,<br />
And between your offspring and hers;<br />
They shall strike at your head,<br />
And you shall strike at their heel."</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Presumably there had been a peaceful relationship between creatures
like snakes and humans to that point. They [humans] are banished now
from the Garden. It used to yield its fruits to them without any labor,
but now humans have to toil for food and the earth yields its fruits
only stintingly. So in Genesis 3:18, God says to Adam:</p>

<blockquote>"Cursed be the ground because of you;<br />
By toil shall you eat of it<br />
All the days of your life:<br />
Thorns and thistles shall it sprout for you.<br />
But your food shall be the grasses of the field;<br />
By the sweat of your brow<br />
Shall you get bread to eat"</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So knowledge or wisdom or perhaps moral freedom, seem to come at a
very high price.</p>

<p>But there are important differences between these stories too. And
the most important has to do with the nature of the act that leads to
the transformation of the human characters. It's Enkidu's sexual
experience, his seven-day encounter with the woman that makes him wise
and godlike at the cost of his life with the beasts. There has been a
long tradition of interpreting the deed or the sin of Adam and Eve as
sexual, and there are some hints in the story that would support such
an interpretation. I was just reading recently a scholarly introduction
to Genesis that very much argues and develops this interpretation. Adam
and Eve eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in
violation of God's command. Now eating can perhaps be a metaphor for
sex, some have argued. Knowledge of good and evil--perhaps that could
be understood in sexual terms. In biblical Hebrew the word "to know"
can mean "to know" in the biblical sense. It can mean sexual
intercourse. Snakes are symbols of renewed life and fertility in the
East because they shed their skins so they seem to be eternally young;
and they're also phallic symbols. Eve says that the snake seduced her.
[She] uses a term that has some sexual overtones.</p>

<p>So do all of these hints suggest that, in the biblical view, the
change in Adam and Eve came about through sex? If so, is sex a negative
thing forbidden by God? It would depend if you view the change as a
negative thing. That seems unlikely in my view. You will certainly hear
it argued, but it seems unlikely in my view. God's first command to the
first couple was to be fruitful and multiply. Now admittedly that comes
from the first creation story in Genesis 1; nevertheless in the second
creation story when the writer is recounting the creation of woman, the
writer refers to the fact that man and woman will become one flesh. So
it seems that sex was part of the plan for humans even at creation.</p>

<p>Also, it's only after their defiance of God's command that Adam and
Eve first become aware of, and ashamed by, their nakedness, putting the
sort of sexual awakening after the act of disobedience rather then at
the same time or prior to. So maybe what we have here is another
polemic, another adaptation of familiar stories and motifs to express
something new. Perhaps for the biblical writer, Adam and Eve's
transformation occurs after an act of disobedience, not after a
seven-day sexual encounter.</p>

<p>The disobedience happens in a rather backhanded way. It's kind of
interesting. God tells Adam before the creation of Eve that he's not to
eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that's in Genesis
2:16, on pain of death. Eve doesn't hear this command directly. She has
not yet been created. In Genesis 3 we meet the cunning serpent, and
although many later Hellenistic Jewish texts and the New Testament will
identify the snake as a Satan, an enticer, a tempter, some sort of evil
creature, he doesn't seem to be so in this fable. There's no real devil
or Satan character--we'll talk about Job later--in the Hebrew Bible,
the snake in Eden is simply a talking animal. He's a standard literary
device that you see in fables of this period, and later--the kind that
you find for example in the fables of Aesop. And the woman responds to
the serpent's queries by saying that eating and even touching the tree
is forbidden on pain of death.</p>

<p>One wonders whence the addition of touching. Did Adam convey God's
command to Eve with an emphasis all his own? "Don't even touch that
tree, Eve. It's curtains for us if you do." She didn't hear the
original command. Or did she just mishear in some very tragic version
of the telephone game. And the serpent tells her, No, "you are not
going to die" if you touch or eat the fruit. In fact, he adds, the
fruit will bring you wisdom making humans like gods who know good and
bad. And in fact that's certainly true. He tells her the truth.</p>

<p>Genesis 3:7 is a very critical verse and it's rarely properly
translated. Most translations read like this: "She took of its fruit
and ate. She also gave some to her husband and he ate." The implication
is that Eve acts alone and then she goes and finds Adam and gives him
some of the apple and convinces him to eat it. But in fact the Hebrew
literally reads, "She took of its fruit and ate and gave also to her
husband <i>with her</i>, and he ate." "With her" is a very teeny-tiny
little word in Hebrew, so I guess a lot of translations figure they can
leave it out. But the "with her" is there in the Hebrew. At that
fateful moment, Adam and Eve are standing together at the tree, and
although only the woman and the serpent speak, Adam was present, and it
seems he accepted the fruit that his wife handed him. He was fully
complicitous, and indeed God holds him responsible. He reproaches Adam.
Adam says: Well, Eve handed it to me. She gave it to me. Eve explains,
the serpent tricked me. God vents his fury on all three, and he does so
in ascending order: first the snake for his trickery and then the
woman, and finally the man.</p>

<p>So just as the harlot tells Enkidu after his sexual awakening that
he has become like a god, so Adam and Eve after eating the forbidden
fruit are said to be like divine beings. Why? Perhaps because they have
become wise in that they have learned they have moral choice. They have
free will, they can defy God and God's plans for them in a way that
animals and natural phenomena cannot. But now that means there is a
serious danger here, and in Genesis 3:22, God says, "Now that man has
become like one of us, knowing good and evil [bad], what if he should
stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and
live forever?" So it's the threat of an immortal antagonist that is so
disturbing and must be avoided. And so God banishes Adam and Eve from
the Garden and he stations these <i>kerubim</i>, these cherubim--not
puffy cute little babies like Raphael painted, but these fierce
monstrous creatures--and a fiery, ever-turning sword to guard the way
back to the tree of life. It is now inaccessible.</p>

<p>So the acceptance of mortality as an inescapable part of the human
condition: it's a part of this story. It's also one of the themes of
<i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i>. As the story continues Enkidu enters the
city and Enkidu earns Gilgamesh's respect and deep love. This is the
first time that this rapacious tyrant has ever actually loved anyone
and his character is reformed as a result. And then the rest of the
epic contains the adventures of these two close friends, all of the
things that they do together. And when Enkidu dies, Gilgamesh is
absolutely devastated. He's for the first time confronted with his own
mortality. He's obsessed with grief over Enkidu, and he's obsessed with
the whole issue of mortality. He begins a quest for immortality, and
that takes up most of the rest of the epic. He leaves the city, he
travels far and wide, he crosses these primeval seas and endures all
sorts of hardships. And finally exhausted and battered he reaches
Utnapishtim, also there on the board, Utnapishtim, who is the only
mortal ever to have been granted immortality by the gods, and he comes
to him and asks for his secret. It turns out that Utnapishtim can't
help him, and we'll come back to Utnapishtim later in the flood story,
and Gilgamesh is devastated. He then learns the whereabouts of a plant
of eternal youth. And he says: Well that's better than nothing. That at
least will keep him young. And so he goes after the plant of eternal
youth, but he's negligent for a moment and a thieving snake or serpent
manages to steal it and that explains why snakes are always shedding
their skins and are forever young. Gilgamesh is exhausted, he feels
defeated, he returns to Uruk, and as he stands looking at the city from
a distance, gazing at it, he takes comfort in the thought that although
humans are finite and frail and doomed to die, their accomplishments
and their great works give them some foothold in human memory.</p>

<p>Now Nahum Sarna is one of the people who has pointed out that the
quest for immortality, which is so central in <i>The Epic of
Gilgamesh</i>, is really deflected in the biblical story. The tree of
life is mentioned, and it's mentioned with a definite article. Genesis
2:9 says, "with <i>the</i> tree of life in the middle of the garden,"
as if this is a motif we're familiar with, as if this is something we
all know about. But then it's really not mentioned again as the story
proceeds. The snake, which in <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i> is
associated with the plant of eternal youth, in Genesis is associated
instead with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. That's the
focus of our attention in Genesis, and it's only at the end of the
story that the tree of life appears again in the passage that is
emphasizing its permanent inaccessibility.</p>

<p>And we could perhaps draw two conclusions from this. First it may be
that Adam and Eve had access to this tree up to that point. As long as
their will conformed to the will of God, there was no danger to their
going on eternally, being immortal. Once they discovered their moral
freedom, once they discovered that they could thwart God and work evil
in the world, and abuse and corrupt all that God had created, then God
could not afford to allow them access to the tree of life. That would
be tantamount to creating divine enemies, immortal enemies. So God must
maintain the upper hand in his struggle with these humans who have
learned to defy him. And he maintains the upper hand in this, the fact
that they eventually must die. Second of all the motif of guards who
block access to the tree of life suggests that no humans have access to
immortality and the pursuit of immortality is futile. So it might be
then that God really spoke the truth after all. The fruit did bring
death to humankind.</p>

<p>Before we leave this story and move onto Cain and Abel, I just want
to make a couple of quick observations. First of all the opening
chapters of Genesis, Genesis 1 through 3, have been subjected to
centuries of theological interpretation, and I hope that you're in the
midst of reading some of them now. They have generated for example the
doctrine of original sin, which is the idea that humans after Adam are
born into a state of sin, by definition. As many ancient interpreters
already have observed, the actions of Adam and Eve bring death to the
human race. They don't bring a state of utter and unredeemed
sinfulness. In fact what they tell us is that humans have moral choice
in each and every age. The story is primarily etiological rather then
prescriptive or normative. We've talked about this: these etiological
tales are tales that are trying to explain how or why something is the
way it is. This is why serpents shed their skin, for example. In <i>The
Epic of Gilgamesh</i> they were the ones who got the plant of eternal
youth. It's etiological. The writer observes that humans emerge from
innocent childhood to self-conscious adulthood. The writer observes
that survival is a difficult endeavor and that the world can sometimes
seem harshly hostile. The writer observes that women are desirous of
and emotionally bonded to the very persons who establish the conditions
of their subordination. The story is explaining how these odd
conditions of life came to be as they are, which is not to say that
it's the ideal situation, or even that it's God's will for humankind;
these are etiological fables, and they're best read as such.</p>

<p>Second of all in this story we see something that we'll see
repeatedly in the Pentateuch, and that is that God has to punt a bit.
He has to modify his plans for the first couple, by barring access to
the tree of life. That was not something presumably he planned to do.
This is in response to, perhaps, their unforeseen disobedience:
certainly the way the story unfolds that's how it seems to us. So
despite their newfound mortality, humans are going to be a force to be
reckoned with. They're unpredictable to the very god who created
them.</p>

<p>Finally I'll just draw your attention to some interesting details
that you can think about and maybe talk about in section. God ruminates
that the humans have become like "one of <i>us</i>" in the plural. That
echoes his words in Genesis 1 where he proposes, "Let <i>us</i> make
humans," or humankind, "in our image." Again in the plural. Who is he
talking to? And what precisely are these cherubim that are stationed in
front of the tree of life barring access? What do we make of these
allusions to divine colleagues or subordinates in light of Kaufman's
claims regarding biblical monotheism? You should be bringing some of
the things we talked about when discussing his work, into dialogue with
and in conflict with some of the evidence you'll be finding in the text
itself. So think about these things, don't pass over these details
lightly, and don't take them for granted.</p>

<p>The Cain and Abel story which is in Genesis 4:1 through 16: this is
the story of the first murder, and it's a murder that happens despite
God's warning to Cain that it's possible to master the urge to violence
by an act of will. He says, "Sin couches at the door;/Its urge is
toward you/Yet you can be its master," Genesis 4:7. Nahum Sarna and
others have noted that the word "brother" occurs throughout this story
repeatedly, and it climaxes in God's question, "Where is your
<i>brother</i>, Abel?" And Cain responds, "I don't know; am I my
<i>brother's</i> keeper?" And ironically you sense, when you read this
that, even though Cain intends this as a rhetorical question--"Am I my
brother's keeper?"--in fact, he's right on the money. Yes. We are all
of us our brothers' keepers, and the strong implication of the story is
as Sarna puts it, that all homicide is in fact fratricide. That seems
to be the message of this story.</p>

<p>Note also that Cain is culpable, and for someone to be culpable of
something we have to assume some principle that they have violated. And
therefore this story assumes the existence of what some writers, Sarna
among them, have called "the universal moral law." There seems to be in
existence from the beginning of creation this universal moral law, and
that is: the God-endowed sanctity of human life. We can connect it with
the fact that God has created humans in his own image, but the
God-endowed sanctity of human life is an assumption, and it's the
violation of that assumption which makes Cain culpable.</p>

<p>The story of Cain and Abel is notable for another theme, and this is
a theme that's going to recur in the Bible, and that is the tension
between settled areas and the unsettled desert areas and desert life of
the nomads. Abel is a keeper of sheep. He represents the nomadic
pastoralist, unlike Cain who is the tiller of soil, so he represents
more settled urban life. God prefers the offering of Abel, and as a
result Cain is distressed and jealous to the point of murder. God's
preference for the offering of Abel valorizes the free life of the
nomadic pastoralist over urban existence. Even after the Israelites
will settle in their own land, the life of the desert pastoralist
remained a sort of romantic ideal for them. It's a theme that we'll see
coming up in many of the stories. It's a romantic ideal for this writer
too.</p>

<p>Now the murder of Abel by Cain is followed by some genealogical
lists. They provide some continuity between the tales. They tell us
folkloric traditions about the origins of various arts, the origins of
building, of metalwork and music, but finally in Genesis 6:5 we read
that, "every imagination of the thoughts of his heart," the human
heart, "was evil continuously" [Revised Standard Version translation].
And this sets the stage then for the story of a worldwide flood.</p>

<p>Now here again the Bible is making use of older traditions and
motifs and adapting them to their own purposes. I've hinted at this
already and we'll look at it in a bit more detail now. We know of a
very ancient Sumerian flood story. The hero is Ziusudra, also on the
board. We also know of a very early Semitic work, the <i>Epic of
Atrahasis</i>, in which there's a flood. But the most detailed flood
story we have actually comes from <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i>, on the
eleventh tablet of <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i>. You'll remember that
in his search for immortality Gilgamesh sought out Utnapishtim, the one
human who had been granted immortality. He wants to learn his secret.
And when he begs for the secret of eternal life he gets Utnapishtim's
story, and it's the flood story. He learns that Utnapishtim and his
wife gained their immortality by a twist of circumstances: they were
the sole survivors of this great flood, and as a kind of reward they
were given immortality.</p>

<p>The Sumerian story of Ziusudra is very similar to the Genesis
account. In both you have the flood coming about as the deliberate
result of a divine decision; you have one individual who's chosen to be
saved from the flood; that individual is given specific instructions on
building an ark, and is given specific instructions on who to bring
on-board the ark. The ark also comes to rest on a mountaintop, the hero
sends out a bird to reconnoiter the land, to find out if it's dry yet.
When the hero emerges he builds an altar. He offers sacrifice to the
deity and receives a blessing. Very similar, parallel stories, and yet
there are significant contrasts between the Mesopotamian story and its
Israelite adaptation.</p>

<p>Let's compare some of the elements from all three of the stories
with the biblical story. In <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i> we have no
motive given for the divine destruction whatsoever. It just seems to be
pure capriciousness. In the <i>Epic of Atrahasis</i> we do in fact read
of a reason, and the text there states, "The land became wide and the
people became numerous. The land bellowed like wild oxen. The god was
disturbed by their uproar. Enlil heard the clamor and said to the gods,
"Oppressive has become the clamor of [hu]mankind. By their uproar they
prevent sleep" [Pritchard 1950, 1955, 104]. So it seems that humankind
is to be destroyed because they irritate the gods with their tumult and
noise. In the Gilgamesh epic, Ea, an earth-water god, does ask another
god, Enlil, how he could have brought the flood on so senselessly. He
says, "Lay upon the sinner the sin; Lay upon the transgressor his
transgression" [Pritchard 1950, 1955, 95], which would indicate that in
<i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i> there is this element of
capriciousness.</p>

<p>The biblical writer in retelling the story seems to want to reject
this idea by providing a moral rationale for God's actions. The earth,
the text says, is destroyed because of <i>hamas</i>. <i>Hamas</i> is a
word that literally means violence, bloodshed, but also all kinds of
injustice and oppression. Noah is saved specifically for his
righteousness, he was righteous in his generation. He was chosen
therefore for moral reasons. So the writer seems very determined to
tell the story in a way that depicts God as acting not capriciously but
according to certain clear standards of justice. This was deserved
punishment and the person who was saved was righteous.</p>

<p>Furthermore in the Mesopotamian accounts the gods do not appear to
be in control. This is something that's been pointed out by many
writers. Enlil wants to destroy humankind completely. He's thwarted by
Ea who drops hints of the disaster to Utnapishtim so Utnapishtim knows
what to do and therefore manages to escape the flood. But that's
thwarting the design of the god who brought the flood. He wanted
everything destroyed. When the flood comes the gods themselves seem to
have lost control. They're terrified, they cower. The text says they
"cowered like dogs crouched against the outer wall. Ishtar," the
goddess Ishtar, "cried out like a woman in labor [travail] [Pritchard
1958, 69]. And moreover during the period of the flood they don't have
food, they don't have sustenance. At the end when Utnapishtim offers
the sacrifice, the gods are famished and they crowd around the
sacrifice like flies, the text says [Pritchard 1958, 70].</p>

<p>The biblical writer wants to tell a different story. In the biblical
flood story, God is represented as being unthreatened by the forces of
nature that he unleashes, and being completely in control. He makes the
decision to punish humans because the world has corrupted itself
through <i>hamas</i>, through bloodshed and violence. He selects Noah
due to his righteousness and he issues a direct command to build an
ark. He has a clear purpose and he retains control throughout the
story. At the end, the writer doesn't depict him as needing the
sacrifice for food or sustenance.</p>

<p>We might say that this story, like the story of Cain and Abel before
it, and like the story we will read later of Sodom and Gomorrah, this
story presupposes this universal moral law that Sarna and Kaufman and
others have talked about, this universal moral law that seems to govern
the world, and if God sees infractions of it, then as supreme judge he
brings humans to account. If morality is the will of God, morality then
becomes an absolute value, and these infractions will be punished, in
the biblical writer's view.</p>

<p>The message of the flood story also seems to be that when humans
destroy the moral basis of society, when they are violent or cruel or
unkind, they endanger the very existence of that society. The world
dissolves. So corruption and injustice and lawlessness and violence
inevitably bring about destruction.</p>

<p>Some writers have pointed out that it's interesting that these
humans are not being punished for religious sins, for idolatry, for
worshipping the wrong god or anything of that nature, and this is
important. The view of the first books of the Bible is that each nation
worships its own gods, its own way, perhaps. At this point in the
story, perhaps the view is that all know of God even if they ignore
him. But the view eventually will be that only Israel is obligated to
the God of Israel, other nations aren't held accountable for their
idolatry in the books of the Torah. We'll see this is we continue
along. And yet everyone, all humans, Israelites or non-Israelites
alike, by virtue of having been created by God in the image of
God--even though they may not know that God, or may ignore that
God--they are bound to a basic moral law that precludes murder and,
perhaps from this story, we could argue other forms of oppression and
violence.</p>

<p>What better way to drive home the point that inhumanity and violence
undermine the very foundations of society than to describe a situation
in which a cosmic catastrophe results from human corruption and
violence. It's an idea that runs throughout the Bible, it also appears
in later Jewish thought and some Christian thought, some Islamic
thought. The Psalmist is going to use this motif when he denounces
social injustice, exploitation of the poor and so on. He says through
wicked deeds like this "all the foundations of the earth," are moved,
"are shaken" [Psalm 82:5, RSV].</p>

<p>The Noah story, the flood story, ends with the ushering in of a new
era, and it is in many ways a second creation that mirrors the first
creation in some important ways. But this time God realizes--and again
this is where God's got to punt all the time. This is what I love about
the first part of Genesis--God is trying to figure out what he has made
and what he has done, and he's got to shift modes all the time--and God
realizes that he's going to have to make a concession. He's going to
have to make a concession to human weakness and the human desire to
kill. And he's going to have to rectify the circumstances that made his
destruction of the earth necessary in the first place.</p>

<p>So he establishes a covenant with Noah: covenant. And humankind
receives its first set of explicit laws, no more implicit, "Murder is
bad." "Oh I wish I had known!" Now we're getting our first explicit set
of laws and they're universal in scope on the biblical writer's view.
They apply to all humanity not just Israel. So these are often referred
to as the terms of the Noahide covenant. They apply to all
humanity.</p>

<p>This covenant explicitly prohibits murder in Genesis 9, that is, the
spilling of human blood. Blood is the symbol of life: that's a
connection that's made elsewhere in the Bible. Leviticus 17[:11], "The
life… is in the blood." So blood is the biblical symbol for life, but
God is going to make a concession to the human appetite for power and
violence. Previously humans were to be vegetarian: Genesis 1, the
portrait was one in which humans and animals did not compete for food,
or consume one another. Humans were vegetarian. Now God is saying
humans may kill animals to eat them. But even so, he says, the animal's
life is to be treated with reverence, and the blood which is the life
essence must be poured out on the ground, returned to God, not
consumed. So the animal may be eaten to satisfy the human hunger for
flesh, but the life essence itself belongs to God. It must not be taken
even if it's for the purposes of nourishment. Genesis 9:4-6, you shall
not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood. For your lifeblood I
will surely require a reckoning; of every beast I will require it and
of humans… So if you are killed by a beast or a human, there will have
to be a reckoning, an accounting. "…of every person's brother I will
require the life of the person. Whoever sheds the blood of a person, in
exchange for that person shall his blood be shed, for God made humans
in his image [Hayes translation]. All life, human and animal, is sacred
to God. The covenant also entails God's promise to restore the rhythm
of life and nature and never again to destroy the earth. The rainbow is
set up as a symbol of the eternal covenant, a token of the eternal
reconciliation between the divine and human realms.</p>

<p>We should note that this notion, or this idea of a god who can even
make and keep an eternal covenant is only possible on the view that
God's word and will are absolute, insusceptible to nullification by
some superior power or some divine antagonist.</p>

<p>Now, I handed out, or there was handed out to you a sheet of paper.
You might want to get that out in front of you because we're going to
talk a little bit about the flood story in Genesis 6 through 9. When we
read the flood story in Genesis 6 through 9, we're often struck by the
very odd literary style. I hope you were struck by the odd literary
style, and the repetitiveness and the contradictions. So I want to ask
you now, and be brave and speak out, in your reading of the story did
anything of that nature strike you? Was the story hard to follow? Was
it self-contradictory, and in what ways? Anything? Just don't even be
polite, just throw it right out there. Yes?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes</b>: Okay, we seem to have two sets of
instructions. Someone's pointing out here, we seem to have two sets of
instructions about what to bring on-board: either to bring two of each
sort of living thing, animals and birds and creeping things, or in
another passage God tells Moses to bring on seven pairs of pure animals
and one pair of impure animals and seven pairs of birds. Right?
Different sets of instructions. Anything else strike you as odd when
you were reading this story?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes</b>: Okay, rain seems to be there for
different amounts of time, doesn't it? There are some passages in which
the flood is said to have lasted for 40 days, or be on the earth for 40
days. We find that in Genesis 7:17, but in Genesis 7:24, 150 days is
given as the time of the flood. Anything else? Any other sorts of
doublets or contradictions, because there are a few more?</p>

<p>Who's giving the instructions? That's not hard; you have it right in
front of you. Who's giving the instructions?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes</b>: Okay, God. We have the word "God"
being used I guess in that translation, right, with a capital G. What
else is used?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes</b>: Lord. Those are actually different
Hebrew words underneath there, okay? Those two terms are different
names of the deity that's giving the instruction. Okay, so there are
two designations used for God. <i>Yahweh</i>, which is the sacred
Tetragrammaton, it's written with four letters in Hebrew, they don't
include vowels. We don't really know how it's pronounced; I'm guessing
at Yahweh, and that is a proper name for God, and in your translation
that would be translated as "LORD" in small caps. So wherever you see
'"LORD" in small caps, that's actually the English translation for
Yahweh, the proper name, like almost a personal name for God. And then
in other places we have this word <i>Elohim</i>, which actually is the
word for "gods," a sort of generic term for deities in the plural.
However, when it's used to refer to the God of Israel it's clearly
singular, it always has a singular verb. So that will be appearing in
your text as "God" with a capital G. So whenever you see "Lord" or
"God" those are actually pointing to different words that are being
used in the underlying Hebrew text.</p>

<p>Twice God is said to look down on creation. Twice it is said that he
is displeased. Twice he decides to destroy all living things. Twice he
issues instructions and as we've seen they're contradictory. We seem to
also have a different account of how long the flood lasted; there are
more subtle contradictions throughout as well. Sometimes the flood
seems to be the result of very heavy rain, but in other descriptions it
seems to be a real cosmic upheaval. You'll remember the description of
the world from Genesis 1 as an air bubble essentially that's formed by
separating waters above and waters below. They're held back or pressed
back by the firmament above. And it's the windows in the firmament that
are opened--those waters are allowed to rush in and dissolve that air
bubble. It's as if we're back to square one with the deep, right? Just
this watery mass again. So it's creation undoing itself in some of the
descriptions, as opposed to just heavy rain.</p>

<p>And in keeping with that idea of a kind of a return to chaos, Noah
is represented in a way as the beginning of a new creation. Because
like Adam and Eve in the first creation story, Noah is told to be
fruitful and multiply. He's also given rule over everything, and that's
now extended to the taking of human life [correction: Professor Hayes
actually meant to say animal life here].</p>

<p>The Bible contains a lot of repetition and contradiction. And
sometimes it occurs in one passage, as in the flood story here, and
sometimes it occurs in stories or passages that are separate from one
another, for example, the two creation stories. There are many
significant differences between the two creation stories. They
different greatly in style. Genesis 1 is formalized, it's highly
structured, it has the seven days and everything's paired up. It's
beautifully structured, it's very abstract. Genesis 2 is much more
dramatic, much more earthy. The first creation story doesn't really
contain puns and wordplays, it's a little bit serious. The second
creation story is full of them: there are all sorts of little ironies
and puns in the Hebrew. <i>Adam</i>, the earthling made from the earth.
<i>Adam</i> is made from <i>adamah</i>. Adam and Eve are naked,
<i>arum</i>, which is the same word for clever or shrewd, and the snake
is <i>arum</i>, he's clever and shrewd: there are lots of little puns
of this kind.</p>

<p>There are also differences in terminology between the two stories.
Genesis 1 speaks of male and female, one set of Hebrew terms, but
Genesis 2 uses man and woman, a different set of Hebrew terms to
describe the genders. So the terms for gender are different in the two
stories.</p>

<p>Genesis 1 refers to God, as in your translation "God," Elohim, the
word that's translated as "God." He's remote, he's transcendent. He
creates effortlessly through his word and through his will. But Genesis
2 refers to the deity as a name that's really a combination, it's
Yahweh Elohim, so you'll see '"Lord God" right? You see that a lot in
the Bible as well, Lord God. That tells you both of those words were
side by side in the original Hebrew. So in Genesis 2 the deity is
Yahweh Elohim. He's much more down to earth. He forms the human like a
potter working with clay. He talks to himself, he plants a garden, he
takes a stroll in the garden in the cool of the evening. He makes
clothes for Adam and Eve. He's spoken of in much more anthropomorphic
terms then the God that we encounter in Genesis 1.</p>

<p>So what we have in the first few chapters of Genesis are two
creation stories that have distinctive styles, distinctive themes,
distinctive vocabularies and they're placed side by side. In Genesis 6
through 9 we seem to have two flood stories with distinctive styles,
and themes, and vocabularies, and substantive details, but they're
interwoven instead of being placed side by side. And there are many
such doublets in the Bible.</p>

<p>At times we have whole books that repeat or go over the same
material. In fact the whole historical saga that's recorded from
Genesis through the end of 2 Kings is rehearsed again in the books of
First and Second Chronicles. What are we to make of the repetitions and
the contradictions here and throughout the Bible? What are the
implications?</p>

<p>Suppose you came across a piece of writing that you knew nothing
about just lying there on the table. You didn't know who wrote it,
where, when, how, why, and someone says to you, "I want you to draw
some conclusions about that piece of writing. I want you to draw some
conclusions about its authorship and the way it was compiled or
composed." And so you pick it up and you start reading and you notice
features like this. What might you conclude? Throw it out, what might
you conclude? No presuppositions. You pick up the work and you find
these features. What might you conclude about its authorship or manner
of composition?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> There are multiple authors.</p>

<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes</b>: You might conclude that there are
multiple authors. Right? Multiple authorship. Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> There are revisions.</p>

<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes</b>: That revisions may have been made,
so that you might have different sources that have been revised or put
together in different ways. Right? Revisions implying that you've got
something and then it's worked over again, additions might be made so
now that's a new source. You might conclude that these features are
evidence of multiple authorship; a good deal of revision which points
itself to a kind of composite structure, different layers maybe,
different sources.</p>

<p>Well as early as the Middle Ages there were some scholars who
noticed these things in the biblical texts. They noticed that there are
contradictions and repetitions and there are anachronisms too, other
features that were evidence of multiple authorship, revisions and
composite structure. So what? Why would that be a big deal?</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> [inaudible]</p>

<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes</b>: Okay, it could be a bit of a
problem if this text has become the basis for a system of religious
faith or belief, and your assumptions about it are that its telling a
truth that is singular in nature. And also what about the traditional
beliefs on the origin of this text? Right, who wrote this text
according to traditional beliefs? [inaudible comments from audience]
I'm hearing Moses, I'm hearing God, I'm hearing a bunch of different
things, but there are traditional ideas about generally the Mosaic
authorship of the Bible, certainly the first five books of the
Bible.</p>

<p>And so these features of the text which were noticed were a
challenge to traditional religious convictions regarding the Mosaic
authorship of the first five books of the Bible, and in many ways the
perfection of the Bible, as speaking with a unified voice on matters of
doctrine or religious theology. So medieval commentators for example
began to speak a little bit more openly about some of these features.
One of the first things they noticed is that Deuteronomy 34 describes
the death and burial of Moses. So they decided it was possible that
Moses didn't write at least that chapter.</p>

<p>Similarly there are some anachronisms that they had to explain. One
of the most famous is in Genesis 13:7. It's in the midst of a story
about dividing the land between Lot and--at that time his name was
Abram, it later becomes Abraham--but between Lot and Abram. And the
narrator in telling this story sort of interjects and turns to us, the
readers, and says, "The Canaanites and Perrizites were then dwelling in
the land." Now what's weird about that sentence? The narrator is
speaking to us from a time in which the Canaanites and Perrizites don't
live in the land, right? "That's back when the Native Americans lived
in Connecticut." Is that writer living at a time when Native Americans
are still living in Connecticut or owning Connecticut? No. They're
writing from a later point of view. So the narrator breaks and talks to
the audience in Genesis 13:7 and says, "That was back in the time when
the Canaanites were in the land." When did Moses live? Who lived in the
land in the time of Moses? The Canaanites. I know you haven't gotten
there yet, but when you get to Deuteronomy you're going to find out he
doesn't make it into the land. So he never makes it in there, he never
gets in before the Israelites conquer. He dies--the Canaanites are
still in possession. So that line was certainly written not by Moses;
it was written by someone at a much later time who's looking back and
referring to the time when the Canaanites were in the land.</p>

<p>So these are the kinds of things that people began to notice. And
with the rise of rationalism in the modern period, traditional notions
of the divine and Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, the Torah, the
first five books of Moses, were called into question. The modern
critical study of the Bible begins really with Spinoza who in the early
seventeenth century suggested that the Bible should be studied and
examined like any book: without presuppositions about its divine origin
or any other dogmatic claims about its composition or authorship. But
it was a Catholic priest, Richard Simon, who first argued that Moses
didn't write the Torah, and that it contained many anachronisms and
errors.</p>

<p>Well we've run out of time, but I'll pick up this fascinating story
on Wednesday and we'll learn a little bit more about critical ideas
about the composition of the Bible. Please be on the look out for
emails from section leaders with study guides for sections which will
be meeting this week; you'll have a lot of fun with the creation
stories.</p>
