<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> When Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon
burned the temple and destroyed Jerusalem, the initial reaction was one
of overwhelming grief and sadness, and that's represented primarily in
the Book of Lamentations. It's a very short book of dirges that laments
the loss of Jerusalem as the death of a beloved person. And it's
traditionally attributed to Jeremiah. The Bible itself doesn't make
this claim; it's an old tradition.</p>

<p>It may have arisen, however, because of all of the prophets,
Jeremiah is the one who reveals the most to us about his personal
suffering and grief, and because he was present as an eyewitness at the
destruction. There's no real logical development of ideas in
Lamentations primarily because it's structured by an artificial device.
There are five chapters and four of the chapters are acrostic poems.
This means that each verse, or sometimes a series of verses, begins
with a letter of the alphabet in sequence. So in chapter 3 you have
three verses per letter of the alphabet. But this kind of acrostic
poetic formation gives the poem a kind of formal unity, at the same
time that it has no logical unity or logical flow. And it's been
pointed out that that form is particularly appropriate for an
expression of grief that is too profound or too all encompassing to be
logical.</p>

<p>The Lamentations over Jerusalem resemble very much David's
lamentations over Saul. The mourner spends time contrasting the former
splendor of the beloved to his or her present state. And we have lots
of Ancient Near Eastern prototypes for this kind of
lamentation--lamentations over destroyed cities which are understood as
the result of the deity's decision to abandon the city.</p>

<p>In Lamentations we're given a very detailed picture of the great
suffering that accompanied the final collapse. Lamentations 1:1:</p>

<blockquote>"Alas!<br />
 Lonely sits the city<br />
 Once great with people!<br />
 She that was great among nations<br />
 Is become like a widow;<br />
 The princess among states<br />
 Is become a thrall."</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Chapter 4:</p>

<blockquote>Alas!<br />
 The gold is dulled,<br />
 Debased the finest gold,<br />
 The sacred gems are spilled a<br />
 At every street corner.<br />
 The precious children of Zion;<br />
 Once valued as gold--<br />
 Alas, they are accounted as earthen pots,<br />
 Work of a potter's hands!<br />
 Even jackals offer the breast<br />
 And suckle their young;<br />
 But my poor people has turned cruel,<br />
 Like ostriches of the desert.<br />
 The tongue of the suckling cleaves<br />
 To its palate for thirst.<br />
 Little children beg for bread;<br />
 None give them a morsel.<br />
 Those who feasted on dainties<br />
 Lie famished in the streets;<br />
 Those who were reared in purple<br />
 Have embraced refuse heaps.<br />
 The guilt of my poor people<br />
 Exceeded the iniquity of Sodom,<br />
 Which was overthrown in a moment,<br />
 Without a hand striking it.<br />
 Her elect were purer then snow,<br />
 Whiter then milk;<br />
 Their limbs were ruddier then coral,<br />
 Their bodies were like sapphire.<br />
 Again, the description of the physical beauty of the beloved,<br />
 Now their faces are blacker then soot,<br />
 They are not recognized in the streets;<br />
 Their skin has shriveled on their bones,<br />
 It has become dry as wood.<br />
 Better off were the slain of the sword<br />
 Than those slain by famine,<br />
 Who pined away, [as though] wounded,<br />
 For lack of the fruits of the field.<br />
 With their own hands, tenderhearted women<br />
 Have cooked their children;<br />
 Such became their fare,<br />
 In the disaster of my poor people.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>The poet here, though, does adopt the standard Deuteronomistic
interpretation of events which infers sin from suffering, and
therefore, harps on the sin and the uncleanness of Jerusalem that
brought on this calamity. Their guilt exceeded the iniquity of Sodom in
the passage we just read, and this is a strategy that of course
justifies God. The poet singles out the corrupt priests, the corrupt
prophets for blame. He attacks the popular ideology of the
inviolability of Zion. Israel's many sins are what caused Yahweh to
pour out his wrath and destroy Jerusalem utterly.</p>

<p>The descriptions of Yahweh's wrath, anger, his consuming rage, these
are some of the most powerful and most violent poetry in the Hebrew
Bible. They tend to divert attention, in fact, from the people's guilt
and focus attention on their suffering. Children crying for bread,
children starving to death, women raped, men abused. In chapter 3, the
poet switches into the first person so Jerusalem is speaking like one
who is pursued and abused, beaten by an angry and violent master.</p>

<p>Chapter 3 [vv 1-11]:</p>

<blockquote>I am the man who has known affliction<br />
 Under the rod of His wrath;<br />
 Me he drove on and on<br />
 In unrelieved darkness;<br />
 On none but me He brings down His hand<br />
 Again and again, without cease.<br />
 He has worn away my flesh and skin;<br />
 He has shattered my bones.<br />
 All around me He has built<br />
 Misery and hardship;<br />
 He has made me dwell in darkness,<br />
 Like those long dead.<br />
 He has walled me in and I cannot break out;<br />
 He has weighed me down with chains.<br />
 And when I cry and plead,<br />
 He shuts out my prayer;<br />
 He has walled in my ways with hewn blocks,<br />
 He has made my paths a maze.<br />
 He is a lurking bear to me,<br />
 A lion in hiding;<br />
 He has forced me off my way and mangled me,<br />
 He has left me numb.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>A remarkably violent passage. And in another remarkable passage, the
poet describes God as refusing to hear the prayers of Israel. He no
longer can forgive. He simply has to punish. This is in chapter 3 as
well, verses 42 to 45.</p>

<blockquote>We have transgressed and rebelled,<br />
 And You have not forgiven.<br />
 You have clothed Yourself in anger and pursued us,<br />
 You have slain without pity.<br />
 You have screened Yourself off with a cloud<br />
 That no prayer may pass through.<br />
 You have made us filth and refuse<br />
 In the midst of the peoples.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>So God is simply refusing to even hear Israel's prayer. This is an
emphasis not so much on Israel's guilt, but on Israel's tremendous
suffering, God's hardheartedness.</p>

<p>The poem ends with a plea of reconciliation in 5:19-22.</p>

<blockquote>But You, O Lord, are enthroned forever,<br />
 Your throne endures through the ages.<br />
 Why have you forgotten us utterly,<br />
 Forsaken us for all time?<br />
 Take us back, O Lord, to Yourself,<br />
 And let us come back;<br />
 Renew our days as of old!<br />
 For truly, You have rejected us,<br />
 Bitterly raged against us.<br />
 Take us back, O Lord, to Yourself,<br />
 And let us come back;<br />
 Renew our days as of old!</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Lamentations represents one response to the fall of Jerusalem. It's
an overwhelming sense of loss, grief, misery, a sense of shock too at
God's treatment. And also a longing to return, a longing for renewal
and reconciliation. The 200 years following the destruction would prove
to be a time, a very critical time, of transition. And Israelite
literature in this period reflects the Israelites' struggle with the
philosophical and religious challenge of the destruction.</p>

<p>How could the disastrous events be explained? We've already seen the
response of the Deuteronomistic School. Israel was collectively
punished for idolatry. We've seen that history simply reflects justice
on a national and international level in this view. We've also seen the
response of Ezekiel. He promoted the idea of a continued relationship
with God in exile and was awaiting a fantastic restoration, a redesign
of human nature. We've seen the response of Second Isaiah which
emphasizes the universal significance of Israel's suffering, a
universal mission for Israel. For both Ezekiel and the author of Second
Isaiah, Israel's suffering is serving a purpose in the divine plan.
It's necessary. Israel needs purification and redemption and that will
prepare her for a new role in world history.</p>

<p>But there are other responses as well and they're found in the
material that's collected in the third section of the Hebrew Bible.
That's the section referred to really as <i>Ketuvim</i>, which in
Hebrew simply means writings, written things. It's sort of a
miscellany, a catch-all phrase. And the final portion of the course is
going to be devoted now to that third section. So Torah, <i>Neviim</i>
or prophets, and <i>Ketuvim</i>, or writings.</p>

<p>Next time I'm going to discuss the problem of dating many of the
works that are in this third section, the Writings. For now it'll
suffice to say that while some of the books in this third section of
the Bible may have pre-dated the exile, they became canonical, they
became authoritative for the community in the post-exilic period and
therefore served as a prism through which to view and come to grips
with Israel's history.</p>

<p>So we're going to turn today, first of all, to an examination of the
three books that represent the Wisdom tradition, what's referred to as
the Wisdom literature, or Wisdom tradition in ancient Israel. The
Wisdom books of the Hebrew Bible are Proverbs, Job, and
Ecclesiastes.</p>

<p>Israelite Wisdom literature belongs to a much wider and broad Wisdom
legacy or tradition in the Ancient Near East. There's very little in
biblical Wisdom literature apart from its monotheism that lacks a
parallel in the Wisdom literature of Egypt or Mesopotamia. So Ancient
Near Eastern Wisdom literature is literature that's characterized by a
praise of human intelligence, applied to understanding the ways of the
world, the ways of society. It tends to contain traditional
advice--advice that's been found to be tried and true. It tends to be
very individually oriented, but at the same time, quite universal and
humanistic in its orientation as well. In keeping with this style,
Israelite Wisdom literature doesn't really speak to the particular
historical condition of Israel. It speaks to the general human
condition. It makes no claim to having been divinely revealed--no
special claim to having been conveyed by a prophet or by Moses. It's
simply observational wisdom; advice and counsel that can be weighed or
confirmed or disputed by experience.</p>

<p>Again, if you were simply to open up the Book of Proverbs and read
something in there, unless it had the word Yahweh, you wouldn't know
that it didn't come from some Egyptian Wisdom literature, or
Mesopotamian Wisdom literature. There are various types of Wisdom
material. Scholars have classified the Wisdom material into three main
categories.</p>

<p>The Hebrew word for wisdom--which is the word
<i>hokhmah</i>--literally means skill and probably refers to the skill
of living well or living properly. The three types of Wisdom literature
that we find are what we could call (1) clan or family wisdom. These
materials tend to be common sense aphorisms and observations, the kinds
of things that are common to all cultures. They're scattered around the
Hebrew Bible, but most of them are contained in the Book of
Proverbs.</p>

<p>So, for example, Proverbs 15:17, "Better a meal of vegetables where
there is love / Then a fattened ox where there is hate." It's the kind
of thing you can imagine your grandmother saying. Chapter 20:14: "'Bad,
bad,' says the buyer, / But having moved off, he congratulates
himself." Or 26:14: "The door turns on its hinge, / And the lazy man on
his bed," and neither of them really gets anywhere. 25:25: "Like cold
water to a parched throat / Is good news from a distant land." Many of
the Proverbs we classify as clan or family wisdom are parental. They
tend to sound as if they're being said to a son, not so much a
daughter, but to a son.</p>

<p>The second category of Wisdom literature is what we call court
wisdom, and we have a lot of this from Egypt. A great deal of court
wisdom came from Egypt to serve the needs of the court. It tends to be
bureaucratic advice, administrative advice, career advice, instruction
on manners or tact, how to be diplomatic, how to live well and
prosper--practical wisdom.</p>

<p>So, for example, Proverbs 24:27, "Put your external affairs in
order, / Get ready what you have in the field, / Then build yourself a
home." Or 21:23: "He who guards his mouth and tongue / Guards himself
from trouble," [on] tact; 11:14, "For want of strategy an army falls, /
But victory comes with much planning," or 12:1, "He who loves
discipline loves knowledge; / He who spurns reproof is a brutish
man."</p>

<p>Then the third category of Wisdom literature is what we might call
more free-wheeling existential reflection or probing--a reflective
probing into the critical problems of human existence, and I'm going to
talk about that in much more detail as we get to the Book of Job.</p>

<p>Now as I mentioned before, all of these types of Wisdom literature
tend to be very universalistic, humanistic, ahistorical. There's
nothing particularly Israelite about them. There's no mention of the
exodus, there's no mention of Sinai or Moses or covenant or any of the
early narratives of the nation. And they [the Wisdom texts] are
paralleled in great abundance in the writings of other Ancient Near
Eastern cultures.</p>

<p>Sometimes there's an attempt to connect wisdom specifically with
belief in Yahweh. But biblical Wisdom like Ancient Near Eastern Wisdom
generally grounds morality on non-specific notions of prudence and
God-fearing in a sort of non-specific way, rather then on the
historical covenant with Yahweh.</p>

<p>So let's look at the Book of Proverbs in a little more detail.
Proverbs is the classic book of Wisdom. It contains some material of
great antiquity. Even though the book probably reached its final form
only in post-exilic times, surely a great deal of it is much older.
There are many affinities between Proverbs and Egyptian and Canaanite
Wisdom literature, so that suggests that Israel assimilated Wisdom
material from the wider environment.</p>

<p>The chief aim of Proverbs seems to be the inculcation of wisdom as
the means to social tranquility and a happy life. Young people should
learn to master their impulses. They should lead productive and
sensible lives. Many of the maxims are intended to educate sons,
there's no mention of daughters here, and a good deal of the first nine
chapters is formally pedagogical, clearly pedagogical, and can be
compared quite productively with some Egyptian writings that we have
from the third millennium--the Egyptian teaching of Amenemopet, or the
Babylonian Counsels of Wisdom; tremendous parallels among these works.
But these first nine chapters warn against the seductions of foreign
women and they urge young men to pursue wisdom. And wisdom here is
figured--almost hypostasized, an attribute or a characteristic that's
almost put into a concrete human form, wisdom is figured as a virtuous
woman who promises insight and counsel. This woman was created before
all other created things. And wisdom again, figured as a woman,
assisted Yahweh in the creation--in the ordering, I should say, the
ordering of the universe. Wisdom was with God at that time.</p>

<p>Proverbs values hard work and diligence, and warns against excessive
sleep and sex, and wine. Proverbs recommends honesty in your business
affairs and kindness, and loyalty, impartiality, sobriety, and
humility, restraint, and sincerity. Wealth is very nice, but it's not
to be desired at the cost of calmness and peace.</p>

<p>The Wisdom sayings that appear in Proverbs are usually these short
two-line sentences in which the second line runs parallel in some way
to the first. Some scholars have classified the different kinds of
parallelism you find in the book of Proverbs and I've written the three
main forms up here.</p>

<p>An example of synonymous parallelism, where the second line is
essentially synonymous with the first--that's found in Proverbs 22:1.
It's a classic feature of biblical poetry in general. We'll see it in
the Psalms. For an example, "A good name is to be chosen rather then
great riches / And favor," parallel to a good name, "is better then
silver and gold," parallel to great riches [RSV translation; see note
1]. So the two lines are somewhat synonymous.</p>

<p>In antithetic parallelism the two lines form a balanced pair of
opposites, so in Proverbs 10:1, "A wise son makes a glad father / But a
foolish son is a sorrow to his mother" [RSV translation].</p>

<p>When the second line seems to complete the thought of the first,
it's called ascending parallelism. We find that in Proverbs 11:22,
"Like a gold ring in the snout of a pig / Is a beautiful woman bereft
of sense." Another feature of Proverbs is that wisdom itself is
established as a religious concept. It seems to have some religious
value. Proverbs tries to link wisdom with reverence for God and
obedience to God.</p>

<p>In Proverbs 1:7, "The fear of the Lord" or reverence, "the fear of
the Lord is the beginning of wisdom [knowledge]. Fools despise wisdom
and discipline," or chapter 3:5-8, "Trust in the Lord with all your
heart, / And do not rely on your own understanding." Wisdom guards one
from evil, the wise person accepts the sufferings with which God is
disciplining him. So in Proverbs 3:12, "For Yahweh reproves," or
disciplines, "him whom he loves / As a father, the son in whom he
delights" [based on RSV translation].</p>

<p>Keep that in mind as we turn to Job, because I think the most
important thing about the Book of Proverbs is its almost smug certainty
that the righteous and the wicked of the world receive what they
deserve in this life. There's a complacency here, an optimism. God's
just providence and a moral world order, are presuppositions that it
just doesn't seem to question. The wise person's deeds are good and
will bring him happiness and success. The foolish person's deeds are
evil and they are going to lead to failure and ruin. The key idea is
that a truly wise person knows that the world is essentially coherent.
It's ethically ordered. There are clear laws of reward and punishment
that exist in the world.</p>

<p>Proverbs 26:27; "He who digs a pit will fall into it / and a stone
will come back upon him who starts it rolling" [RSV translation]. Or
13:6: "Righteousness protects him whose way is blameless; Wickedness
subverts the sinner." If the righteous suffer then they are being
chastised or chastened by God just as a son is disciplined by his
father. He shouldn't reject this reproof, he should welcome it.</p>

<p>This insistence, on the basic justice of the world, and the power of
wisdom or fear of the Lord to guarantee success and security was one
strand of ancient Israelite thought. It reaches crystallization in the
Book of Proverbs. It was available as a response to or an explanation
of the catastrophes that had befallen the nation. We've seen it at work
in the Deuteronomistic school, unwilling to relinquish the idea of a
moral God in control of history and preferring to infer the nation's
sinfulness from its suffering and calamity. Better to blame the
sufferer Israel and so keep God and the system of divine retributive
justice intact.</p>

<p>But it's precisely this formulaic and conventional piety that is
challenged by two other remarkable Wisdom books in the Bible: the Book
of Job and the Book of Ecclesiastes. In Job we find the idea that
suffering is not always punitive. It is not always a sign of
wickedness. It's not always explicable. And this is the first of
several subversions of fundamental biblical principles that we
encounter in the Book of Job.</p>

<p>The Book of Job--we really don't know its date. It's probably no
earlier then the sixth century BCE, but scholars disagree and there are
portions of it that seem to reflect a very old and very ancient
tradition. It's one of the hardest books of the Bible for moderns to
read, and I think that's because its conclusions--to the degree that we
can agree on what the conclusions might be--its conclusions seem to fly
in the face of some basic religious convictions.</p>

<p>You have to allow yourself, I think, to be surprised, to open your
mind, to allow yourself to take Job's charges against God seriously.
After all, the narrator makes it clear that God does take them
seriously. God nowhere denies Job's charges and, in fact, at one point
the narrator has God say that Job has spoken truly. So no matter how
uncomfortable Job may make you feel, you need to understand his claims
and not condemn him.</p>

<p>Job is going to attack the optimistic conventional piety that is
typified in the Book of Proverbs. He's going to challenge the
assumption that there is a moral world order. The issues that are
raised in this book are twofold: first, why God permits blatant
injustice and undeserved suffering and evil to exist in the world, and
second of all, whether people will be virtuous when they are afflicted
and suffering. In other words, are people righteous only because God
will reward them for it, or are they righteous because of the intrinsic
and inherent value of righteousness? Those are the two issues.</p>

<p>Now literarily, the book contains two primary elements. First, we
have a prose story and that provides a framework for the book, that's
chapters 1 and 2 and then it returns in chapter 42 at the end of the
book. Into this prose framework a large poetic section of dialogue and
speeches has been inserted.</p>

<p>So there are two main literary components. Now the prose framework
concerning a scrupulously righteous man named Job, afflicted by
horrendous calamity, was probably a standard Ancient Near Eastern
folktale of great antiquity. The story isn't set in Israel; it's not
about an Israelite. It's set in Edom. Job is an eastern magnate who
dwells in the country of Uz, not an Israelite. But the Israelite author
has used this older Ancient Near Eastern legend about a man named Job
for his own purposes.</p>

<p>The name Job, which in Hebrew is pronounced, <i>iyyov</i>, is
bivalent in meaning. It can mean "enemy" in Hebrew, by changing vowels
around; but it's the root for enemy, <i>oyev,</i> or, if we take it in
Aramaic, it can mean "one who repents," "a repentant one." And as we're
going to see, the name will be appropriate in both senses as the story
progresses.</p>

<p>There's a handout on the side of the room. I'm not sure everyone
took one when they came in. I'm wondering if it could be distributed
please. I'm sorry. It's going to help you chart what goes on in Job.
But this handout contains an outline of the book's structure on one
side--so it's mapped out on one side. On the other side, it has some
important verses and terms.</p>

<p>But we'll see from the outline of the structure, chapters 1 and 2
have this prose prologue about the pious and prosperous Job and his
devastation, which is the result of a challenge which is put to God. At
the end of that prologue, at the end of chapter 2, he has three friends
who come to sit with him in silence for seven days. The silence doesn't
last very long because we move then into the large poetic section and
that extends from chapter 3 all the way to chapter 42, verse 7. So
you'll see that structure on the handout. There are many ways to map
the structure of the Book of Job. Your handout charts, I think, one of
the more common and clearer representations.</p>

<p>Looking now specifically at the poetic section: First, you have a
dialogue between Job and his three friends that goes from chapter 3 to
chapter 31, verse40. And it can be divided into three cycles of
speeches. Job opens each cycle--so the first speech in each cycle is by
Job--and then his friends speak in a regular pattern. First, Eliphaz
with Job responding and then Bildad with Job responding and then
Zophar; and you have this pattern of six speeches. It occurs three
times but in fact the third time the reply by Zophar is omitted and
that deviation ensures that Job has the first and the last word. He has
a summation speech in chapters 29 to 31.</p>

<p>At first, the friends seek to comfort Job and to explain his
suffering but they become increasingly harsh, ultimately bearing a
callous contempt for Job's condition. Now this section closes with the
long speech by Job, as I said: 29 to 31. He's lamenting the loss of his
past, pleasant life. He protests his innocence, he calls on God to
answer.</p>

<p>But then Elihu, this previously unannounced fourth friend appears.
He gives four speeches from chapters32 to 37. He admonishes Job; he
defends God's justice, and then this is followed by a poetic discourse
between God who poses a series of rhetorical questions and Job who
appears contrite. And that section also falls into four parts rather
like Elihu's speech. You have two long speeches by Yahweh, two short
ones by Job.</p>

<p>Finally, there's a concluding prose epilogue that vindicates Job.
God criticizes Job's friends, and then in a rather unexpected happy
ending, we have Job restored to his fortunes and finally experiencing a
peaceful death.</p>

<p>So let's look at the contents in greater deal now that we've
reviewed the structure. The story opens by introducing us to Job. He's
said to be a blameless and upright man. He fears God and he shuns evil,
that is chapter 1, verse 1. So the moral virtue and innocence of Job is
established in the opening line as a narrative fact, a non-negotiable
narrative fact. And yet this Job is to become the victim of a challenge
issued by "the <i>satan</i>" in the heavenly counsel. I say "the satan"
deliberately. <i>The</i> satan. The satan is certainly not the devil.
There's no such notion in the Hebrew Bible. The phrase, "the satan,"
occurs four times in the Hebrew Bible, here and in Numbers 22 and in
Zechariah3.</p>

<p>"The <i>satan</i>" is simply a member of the divine counsel--one of
God's minions whose function it is to investigate affairs on earth and
to act as a kind of prosecuting attorney. He has to bring evildoers to
justice. And it's only in later Jewish, and especially Christian
thought, that the term loses the definite article--from "the
<i>satan</i>" which means "the prosecutor" essentially, the prosecuting
attorney--and becomes a proper name, Satan, for an enemy or opponent of
God.</p>

<p>This later concept of Satan develops as a means of explaining evil
without attributing it to God, but that isn't the function of the
<i>satan</i> here. He works for God and when Yahweh boasts of his pious
servant Job, the prosecuting angel wonders, as his portfolio requires
him to do, whether Job's piety is sincere. Perhaps he's motivated by
self-interest. Since he's been blessed with such good fortune and
prosperity he's naturally enough pious and righteous, but would his
piety survive affliction and suffering? Deprived of his wealth wouldn't
he curse God to his face? You have to notice as you're reading the
euphemistic use of "bless God" instead of "curse God." The ancient
writers did not want to write down "curse God" so they wrote "bless
God," but we need to understand that's a euphemistic way of avoiding
writing "curse God."</p>

<p>So wouldn't he curse God to his face? God is quite confident that
Job's piety is not superficial, it's not driven by the desire for
reward, and so he permits the <i>satan</i> to put Job to the test.
Job's children are killed, his cattle are destroyed, his property is
destroyed, but Job's response in chapter 1:21 is, "Naked I came from my
mother's womb and naked I shall return; God gives and God takes away,
may the name of the Lord be blessed [see note 2].</p>

<p>The narrator then adds in verse 22, "In all this--," and if you flip
over I've got some of these key verses on the back of your handout to
help you keep track, "In all this Job did not sin or impute anything
unsavory to God." And God again praises Job to the <i>satan</i>,
saying, "And still he holds on to his integrity, so you incited me to
destroy him for nothing." That's chapter 2:3. So the <i>satan</i>
proposes increasing the suffering, and God agrees on the condition that
Job's life be preserved.</p>

<p>So the <i>satan</i> strikes Job's body with these terrible painful
sores, trying to crush his spirit and Job's wife rages, "Do you still
hold on to your integrity? Bless God," curse God "and die," chapter
2:9. But still Job will not sin, he will not curse God, he insists on
remaining virtuous and he responds, "Shall we receive good at the hand
of God and shall we not receive evil?" [RSV translation]</p>

<p>So at first glance it would appear that Job accepts his bitter fate.
But note: after the first round of suffering, the narrator observed
that "in all this Job did not sin with his lips or impute anything
unsavory to God," but now he merely observes, "in all this Job did not
sin with his lips." Not with his lips perhaps, but in his heart did he
impute unsavory things to God?</p>

<p>If we were to move directly to the conclusion of the folktale in
chapter 42, if we jump from this point just to the conclusion, in 42:7
is where the conclusion begins, we would find that Job is rewarded
fully for his patience and steadfast loyalty and his household and his
belongings are restored to him twice over. The folktale standing alone
could be read as the story of an innocent man tested, who accepts his
fate. He retains his faith, and he's rewarded.</p>

<p>Standing alone, the tale appears to reflect the values and the
conventional piety of the Wisdom literature and of the Deuteronomistic
school. But the folktale doesn't stand alone. The anonymous author of
Job uses this earlier legend concerning the righteous man Job as a
frame for his own purposes, and the hint at the end of the prologue
that Job perhaps is beginning to impute unsavory things to God points
forward to this extensive poetic dialogue that's following.</p>

<p>Here are Job's unsavory accusations against God. Here we have a most
impatient and furious Job who will charge God with gross mismanagement
of the world and eventually deny the existence of a moral order
altogether. So reading the Book of Job is a fascinating exercise
because the two types of material in the book, the prose frame and the
poetic dialogue in the middle, they appear to be in tension. And yet
interwoven, as they are now, they work together and the one shapes our
reading of the other.</p>

<p>Our reception of the accusations of Job's friends in the poetic
dialogue--our reception of those words is determined by the prose
framework's assertion that Job is innocent. That's a non-negotiable
narrative fact and because of the fact of Job's righteousness, we know
Job's friends are lying when they say Job must be suffering for some
hidden sin. And we know that Job's self-defense, that he hasn't
deserved the suffering is correct.</p>

<p>We're going to rehearse some of the arguments that are advanced in
the central core, the poetic core of the book, and here I think a
helpful guide through the arguments--there are lots of commentaries on
the Book of Job, but one commentary that I think is helpful in just
sort of working through some of the arguments of the interlocutors is
the analysis of Edwin Good [see note 3].</p>

<p>Although Job doesn't exactly curse God in his first speech, he does
curse the day of his birth. And in a passage that alludes repeatedly to
creation, Job essentially curses all that God has accomplished as
creator of the cosmos. He wishes he were dead, and at this point he
doesn't even ask why this has happened to him, he only asks why he
should be alive when he prefers death.</p>

<p>Eliphaz's reply is long and elaborate. He seems to offer comfort. He
<i>seems</i> to offer comfort, until he injects a new element in the
discussion and that's the element of justice. Job hasn't mentioned the
issue of justice up to this point, but Eliphaz says, "Think now, what
innocent man ever perished? / Where have the upright been destroyed? /
As I have seen, those who plow evil / And sow mischief reap them,"
chapter 4:7-8.</p>

<p>So Eliphaz is handing Job the standard line of biblical Wisdom
literature as exemplified by something like the book of Proverbs,
belief in a system of divine retributive justice--that retribution is
just. By definition there can be no undeserved suffering. The
implication is that Job has deserved this suffering--a thought that
apparently hadn't occurred to Job--and the question of undeserved
suffering is now going to dominate the rest of the discussion.</p>

<p>Job's second speech is very disorderly. It's full of wildly
contradictory images that may reflect the shock and the pain and the
rage that now overwhelm him. He seems to be haunted by Eliphaz's
connection of his suffering with some sin and so he turns to address
God directly. He admits he's not perfect but surely, he objects, he
doesn't deserve such affliction.</p>

<p>In chapter 8 we have Bildad's speech and it's tactless and unkind.
He says, "Will God pervert the right? / Will the Almighty pervert
justice? / If your sons sinned against Him, / He dispatched them for
their transgressions," 8:3-4 [JPS translation]. In other words, God is
perfectly just and ultimately all get what they deserve. Indeed, your
children, Job, must have died because they sinned, so just search for
God and ask for mercy.</p>

<p>The friends' speeches lead Job to the conclusion that God must be
indifferent to moral status. God doesn't follow the rules that he
demands of human beings. This is chapter 9:22, "He finishes off both
perfect and wicked." When Job complains, "He wounds me much for
nothing," chapter 9:17, he's echoing God's own words to the
<i>satan</i> in the prologue. Remember when God says to the
<i>satan</i> you have "incited me to destroy him for nothing," and we
suspect by this verbal coincidence that Job is right.</p>

<p>Legal terms dominate, as Job calls for the charges against him to be
published, and then he hurls countercharges in a suit against God.
Charges of unworthy conduct, of spurning his creatures while smiling on
the wicked, on scrutinizing Job even though he knows Job to be
innocent, and this too is a subversion of a common prophetic literary
genre that we've seen: the <i>riv</i> or the covenant lawsuit in which
God through his prophets charges Israel with flagrant violation of the
terms of the covenant and warns of inevitable punishment.</p>

<p>Here, in Job, it's a man who arraigns God and yet, Job asserts,
since God is God and not a human adversary, there's really no fair way
for the lawsuit between them to be tried or arbitrated. "Man cannot win
a suit against God," chapter 9:2. Job is powerless in the face of this
injustice.</p>

<p>These ideas all find expression in Job 10:1-7 [JPS translation]:</p>

<blockquote>I am disgusted with life;<br />
 I will give rein to my complaint,<br />
 Speak in the bitterness of my soul.<br />
 I say to God, "Do not condemn men;<br />
 Let me know what You charge me with.<br />
 Does it benefit You to defraud,<br />
 To despise the toil of Your hands,<br />
 While smiling on the counsel of the wicked?<br />
 Do You have the eyes of flesh?<br />
 Is Your vision that of mere men?<br />
 Are Your days the days of a mortal?<br />
 Are Your years the years of a man,<br />
 That You seek my inequity<br />
 And search out my sin?<br />
 You know that I am not guilty,<br />
 And that there is none to deliver from Your hand…</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Job repeats his wish to die, this time less because of his suffering
and more because his worldview has collapsed. He sees that divine power
is utterly divorced from justice and that's a second fundamental
biblical assumption subverted.</p>

<p>But Job's words only seem to egg his interlocutors on. Eliphaz had
implied that Job was a sinner. Bildad had baldly asserted that his sons
had died for their sins and now Zophar's going to claim that actually
Job is suffering less then he deserves. And Job isn't persuaded. He
isn't persuaded that he has sinned or more precisely, that he has
sinned in proportion to the punishment he is now suffering. God is
simply unjust. The Job of this poetic dialogue portion of the book is
hardly patient or pious. He is angry, he is violent, he argues, he
complains and vehemently insists upon his innocence.</p>

<p>In the fourth speech by Job--now this is the speech that opens the
second cycle of speeches--Job appeals to creation. God's controlling
power is arbitrary and unprincipled. He interferes with the natural
order, he interferes with the human order, and this is itself a
subversion of the Genesis portrait of creation as a process whose goal
and crown is humankind. Again, Job demands a trial. He demands a trial
in the widely quoted and mistranslated verse--this is Job 13:15: "He
may well slay me. I may have no hope-- but I must argue my case before
Him." In other words, Job knows that he can't win but he still wants
his day in court. He wants to make his accusation of God's
mismanagement. He wants to voice his protest even though he knows it
will gain him nothing.</p>

<p>In a pun on his name, <i>Iyyov</i>, Job asks God, "Why do You hide
Your face, / And treat me like an enemy?" ,treat me like an
<i>oyev</i>, 13:28 [correction: chapter 13:24; JPS translation]. In his
second speech Job fully expects to be murdered, not executed, but
murdered by God and hopes only that the evidence of his murder will not
be concealed he says in 16:18, "Earth, do not cover my blood" [JPS
translation].</p>

<p>Job's third speech reiterates this desire, the desire that the wrong
against him not be forgotten. "Would that my words were written, would
that they were engraved in an inscription, with an iron stylus and
lead, forever in rock they were incised," 19:23-24.</p>

<p>Job's three speeches in the second cycle become increasingly
emotional and for their part the speeches of his friends in this cycle
become increasingly cruel. Their insistence that suffering is always a
sure sign of sin seems to justify hostility towards and contempt for
Job. He's now depicted as universally mocked and humiliated and
despised and abused. One cannot help but see in this characterization
of Job's so-called friends, an incisive commentary on the callous human
propensity to blame the victim, and to do so lest our tidy and
comfortable picture of a moral universe in which the righteous do not
suffer, should come apart at the seams as Job's has.</p>

<p>Job opens the third cycle of speeches urging his friends to look, to
really see his situation, because if they did they would be appalled.
Job's situation looked at honestly requires the admission that God has
done this for no reason and that the friends' understanding of the
world is a lie. Job asserts baldly: there is no distributive justice,
there's no coherent or orderly system of morality in this life or any
other. There is no principle of afterlife, after all, in the Hebrew
Bible.</p>

<p>Chapter 21:7-26 [JPS translation]:</p>

<blockquote>Why do the wicked live on,<br />
 Prosper and grow wealthy?<br />
 Their children are with them always,<br />
 And they see their children's children.<br />
 Their homes are secure, without fear;<br />
 They do not feel the rod of God.<br />
 …their children skip about.<br />
 They sing to the music of timbrel and lute,<br />
 And revel to the tune of the pipe;<br />
 They spend their days in happiness,<br />
 And go down to Sheol in peace.<br />
 …How seldom does the lamp of the wicked fail,<br />
 Does the calamity they deserve befall them?<br />
 …[You say,] "God is reserving his punishment for his sons";<br />
 Let it be paid back to Him that He may feel it,<br />
 ...One man dies in robust health,<br />
 All tranquil and untroubled;<br />
 His pails are full of milk;<br />
 The marrow of his bones is juicy.<br />
 Another dies embittered,<br />
 Never having tasted happiness.<br />
 They both lie in the dust<br />
 And are covered with worms.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>But the friends can't look honestly at Job; they can't allow that,
indeed, a righteous man suffers horribly.</p>

<p>By the end of the third cycle Job is ready and eager for his trial,
but he can't find God. Job's final speech in the third cycle focuses on
this theme of divine absence. God is irresponsibly absent from the
world and the result is human wickedness. So from the idea that God is
morally neutral or indifferent, Job has moved to the implicit charge
that God is responsible for wickedness. He rewards wickedness; he
causes wickedness by his absence, his failure to govern properly. He is
both corrupt and a corrupter of others. "If it is not so, he says, who
will prove me a liar and bring my words to nought."</p>

<p>Yet, even in the depths of his anguish, and even though he is now
convinced that God does not enforce a moral law in the universe, Job
clings to one value: righteousness is a virtue in and of itself, and
even if it brings no reward Job will not give up his righteousness.
Face to face with the shocking insight that good and evil are met with
indifference by God, that righteousness brings no reward and wickedness
no punishment, Job although bitter, refuses to succumb to a moral
nihilism. Chapter 27:2-6:</p>

<blockquote>By God who has deprived me of justice!<br />
 By Shaddai who has embittered my life!<br />
 As long as there is life in me,<br />
 And God's breath is in my nostrils,<br />
 My lips will speak no wrong,<br />
 Nor my tongue utter deceit.<br />
 Far be it for me to say that you are right;<br />
 Until I die I will maintain my integrity.<br />
 I persist in my righteousness and will not yield;<br />
 I shall be free of reproach as long as I live.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>These last lines recall the words of God and the <i>satan</i> in the
prelude. The <i>satan</i> had said that a man will not hold on to
virtue or to righteousness in the face of suffering. He'll give
everything away for his life. So this narrative set-up guides or
influences our interpretation of Job's statement here. Although he is
losing his life, Job says he will not give anything away but he holds
onto, he maintains his integrity just as God had scolded the
<i>satan</i> in chapter 2:3 which reads, "Still he holds onto his
integrity. You have incited me to destroy him for nothing."</p>

<p>So in his darkest, most bitter hour with all hope of reward gone,
Job clings to the one thing he has--his own righteousness. In fact,
when all hope of just reward is gone then righteousness becomes an
intrinsic value. Yehezkel Kaufman writes of this moment, "the poet
raises Job to the bleak summit of righteousness bereft of hope, bereft
of faith in divine justice" [see note 4].</p>

<p>Or in the words of another scholar, Moshe Greenberg, we see here</p>

<blockquote>..the sheer heroism of a naked man, forsaken by his God and
his friends and bereft of a clue to understand his suffering, still
maintaining faith in the value of his virtue and in the absolute duty
of man to be virtuous. The universe has turned its back on him. We may
add he believes God has turned his back on him--yet Job persists in the
affirmation of his own worth and the transcendent worth of unrewarded
good [Greenberg 1987, 285].</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So in a way then, for all their differences in style and manner, the
patient Job of the legend and the raging Job of the poetic dialogue,
are basically the same man. Each ultimately remains firm in his moral
character, clinging to righteousness because of its intrinsic value and
not because it will be rewarded. Indeed, Job knows bitterly that it
will not.</p>

<p>At the end of his outburst, Job sues God. He issues Him a summons
and he demands that God reveal to him the reason for his suffering. Job
pronounces a series of curses to clear himself from the accusations
against him, specifying the sins he has not committed and ending, as he
began, in chapter 3, with a curse on the day of his birth.</p>

<p>We expect to hear from God now but instead we hear from an
unannounced stranger, Elihu. I'm going to have to give Elihu short
shrift. He's the only one of the four interlocutors to refer to Job by
name, address Job by name. He repeats many of the trite assertions of
Job's friends. He does hint, however, that not all suffering is
punitive. He also hints that contemplation of nature's elements can
open the mind to a new awareness of God and in these two respects,
Elihu's speech moves us towards God's answer from the storm.</p>

<p>So in the climatic moment, God answers Job in an extraordinary
theophany, or self-manifestation. In chapter 38 God speaks out of the
tempest or whirlwind, "Who is this who darkens counsel, speaking
without knowledge," is he referring to Job, to Elihu, the three
friends, all of them? God has heard enough, it's his turn to ask
questions, the answers to which are clearly implied; these are
rhetorical questions.</p>

<blockquote>Where were you when I laid the earth's foundations?<br />
 Speak if you have understanding.<br />
 Do you know who fixed its dimensions<br />
 Or who measured it with a line?"<br />
You did, God.<br />
 …Have you ever commanded the day to break,<br />
 Assigned the dawn its place,<br />
 …Have you penetrated to the sources of the sea,<br />
 Or walked in the recesses of the deep?</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>No, no human has. And God continues with these rhetorical questions,
questions regarding the animals, their various powers and attributes,
but one wonders what the purpose of all these questions is.</p>

<p>One senses that they are irrelevant. Job has posed some very
specific challenges to God. Why am I suffering? Is there a pattern to
existence? Is God's refusal to answer these challenges a way of saying
there is no answer? Or is it God's way of saying that justice is beyond
human understanding? Or is this theophany of God in nature and the
focus on creation, an implicit assault on the fundamental tenant of
Israelite religion that God is known and made manifest through his
interactions with humans, his rewards and punishments in historical
time.</p>

<p>You'll recall that the monotheistic revolution is generally
understood to have effected a break from mythological conceptions of
the gods as indistinguishable from various natural forces, limited by
meta-divine powers and forces of the cosmos.</p>

<p>The biblical God wasn't another Ancient Near Eastern or Canaanite
nature God ultimately, but a wholly transcendent power--He was figured
this way in many parts of the Bible--known not through the involuntary
and recurring cycles of nature but through His freely willed and
non-repeating actions in historical time. Such a view of God
underwrites the whole system of divine retributive justice.</p>

<p>Only an essentially good God who transcends and is unconstrained by
mechanistic natural forces can establish and administer a system of
retributive justice, dealing out punishment and reward in response to
the actions of humans in time.</p>

<p>Is the author of Job suggesting that history and the events that
befall the just and the unjust are not the medium of revelation? Is God
a god of nature after all, encountered in the repeating cycles of the
natural world and not in the unpredictable and incoherent arena of
human history and action? If so, then this is a third fundamental
biblical assumption that has been radically subverted.</p>

<p>So we'll turn now to God's direct speech to Job in 40:8, 40, verse
8, excuse me. "Would you impugn my justice? / Would you condemn Me that
you be right?" God, I think, is now getting at the heart of the matter:
your friends Job were wrong, they condemned you. They attributed sin to
you, so that they might be right. But you, too, have been wrong
condemning Me, attributing wickedness to Me so that you might be
right.</p>

<p>Job's friends erred because they assumed that there's a system of
retributive justice at work in the world and that assumption led them
to infer that all who suffer are sinful, and that's a blatant
falsehood. But Job also errs; if he assumes that although there isn't a
system of retributive justice, there really ought to be one. It's that
assumption that leads him to infer that suffering is a sign of an
indifferent or wicked God, and that is equally a falsehood. Job needs
to move beyond the anthropocentrism that characterizes the rest of
Scripture and the Genesis 1 account of creation, according to which
humankind is the goal of the entire process of creation.</p>

<p>God's creation, the Book of Job seems to suggest, defies such
teleological and rational categories. In a nutshell, God refuses to be
seen as a moral accountant. The idea of God as a moral accountant is
responsible for two major errors: the interpretation of suffering as an
indicator of sin, or the ascription of injustice to God. In his final
speech, Job confesses to a new firsthand knowledge of God that he
lacked before, and as a result of this knowledge Job repents,
"Therefore, I recant and relent, / Being but dust and ashes," 42:6.</p>

<p>Here we see the other meaning of Job's name, "one who repents,"
suddenly leap to the fore. What is he repenting of? Certainly not of
sin; God has not upheld the accusations against Job. Indeed he states
explicitly in a moment that the friends were wrong to say he had
sinned. But he has indicated that guilt and innocence, reward and
punishment are not what the game is all about, and while Job had long
been disabused of the notion that the wicked and the righteous actually
get what they deserve, he nevertheless had clung to the idea that
ideally they should. And it's that mistaken idea--the idea that led him
to ascribe wickedness to God--that Job now recants. With this new
understanding of God, Job is liberated from what he would now see as a
false expectation raised by the Deuteronomistic notion of a covenant
relationship between God and humankind, enforced by a system of divine
justice.</p>

<p>At the end of the story Job is fully restored to his fortunes. God
asserts he did no evil and the conventional, impeccably Deuteronomistic
view of the three friends is clearly denounced by God. He says of them,
"They have not spoken of Me what is right as my servant Job has," 42:7.
For some, the happy ending seems anticlimactic, a capitulation to the
demand for a happy ending of just desserts that runs counter to the
whole thrust of the book, and yet in a way I think the ending is
superbly fitting. It's the last in a series of reversals that subverts
our expectations. Suffering comes inexplicably, so does restoration;
blessed be the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>God doesn't attempt to justify or explain Job's suffering and yet
somehow by the end of the book, our grumbling, embittered, raging Job
is satisfied. Perhaps he's realized that an automatic principle of
reward and punishment would make it impossible for humans to do the
good for purely disinterested motives. It's precisely when
righteousness is seen to be absurd and meaningless that the choice to
be righteous paradoxically becomes meaningful. God and Job, however we
are to interpret their speeches, are reconciled.</p>

<p>The suffering and injustice that characterize the world have baffled
humankind for millennia. And the Book of Job provides no answer in the
sense of an explanation or a justification of suffering and injustice,
but what it does offer is a stern warning to avoid the Scylla of
blaspheming against the victims by assuming their wickedness, and the
Charybdis of blaspheming against God by assuming his. Nor is moral
nihilism an option, as our hero, yearning for, but ultimately
renouncing divine order and justice, clings to his integrity and
chooses virtue for nothing.</p>
