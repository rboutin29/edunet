<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> We were talking last time about
evidence of the use of different sources in the biblical text, and I
mentioned Richard Simon, who was the first to argue that perhaps Moses
wasn't the author of the entire Torah. In the mid-eighteenth century a
fellow named Jean Astruc first noticed the use of the name Yahweh in
certain stories and passages, and the name Elohim in others. And on
this basis he came, and others came, to identify what have come to be
known as the J and E sources. J being pronounced "y" in German, as a
"Y," so Yahweh is spelt with a "J". So the J and the E sources. Now
Astruc actually happened to maintain the idea of Mosaic authorship. He
argued the Moses was drawing from two separate long documents, which he
identified as J and E. They used different names for God, and he was
drawing on those in his composition of the Torah. But in the next
century his work would be expanded by Germans who identified other
sources that made up the Pentateuch especially, the first five books of
the Bible especially.</p>

<p>And in 1878 we have the classic statement of biblical source theory
published by Julius Wellhausen. He wrote a work called <i>The History
of Israel</i>, and he presented what is known as the Documentary
Hypothesis. Now you've read a little bit about this in your source
readings, but it's the hypothesis that the historical or narrative
sections of the Bible--Genesis and stretching on really through 2
Kings--is comprised of four identifiable source documents that have
been woven together in some way. And he argued that these documents
date to different periods and reflect very different interests and
concerns. These four prior documents, he says, were woven together by
somebody or some group of somebodies to form the narrative core of the
Bible.</p>

<p>Wellhausen argued that these sources therefore do not tell us about
the times or situations they purport to describe, so much as they tell
us about the beliefs and practices of Israelites in the period in which
they were composed. This is going to be an important claim; this is an
important predicate of the documentary hypothesis. So although the
sources claim to talk about events from creation, actually, forward,
Wellhausen says, no, they really can only be used to tell us about the
beliefs and religion of Israel from the tenth century, which is when he
thinks the oldest was written, and forward.</p>

<p>Now his work created a sensation. It undermined of course
traditional claims about the authorship of God and the work of Moses.
It's still disputed by conservative groups and Roman Catholic
authorities, although Roman Catholic scholars certainly teach it and
adopt it.</p>

<p>The four sources that were identified by Wellhausen are, as I said,
the J source and the E source, but also P, the priestly source, and D,
which is primarily the book of Deuteronomy. Now as I said the first two
sources are named because of the names of God that they employ, but it
goes a little deeper then that. According to J, the knowledge of the
proper or personal name, if you will, of God, Yahweh, begins with the
first human, with the <i>adam</i>. So already in Genesis 4, <i>adam</i>
seems to know this name and refer to God by this name. If we look at
other sources such as P and even E, Yahweh's name is not known to
humankind until he chooses to reveal it to Moses, and this happens in
the time of the Exodus. So in Exodus 6:2-3, which is assigned by source
critics to the P source, the Priestly source, God appears to Moses and
he tells Moses then that he is Yahweh. He says, "I appeared to Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob," the patriarchs before you, "as El Shaddai, but I did
not make myself known to them by name, Yahweh." So the P source has a
different sort of theology, if you will, of God's name, or the
revelation of God's name. And the same sort of thing happens in Exodus
3:13-16, and that's assigned to the E source.</p>

<p>So once you've identified rough blocks of material according to not
just the name of the deity but also their assumptions about when
humankind knows the name of the deity, then you can analyze these
blocks or chunks of text and begin to identify certain characteristic
features: their style, the terminology they use. Source critics were
able to come up with a list of what they believed were the main
characteristics of the various sources. So the main characteristics of
the J source, which begins with the second creation story, so the J
source picks up in Genesis 2:4, second half of verse 4 are: (1) that it
uses a personal name Yahweh for God from the time of creation, and that
will be in your Bibles as "Lord"; (2) It describes God very
anthropomorphically. It's the J source that has God shut the door of
the ark after Noah. It's the J source that has God smelling the
sacrifice after the Flood, the sacrifice that Noah offers. It's in the
J source that God eats with Abraham and bargains with him. It's in the
J source that God meets with Moses in this mysterious passage and tries
to kill him one night; (3) J has a very vivid and concrete earthy
style; and, (4) It uses the name Mount Sinai to refer to the place
where the Israelites with Moses will conclude the covenant with
God.</p>

<p>As for the date? Well source critics felt that a clue to the dating
of the J source could be found in the passage in which God promises a
grant of national land to the Israelites. The boundaries of the land
are given there as the River of Egypt, the Nile, and the Euphrates. It
was argued by some that those were basically the borders of the Kingdom
of Israel under David and Solomon. Think of 1000 as your date for
David, that's basically when the monarchy begins. So the beginning of
the tenth century. The argument is that under David and Solomon the
empire reached that boundary and so clearly this is a writer from the
tenth century who's seeking to justify Israel's possession of its
kingdom from the River of Egypt to the Euphrates; it's presenting that
kingdom as a fulfillment of a promise of land that God made to Israel's
ancient ancestors. For that reason source critics thought J must date
to about the tenth century and to the time of perhaps King Solomon.</p>

<p>It also seems to reflect the interests of the south. Remember, we
talked about the fact briefly that at a certain point in Israel's
history there is a division upon the death of Solomon in the late tenth
century. The kingdom divides into a northern kingdom now called Israel
and a southern smaller kingdom called Judah. And the southern interests
seem to be reflected in the J document. So source critics decided this
is a Judean document from the tenth century.</p>

<p>The E source, which source critics say begins around Genesis 15 is
really the most fragmentary. It seems to have been used to supplement
the J source rather than being used in a larger form. So sometimes it
seems very difficult to isolate, and there's a lot of debate over this,
but the E source's characteristics are that (1) it uses Elohim, again
it's a plural form of the word god or gods, but when it's used with a
singular verb it refers to the God of Israel; (2) it has a much less
anthropomorphic view of God; (3) God is more remote. There aren't the
direct face-to-face revelations in the E source; most communications
from the divine are indirect. They'll be through messengers or dreams
and; (4) there's also an emphasis on prophets and prophecy in the E
source. Miriam, Moses--they're both referred to as prophets in the E
source; (5) The style is more abstract, a little less picturesque, and;
(6) the E source uses a different name for the mountain where the
covenant was concluded. It uses the name Horeb. So you will sometimes
see as you are reading the text, they will sometimes refer to Horeb
instead of Mount Sinai, or you'll see the two names used
interchangeably. And it's been the theory of scholars that that's
because it comes from a different source.</p>

<p>The E source seems to be concerned primarily with the northern
tribes, therefore the northern kingdom. And so source theorists decided
that it was most likely composed in the northern kingdoms about the
ninth century.</p>

<p>And then, according to this hypothesis, the J and E sources were
combined, primarily J with E being used to supplement it, probably
somewhere in the eight century, late eighth century; and that was the
backbone of the Pentateuchal narrative. It covers the early history of
humankind, of Israel's early ancestors known as the patriarchs and
matriarchs. Their stories are told in Genesis. It contained the story
of Moses and the exodus from Egypt in the book of Exodus, and the
stories of the wandering in the wilderness that are found in the book
of Numbers. The anonymous scribe or editor who combined these sources
didn't care to remove any redundant material or contradictory material,
as we've already seen.</p>

<p>Now there are two other sources according to classical source
theory, and these are D and P. D, which is the Deuteronomic source, is
essentially the book of Deuteronomy. The book of Deuteronomy differs
from the narrative sources. This is a book of speeches. The book
purports to be three speeches delivered by Moses as the Israelites are
poised on the east side of the Jordan River… I'm not good with
directions; I had to stop and think… the east side of the Jordan River,
about to enter the Promised Land. But according to the source theorists
it clearly reflects the interests of settled agrarian life. It doesn't
reflect the interests of people who have been wandering around
nomadically. It has laws that deal with settled agrarian life. The main
characteristic of D, however, which assisted source theorists in fixing
its date, is the following: D is the one source in the Bible that
clearly insists that one central sanctuary only is acceptable to
Yahweh. God cannot be worshiped at makeshift altars. God cannot be
worshipped through sacrifices at some local sanctuary; all sacrifices
must be offered in the one central sanctuary where "he will cause his
name to dwell." It doesn't actually ever say Jerusalem, which is why
Samaritans think that it's at Mount Gerizim and that they have the
correct temple and that they're authorized to offer sacrifices. They
[the Israelites] got it wrong when they thought it was Jerusalem;
Samaritans think that that [Mt. Gerizim] is where God caused his name
to dwell. So Jerusalem is not actually mentioned in Deuteronomy, that's
a later reading, but the place where God will cause his name to dwell,
and only at the temple there, can there be sacrifices. This is a very
different perspective from other biblical books. So you're going to see
in the stories of the patriarchs that they're wandering all around the
land and they're offering sacrifices. There are other books too where
it's clear that there are local shrines, local sanctuaries, local
priests who are offering sacrifices for people throughout the land. But
Deuteronomy insists: one central sanctuary. All of the outlying alters
and sacred places must be destroyed.</p>

<p>Now centralization of the cult was a key part of the religious
reform of a king of Judah in 622. I've marked a couple of dates on the
timeline up here: 722 is the fall of the Northern Kingdom, 622 a reform
by King Josiah in Judah [correction: Professor Hayes meant Judea, not
Judah here]. We read about this in one of the historical narratives
where the temple's being refurbished. A book is found that says one
central sanctuary. King Josiah says: What have we been doing? Get rid
of the outlying altars, everything has to be centralized here. So that
reform, Josiah's reform has caused many scholars to associate
Deuteronomy, the centralizing book or source, with the late-seventh
century, around this time in Judah.</p>

<p>The trouble is D seems to reflect a lot of northern traditions, the
interests of tribes who are in the north. Well the Northern Kingdom was
destroyed in 722; so this is the theory: source critics conclude that D
is an old source that was originally composed in the north in the
eighth century. When the northern kingdom fell, when the Assyrians
conquered and many Israelites would have fled to the southern kingdom,
Deuteronomy or the D source was brought to Jerusalem, stored in the
temple where a hundred years later it was discovered and its
centralization was put into force by King Josiah.</p>

<p>P is the Priestly source, and that is found mostly in the books of
Leviticus and the non-narrative portions of Numbers. Now the major
characteristics of P, the Priestly source, are (1) a great concern with
religious institutions, with the sacrificial system, with the Sabbath,
with holidays, with rituals like circumcision, the Passover, dietary
restrictions (the laws of <i>kashrut</i>) the system of ritual purity
and impurity, and also holiness, ethical holiness and cultic or ritual
holiness. P does have some narrative, and you've read some of it:
Genesis 1, the first creation account, is attributed to P. It's
orderly, it's systematized, the god is extraordinarily abstract.
Because in the P source another characteristic is that; (2) God is
transcendent, and even perhaps remote, much more so than in J, for
example. Generally in the P source, God is concealed and revealed only
in his <i>kavod</i>. This is a word that's often translated as "glory,"
but what it refers to actually is a light-filled cloud. God seems to be
the burning fire inside this light-filled cloud. He travels before the
Israelites in that form, leading them through the wilderness and so on.
That seems to be in the P source. P is also; (3) interested in
covenants, in censuses, in genealogies. All of those sections very
often that link stories, are attributed to the P source. And because P
elements often serve that kind of function as a bridge between stories,
or very often P sources seem to introduce a story or conclude a story,
the source critics felt that priestly writers were probably responsible
for the final editing of the Bible, bringing together J and E and D and
adding their materials and finally editing the work. Now, Wellhausen
dated the priestly source to [or after] the exilic period, the period
after the fall of the Southern Kingdom in 586 when the Babylonians have
taken many of the Judeans into exile in Babylon.</p>

<p>So the narrative parts of P, J and E are continuous parallel
accounts of the history of the world, if you will, from creation until
the death of Moses. Source critics believe that they have a uniform
style, uniform vocabulary, uniform set of themes, and chronological
framework. So according to Wellhausen, and I sort of schematized it
chronologically for you up here [on the board], the priestly school
drew together all of this older material, added some of its own
editorial material--bridges, introductions, conclusions--inserted the
large priestly documents of Leviticus and Numbers, and so the
Torah--and they did this [after] sitting in exile in Babylon--and so
the Torah is really the result of five centuries of religious and
literary activity. And this of course is a very, very different
portrait from traditional claims about the authorship of the Pentateuch
by one man, Moses, in approximately the fourteenth century BCE.</p>

<p>There are different terms that we use to describe the modern,
critical study of the Bible in the late nineteenth century as I've just
described it. One term is literary criticism, because it proceeds by
closely analyzing the literary features of the text: the terminology,
the style, the motifs. But because the goal of this literary critical
school was to identify specific sources, isolate sources, we also refer
to it as source criticism. You'll see those terms used interchangeably
in your literature. Today literary criticism has a slightly different
connotation from what it was in the nineteenth century, so people
prefer the term source criticism. But you should know both are
used.</p>

<p>However, the purpose of identifying and isolating these sources was
not just to say, "Look at that, there are these different sources." The
purpose was to ascertain as far as possible their relative dates to one
another, and to therefore enable the work of historical reconstruction
to proceed: primarily a reconstruction of the history of the religion
of Israel, and the historical situation of the authors of the different
sources. Therefore literary criticism is not only called source
criticism. It's also called historical criticism, because its ultimate
goal and purpose was not just to isolate the sources, but to arrange
them according to relative dates as far as they might be ascertained,
and then to chart changes in Israel's religion.</p>

<p>You have a very readable introduction to some of this in Norman
Habel's little work [<i>Literary Criticism of the Old Testament</i>].
Another excellent work which is not on your syllabus that is also
critical of Wellhausen and some of the biases in his work, is found in
a little work called <i>Who Wrote the Bible</i> by Richard Friedman,
which has a great cover because it says "<i>Who Wrote the Bible?</i>
Richard Friedman," [audience laughter].</p>

<p>So to sum up: the documentary hypothesis is an effort to explain the
contradictions, the doublets, anachronisms and so on in the Bible by
means of hypothetical source documents. So the theory posits
hypothetical sources, traditions and documents to explain the current
shape of the Torah the way we have it, to account for some of these
phenomena that we find. As a next step the sources are assigned
relative dates, not absolute dates, relative dates, and then they're
analyzed to reveal the different stages of Israel's religious history.
And so source criticism is also known as historical criticism because
it's a tool for getting at the history, not just at the text, but
ultimately a history of Israelite religion. That is how it has been
used.</p>

<p>Now Wellhausen's work is subtle and it's quite brilliant, but it
certainly reflects biases of nineteenth- century German scholarship,
which believed strongly in the superiority of Christianity over
Judaism. In his writings Wellhausen has some things to say about
Judaism that are none too flattering. He describes Judaism at the end
of the biblical period as a dead tree, twisted and perverted. He
especially harbored a distaste for things cultic: priests, cult,
ritual, in keeping with what was going on in Germany at the time, and
the Protestant movement and so on. And these sorts of biases are very
apparent in his work, and very apparent in his dating of the sources,
and in his description of the evolutionary stages of Israel's
religion.</p>

<p>So for example, source critics before Wellhausen all thought that P,
the priestly material, was some of the oldest material in the Bible,
that it was an early source. But Wellhausen said no, it must be a late
source, because priestly, cultic, ritual material--that's clearly a
degenerate stage of religion that shows a sort of guilt-ridden
behaviorism. It's not true of spiritual religion, so clearly that's the
latest stage of Israelite religion when it had died and was waiting to
be reborn in new form with the arrival of someone in the first century.
Clearly his dating of P owes a great deal to his biases and religious
ideology. He saw the priestly material as having to come from the
[post]-exilic age, post 586 [or later] [see note 1], and this is one of
Wellhausen's most controversial points that's still hotly debated
today, and we're going to return to this debate when we actually take a
look at Leviticus and Numbers. At that time we'll be able to see what's
at stake in the whole question of the dating of the priestly
material.</p>

<p>The historical critical method, and the documentary hypothesis in
particular, are not inherently biased, I want to make that point very
strongly. They are simply analytical tools: look at the text and its
features and draw some conclusions based on what you're finding. They
are simply analytical tools. They're not inherently biased. They can be
applied fairly to the text, and they're extraordinarily useful. It's
just that some of the earlier practitioners of these methods did have
ideological axes to grind, and we need to be aware of that.</p>

<p>The documentary hypothesis works fairly well when you have parallel
accounts. It works a little bit less well when the accounts are
interwoven because sometimes picking apart the sources can become dry
and mechanical, sometimes to the point of absurdity. Some of the people
who have carried this method to its extreme will go through and almost
word for word--this is J, this is E, the next word is P… it's quite
remarkable how certain they feel that they can break things down almost
on a word-to-word basis as if an editor sat there with scissors and
paste, cutting out word for word, and putting them together. It
sometimes can reach heights of absurdity, and it can really destroy the
power of a magnificent story, sometimes, when you carve it up into
pieces that on their own don't really make all that much sense.</p>

<p>It needs to be remembered that the documentary hypothesis is only a
hypothesis. An important and a useful one, and I certainly have used it
myself. But none of the sources posited by critical scholars has been
found independently: we have no copy of J, we have no copy of E, we
have no copy of P by itself or D by itself. So these reconstructions
are based on guesses. Some of them are excellent, excellent guesses,
very well supported by evidence, but some of them are not. Some of the
criteria invoked for separating the sources are truly arbitrary, and
extraordinarily subjective. They are sometimes based on all sorts of
unfounded assumption about the way texts were composed in antiquity,
and the more that we learn about how texts in antiquity were composed,
we realize [for example] that it's perhaps not unusual for a text to
use two different terms for the same thing within one story, since we
find texts in the sixteenth, seventeenth century BCE on one tablet
using two different terms to connote the same thing.</p>

<p>So the criteria that are invoked for separating sources often ignore
the literary conventions of antiquity, and the more that we learn about
that the better able we are to understand the way the biblical text was
composed. Repetition isn't always a sign of dual sources; it often
servers a rhetorical function. Variant terms aren't always a sign of
dual sources; they may have a literary or aesthetic function.</p>

<p>So most biblical scholars today do accept some version of
Wellhausen's theory--yes, we feel the Bible is composed of different
sources. We don't always have tremendous confidence, though, in some of
the finer details and conclusions of his work and the work of other
scholars who followed after him. Some doubt the existence of E
altogether--it is so fragmentary and so isolated. Others defend the
antiquity of P --we'll be coming back to that. Others argue that
everything is post-exilic, everything's after the fifth century. It was
written in the fourth, third century in the Persian period. None of it
comes from an older period. Scandinavian scholars, they're not
enthusiastic about source criticism at all. The whole Copenhagen School
of Bible scholarship prefers--many of them prefer--to see the Bible as
basically an oral narrative that just grew through accretion over time.
So I did assign readings in the documentary hypothesis--it's
extraordinarily important--but you do need to understand that it is one
hypothesis, a major and controlling hypothesis out there, but it's not
without criticism.</p>

<p>Moreover, while it's a very important and worthwhile project to
analyze the component sources and examine their specific concerns and
contribution, and you'll see that I'm a very great fan of P, we must
remember that whatever sources were woven together, they were woven
together with great skill and care by a final redactor, or redactors,
who wanted them to be read as a unity, and surely that must mean
something. It must mean they <i>can</i> be read as a unity and that
that's a challenge that's been issued to us. So the Bible can be read
both analytically and synthetically. We need to combine an awareness of
origins, not gloss over the problems and the contradictions and say,
"Well, we can resolve it by coming up with some strange scenario that
makes both things work." Be aware that there are problems,
contradictions, these derive from different sources, but also be
sensitive to the artistry of the final composition. What does it mean
that both of these elements have been retained here side by side? What
is the phrase? The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. So keep
that awareness.</p>

<p>And in the last 20 years or so, source criticism--actually 30 years
or so--source criticism in the conventional sense of the analysis of
documentary sources has been supplemented by other new and exciting
methodologies in the study of the Bible, and we'll see some of
those.</p>

<p>I've also included as optional reading for you sometimes, a couple
of articles that analyze biblical stories. They are written by someone
who thinks that documentary hypothesis just doesn't really help us out
much at all, and she gives some wonderful, coherent readings of stories
that argue this scene here or this contradiction here isn't a sign of a
different source; it serves this literary purpose, that literary
purpose. And I put those in subversively for you to have a look at in
your own time. They're brilliantly written and they give you insight
into the various ways in which we can read the text [see note 2].</p>

<p>But many of the alternative methodologies for studying the text do
assume sources, in some broad sense even if not all the details of
Wellhausen's theory, so it's clear that a great deal of biblical
scholarship owes its accomplishments and its theories to the work that
was done by the source critics of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>I want to flip back to text for a moment before I return to talk
about a whole contradictory set of methodologies, or methodologies that
pull in another direction. But first I want to get us up to the
patriarchs and matriarchs where we're going to be starting off on
Monday.</p>

<p>We have just had a flood, and then we move into Genesis 10; and
Genesis 10 contains a genealogical table of nations. In this table,
peoples of various lands are portrayed as having descended from a
common source, a common ancestor, Noah, through his three sons,
Japheth, Ham and Shem. Shem: Shemites, Semites. Shemites are said to
descend from Noah's son, Shem. The biblical text at this point is
understanding humanity as basically sharing a common root united by a
common language. The story that follows in Genesis 11 can be understood
then as an etiological tale, a tale that comes to explain something,
and this tale is coming to explain the diversification of language:
when we look around we see that in fact people don't seem to be that
united and are in fact divided by their languages and so on. So how are
we to account for the diversification of languages, the spread of
different ethnic linguistic groups throughout the lands of the earth if
we all come from one common creative moment, one common ancestor?</p>

<p>Genesis 11 explains that. The story is therefore going to act as a
bridge between the first section of Genesis which has a universal
scale, a universal scope, and what happens in Genesis beginning in
Chapter 12, where we're going to focus in on one ethnic, linguistic
group and one land. This story serves as the bridge, first of all
explaining how it is that a united humanity speaking a common language
even becomes diversified linguistically and ethnically, to then focus
in on one group and one land.</p>

<p>Babel, pronounced "<i>bavel</i>" in Hebrew, is Babylon. The tower in
the story of the Tower of Babel is identified by scholars as a very
famous tower, a ziggurat, a ziggurat to Marduk in Babylon. The Bible's
hostility to Babylon--after all it's going to be the Babylonians who
are going to destroy them in 586--but the Bible's hostility to Babylon
and its imperialism is clear. This story has a satirical tone. The word
Babel, <i>Bavel</i>, means Gate of the God, but it's the basis for a
wonderful pun in Hebrew, which also actually happens to work in
English. Babble [is] nonsensical speaking, confusion of language. And I
think there's obviously some onomatopoeic quality to "Babel" that makes
it have that kind of a meaning both in English and a similar word in
Hebrew [<i>balbel</i>]. So this word can also with a little bit of
punning mean confusion, or confused language. So this mighty tower that
was obviously the pride of Babylon in the ancient world is represented
by the biblical storywriter as the occasion for the confusion of human
language.</p>

<p>The construction of Marduk's ziggurat is represented as displeasing
to God. Why? There are very many possible interpretations and our
commentaries are full of them. Some interpreters view the tower
builders as seeking to elevate themselves to storm heaven by building a
tower with its top in the sky. Others see the builders as defying God's
direct order. Remember, God said, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill
the earth," spread out and fill the earth. But these people are said to
come together, they congregate in one place, and instead of spreading
out they're trying to rise high. There seems to be a real defiance of
God's design for humanity, and so God frustrates their plan for
self-monumentalizing, and he scatters them over the face of the earth.
He makes it more difficult for them to do this again by confusing their
tongues. Once again there's a very steep learning curve for this God.
He has to keep adjusting things depending on what it is that humans are
doing. So now he's got to confuse their languages.</p>

<p>Some interpreters see this story as representing a rejection of
civilization or certain aspects of civilization. Monumental
architecture, empire building, these are always things that are looked
upon with suspicion for most of the biblical sources and biblical
writers. Those sorts of ambitions are viewed negatively. They lead to
human self-aggrandizement. They are indicative of an arrogant sort of
self-reliance--that the prophets will certainly rail against--and in
some sense a forgetting of God. So this is a time in which humans
spread out, lose their unity, and this is also a time really when they
turn to the worship of other gods.</p>

<p>The first 11 chapters of Genesis then have given us a cosmic,
universal setting for the history of Israel. Those first chapters cover
2500 years if you go through and add up the chronologies. The rest of
Genesis, Genesis 12 through 50, will cover just four generations: the
generations of the patriarchs and the matriarchs. They will be Abraham
and Sarah; their son Isaac, his wife Rebekah; their son Jacob, his two
wives Rachel and Leah, I am leaving out other wives; but finally their
children, 12 sons and one daughter.</p>

<p>So God's focus has shifted dramatically, the text's focus has
shifted dramatically. Why? When you get to the end of Genesis 11 you
feel that God has been rather shut out. Things aren't going well.
Although God created the earth as an intrinsically good paradise, he
created humans in his image, he provided for them, humans to this point
have put their moral freedom pretty much to poor use.</p>

<p>Many scholars, Kaufman, Sarna and others, say that one of the
differences then between these myths of Israel and the mythologies of
their neighbors is that in Ancient Near Eastern mythologies you have
the struggle of good and evil cosmic powers. In the myths of the Bible
this is replaced by a struggle between the will of God and rebellious
humans. So these myths are telling also of a struggle, but it's on a
different plane. Adam and Eve, Cain, the generation of the flood, the
builders of the tower of Babel--God has been continually spurned or
thwarted by these characters. So he's withdrawing his focus, and is
going to choose to reveal himself to one small group, as if to say,
"Okay, I can't reach everybody, let me see if I can just find one
person, one party, and start from there and build out."</p>

<p>And so in Genesis 12 which begins the second stage of the Bible's
historical narrative, we read that God calls to Abram to leave the land
of his fathers and travel to a land which God will show him, beginning
a whole new stage of the biblical narrative, and we'll sense that
there's a very different feeling when you get to Genesis 12. When you
read that material, it will feel different to you. And because of that
we need to talk a little bit more about ways to read the biblical text,
methods of criticism and so on.</p>

<p>In preparation for looking at the biblical narrative material that
deals specifically with the Israelites, we need to think of some, or
learn about some, of the other critical methodologies that are used in
biblical scholarship, and for a moment we're going to the adopt the
role of historian. I'm going to ask you to think like
historians--whatever that might mean--now and as we move into next week
and look at Genesis 12 through 50.</p>

<p>The source critical method that we talked about today focuses on the
hypothetical period of the compilation of the text, the compilation of
the four sources into the Torah. But later scholars began to ask,
"Well, what about the pre-history of those sources? What were the
sources' sources?" Why should that be important? Remember that the
source critics claimed and concluded that J, E, P and D were written
from the tenth to the sixth centuries, and the implication, well
actually not just the implication, the strong assertion of many of them
was that despite the fact that they purport to tell of events prior to
1000, in fact they're just not at all reliable for those periods. They
were written centuries after the fact, we really can't know anything
about Israel, Israel's religion, Israel's history, religious history
before the tenth century.</p>

<p>That was a very dissatisfying conclusion to many people, because the
writers of J, E, P and D probably didn't sit down at typewriters and
just invent their documents out of whole cloth. It doesn't seem that
that's the way these materials would have been composed. They didn't
invent, probably, all of these cultic rules and ritual practices all of
a sudden. It seems likely that they were drawing on older traditions
themselves: older stories, older customs, older laws, ritual practices.
Scholars in the next wave of biblical scholarship began to ask a
different set of questions; they became interested in asking: what
materials did the compiler or the compilers of J or E or P draw on in
the composition of those sources? Did they use more ancient materials,
and if so can we figure out what they were? Do they contain reliable
traditions for an earlier stage? And if so, then maybe we do have
access after all to information regarding Israelite history prior to
the year 1000. Suddenly you see an analytical approach to the Bible
that's going to pull in the exact opposite direction from the classical
source theory.</p>

<p>One of the leading scholars to take up this question was Hermann
Gunkel, whose name is at the top over there [on the board]. Gunkel had
a great knowledge of the oral literature of other cultures, other
nations, and that led him to ask: Can we perhaps analyze these four
literary source documents and figure out the pre-literary stages of
their development? What went into their compilation and composition? He
found support for this idea within the Bible itself because at times
the Bible seems to name earlier sources quite explicitly. We don't have
records of those sources anymore, but they seem to be named in the
Bible. In Numbers 21:14 there's a little poetic excerpt that gives the
boundaries between Moab and the Amorites, and it's quoted and it says
it's from the Book of the Wars of the Lord. It's quoted as if this is a
source that the person is drawing on and using in the composition of
his text, and it's quoted in a way that makes it sound as if the source
should be familiar to the reader.</p>

<p>We also have mention of something called the Book of Yashar in
Joshua, that's also quoted, in Joshua 10:13. Or in 2 Samuel 1:18, we
have David lamenting, a very beautiful lament over the death of Saul
and his beloved Jonathan. It seems to actually be an epic song that
recounts acts of Israel's heroes. He's reciting that now as he laments
over the death of these two, and so it seems to be an earlier source
that's been put into the story of David and his lament.</p>

<p>So it seems reasonable in light of the practices of other people,
other ancient cultures and literatures as well as some contemporary
literatures, and it seems reasonable in light of the explicit citation
of sources in the biblical text to suppose that in fact the four
primary documents are themselves compilations from other source
materials, or drawing on written or oral materials from an even earlier
period.</p>

<p>Gunkel began to focus on small little units. He was interested in
small units within the four primary documents, and he identified genres
or forms, what he called forms. The German word is a <i>Gattung</i>,
<i>Gattungen</i>, forms. He would identify these small units, and that
gave rise to the name of this approach, which is form criticism. He
believed that what he was doing was identifying older, pre-literary
forms that had been taken up and incorporated by the literary sources,
by J, E, P and D.</p>

<p>Examples of the kind of form, or <i>Gattung</i>, that he would
identify are things like a hymn, a proverb--we often have biblical
texts quoting proverbs that seem to be folk sayings--laws, rituals,
folk stories of a particular type, poems, legends, songs, fragments of
mythology. So for example he says of Genesis 6:1-4, a passage that
you've read:</p>

<blockquote>When men began to increase on earth and daughters were born
to them, the divine beings saw how beautiful the daughters of men were
and took wives from among those that pleased them. The Lord said, "My
breath shall not abide in man forever, since he too is flesh; let the
days allowed him be one hundred and twenty years." It was then, and
later too, that the Nephilim [these giants of some kind] appeared on
earth--when the divine beings cohabited with the daughters of men, who
bore them offspring [these giants, these Nephilim]. They were the
heroes of old, the men of renown.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>That's just stuck in there, in Genesis 6:1-4. This is an older
fragment of a mythology or a legend which is put into place here. It's
explaining the origin of heroes and great men of renown in the old
days.</p>

<p>He also says that there are etiological stories. We've talked about
those--legends that give the origin of a name, or a ritual, or an
institution. There are different types of etiological stories. He says
there are ethnological legends that will give you the story accounting
for the origin of a particular people: so the Moabites for example, and
the Ammonites--not a flattering story at all following the destruction
of Sodom and Gomorrah. Obviously the Israelites didn't care for those
people very much and gave them a pretty nasty origin.</p>

<p>We also have etymological legends, because they're explaining the
name of something. It's given this particular name because of an
etymomological connection with some event earlier.</p>

<p>So all of these things, he argues, are probably older existing
traditions that have been taken up and adapted by the biblical writer,
and they may preserve some historical reminiscence. More importantly,
more important then the actual events that they might be reporting, is
the fact that behind each of these is some sort of function. Each one
of these did some sort of cultural work, it had some function or
setting in life. That's what we can discover when we isolate these
forms: this setting in life. That helps us learn something about
ancient Israelite society or culture way before the tenth century.
That's Gunkel's claim.</p>

<p>So form criticism wasn't content with just identifying these various
types of material, these various genres; it asked what was their
function? What was their <i>Sitz im Leben</i>? What was their situation
in life, their cultural context? What does it tell us that we have a
large number of liturgical texts? What does it tell us that we have a
large number of texts that seem to point to some sort of judicial
context? What does it tell us that we have a great deal of proverbs, or
wisdom material in certain parts of the Bible that we might date to a
certain time? What does this tell us about society and what people were
doing?</p>

<p>Growing out of form criticism is tradition criticism. This is a type
of criticism that focuses on the transmission of traditional material
through various stages, oral stages and literary stages, until it
reaches its present form in the text. Now you can imagine as a story is
told and then it's retold, it is obviously changed and adapted.
Tradition criticism looks at that. Looking at Ancient Near Eastern
parallels is very helpful. You can see how some of those motifs and
themes were changed in the process of being transmitted within
Israelite culture and society, and again, to serve some sort of
cultural function, or purpose. So the present text of the Pentateuch
obviously rests on a very, very long period of transmission, both oral
recitation and transmission, very much like the Greek classics, Homer's
classics, the <i>Odyssey</i>, the <i>Iliad</i>: they also had a long
history of oral recitation and transmission, and were transformed along
the way. Tradition criticism likes to look at the way people receive
traditional material, rework it in creative ways and then adapt it to
their own purposes and contexts and transmit it.</p>

<p>Sometimes that process is reflected in the Bible itself. Traditions
in one part of the Bible will be picked up in a later part of the
Bible, and written rather differently with a different point of view.
So Deuteronomy, for example, recounts events that we've also read about
in Exodus, and sometimes the differences are startling. Sometimes there
are completely new emphases and the story can come out to be a very,
very different story. 1 and 2 Chronicles are a retelling and a
reworking of much of the material from Genesis through 2 Kings, and it
cleans up a lot of the embarrassing moments. It presses its own themes
in retelling those stories. Early laws are subject to reinterpretation.
Ezekiel comes along and does some interesting things with some of the
legal material that we find in Leviticus. This is all the kind of thing
that tradition criticism looks at. Tradition criticism wants to uncover
the changes that occur in the transmission of traditional material.
It's already happening--we can see it--within the Bible, and the
assumption therefore is that it happens before the material even gets
into the Bible. Perhaps we can figure some of that out, and it's a
process that also aids in historical reconstruction.</p>

<p>So you can see after classic source criticism, which came along and
leveled people's interest in anything before the tenth century, and
said: all we have are these written accounts that reflect the biases of
the people at the time who wrote them, you then have the rise of types
of scholarship that say: we're not satisfied with that. That's not
really how literature works. People don't sit down and invent things
out of whole cloth, particularly material of this type. It clearly has
a history, they're clearly drawing on sources and maybe we can use
analytical tools to figure out something about the period that you
might think would be lost to history. So these types of criticism are
emphasizing the real life historical setting of the materials that are
in the biblical sources, their relationship to the wider culture, and
that's something that earlier source criticism didn't care too much
about.</p>

<p>All of these analytical modes of studying the Bible--by analytical I
mean sitting down and analyzing the features, the literary features of
the text, and drawing conclusions from them--all of these modes of
examining the Bible--most of them developed by German scholars--can be
contrasted with the North American tradition of scholarship which
emphasized the correlation of biblical and archaeological data. I've
written the name Albright; William F. Albright, was a leading scholar
at the American school of biblical studies, and he was an expert in the
fields of Palestinian archaeology and Assyriology. He focused on
illustrating the Bible with the Ancient Near Eastern sources that at
that time were newly coming to light-- archaeological findings; and his
argument was--and it's an argument that's to a large degree not
accepted anymore but--his argument at the time was that archaeology
supported the basic historicity of biblical tradition.</p>

<p>There are some definite problems, however, with viewing the Bible as
history. There are certainly problems with chronology: it's hard to pin
down dates for a lot of things. Many of the events are given more then
one date. A lot of the numbers...the Bible tends to use ideal numbers;
it tends to use fives and multiples of five, or multiples of five plus
seven. You have ten generations from Adam to Noah. You have ten
generations from Noah to Abram. These things begin to raise suspicions.
We have suspicious repetitions of events, things that happened to two
or more of the patriarchs: twice Abraham goes into foreign territory
and tries to pass his wife off as his sister. Isaac does the same
thing. Are these three versions of one basic tradition that got
assigned to different patriarchs? Are we supposed to think of these as
representing three separate historical incidents? What's the likelihood
of these things happening? Is that historically reasonable? So there
are lots of reasons to feel that biblical chronologies of the
patriarchal period are not accurate historical records: I use that
phrase [accurate historical record] with some timidity. But in the
twentieth century scholars of Albright's school argued that many of the
traditions in the book of Genesis contained authentic reflections of
the historical period they claimed to deal with. And they cited a
number of considerations.</p>

<p>We'll take those up on Monday, but I would like you--as you read
Genesis 12 and forward and think about that material--I'd like you to
ask yourself: Is this historical writing? By what criteria do I judge
historical writing? What do I think historical writing is? What makes
some writing historical? What makes other writing fictional? Where do
we get these genres from? Why is so important to us to figure out what
this is? Think about some of those issues, and we'll talk a little bit
more about that as we turn to the texts in Genesis 12.</p>

<p><b>Notes<br />
<br />
</b>1. In general the terms exilic and post-exilic are not used with
great precision in these lectures. Technically speaking the term exilic
is used to refer to the period between the destruction (586 BCE) and
the Restoration in the 530s BCE, while post-exilic refers to the period
initiated by the restoration. However, in these lectures the term
exilic is occasionally used to refer to any time from the exile on.
Strictly speaking, Wellhausen placed the P source in the post-exilic
period.</p>
