            <h3>About the Course</h3>
            <p>The course covers basic concepts of biomedical engineering and their connection with the spectrum of human activity. It serves as an introduction to the fundamental science and engineering on which biomedical engineering is based. Case studies of drugs and medical products illustrate the product development-product testing cycle, patent protection, and FDA approval. It is designed for science and non-science majors. <a href="/yale/biomedical-engineering/frontiers-in-biomedical-engineering/content/sessions.html"> view class sessions &gt;&gt;</a></p>
