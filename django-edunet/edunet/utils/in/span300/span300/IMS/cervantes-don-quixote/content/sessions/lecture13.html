<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>The modern novel that develops from the <em>Quixote</em> is essentially a political novel and an urban genre dealing with cities. In Part II there is a sense of the text being written and performed in the present because it incorporates current events, such as the expulsion of the <em>moriscos</em>, a critic of the <em>arbitristas</em> and a satire of the aristocracy. In part two of the <em>Quixote</em> Part I plays the role that the romances of chivalry played in Part I: the characters have read the first part and so a new larger mirror has been added to the play of mirrors that was already present. Characters evolve within a social context, which is consonant with the political character of the novel and has much to do with the development and evolution of realism in literature in the representation of everyday life and of common people. An explanation of the Baroque aspects that appear in the second part of the novel helps to understand the <em>Quixote</em> as a whole and its relation with the first part.</p>
