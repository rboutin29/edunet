<h3>About the Course</h3>
<p>Can law change human behavior to be less environmentally damaging?  Law will be examined through case histories including:  environmental effects of national security, pesticides, air pollution, consumer products, plastics, parks and protected area management, land use, urban growth and sprawl, public/private transit, drinking water standards, food safety, and hazardous site restoration.  In each case we will review the structure of law and evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. <a href="/environmental-studies/environmental-politics-and-law/content/class-sessions"> view&nbsp;class&nbsp;sessions&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</a></p>
