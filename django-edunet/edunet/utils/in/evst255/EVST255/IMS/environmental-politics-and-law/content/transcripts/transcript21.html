<p><b>Professor John Wargo:
</b>Okay
everybody, let's start in. Today I want to talk about green building and the
opportunity to also think about the laws that surround green building, and also
the energy implications of green building standards. And I'd like to also
address the history by having you think about the way that these standards have
evolved over time, particularly the evolution of certification programs. </p>
<p>So the idea of
certification, I want you to think about it quite broadly at the outset.
Because it basically implies that certain standards are being applied to
something. It might be a product, it could be a service. It could be a
neighborhood, a city. So that the idea that there is an expert group that would
review something, whether or not it's your academic preparation and
performance, or whether or not it's a building's performance, and then certify
it, give it a symbol. It would rank it relative to others. One obvious example
would be looking at a GPA on a transcript. Well, what we'll see after today's
lecture is that the green building programs that have evolved in Europe, in the
United States, and Australia, they really are based on that same kind of
concept. So how would you rate the environmental and health responsibility and
energy efficiency of new building standards? How would they apply or how might
they apply to renovation projects? So I'm basically going to use the lecture
today to share with you an overview of a paper that will be published in about
two weeks that is a critique of the U.S. Green Building Council's program known
as LEED. </p>
<p>So I'd like you also
think about the importance of the building sector in its demand for energy in
the United States. Buildings consume seventy-six percent of the U.S.
electricity and emit almost half of the nation's greenhouse gases. So that how
we manage the future of building and development will very much influence the
intensity of energy demand. Keep in mind also that the U.S. consumes more
energy than any other country in the world, and U.S. consumers consume nearly
twenty-five percent of the world's energy and only accounts for five percent of
the world's population. So that our energy demand is increasing at about two
percent per year. </p>
<p>So why might that be?
I mean, obviously, we're changing our behavior. We're changing our technology
and our dependence on technology. And also the environments that we shape
around us have enormous implications for energy that often are not well understood,
for a variety of reasons. You, for example, probably have no understanding of
how your daily behavior and variability in your behavior might influence your
daily energy demand. The way that you manage your computers, the way that you
manage your windows, your air exchange between indoor and outdoor environments,
the way you manage lights, whether or not you have a car on campus. If you do,
how often do you use it? Where do you park it? What's its fuel efficiency? So
thinking about how to keep track of an individual's energy demand is really not
in most people's minds clearly defined. </p>
<p>So as I just said,
the contribution to the climate change problem and our dependence on foreign
oil is really very much dependent upon the way that we build and the way that
we set up standards to encourage energy efficiency. So thirty-nine percent of CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions come from the building sector, forty percent of total energy
consumption, thirteen percent of water consumption, and about fifteen percent
of gross domestic product per year is associated with the building sector. </p>
<p>Think about the
different patterns of growth and how the different patterns of growth and
neighborhood development influence the way that we use energy. These houses are
not connected, so they can't gain any benefit for heat conservation by having
adjoining walls. They all had their own yards. And in fact, if you think about
how people move around in these kinds of neighborhoods, you'd realize that
because of the fencing in the back yard and without gates that go between all
the different lots it would be quite normal for somebody to get in a car and
then drive all the way around the block to take their kids to somebody else's
house that might be less than a baseball throw away. So that patterns of development
encourage patterns of transit that have just an enormous influence on the way
that we consume electricity, but also petroleum products. </p>
<p>So think also about
the cities in the nation that during the 1990s and over the past decade have
experienced some of the most rapid rates of growth. Well, these include Las
Vegas. And Las Vegas is expanding into the desert in a manner and at a density
that is suburban, it's sprawling. But it's unusual in Las Vegas because of the
arid environment. So that the every house would likely have a lawn, the lawn
would require sprinkling. Many of these houses also, once they're built out,
would have swimming pools. So that think about the way that the use of water
demands energy to not just move it around, not just the distribution, but also
filtration and also the energy that goes into putting in the infrastructure to
move it around. </p>
<p>Now, on Thursday, I'm
going to come back and talk more about the new town movement in the United
States and this problem of managing growth at a larger scale than today's
lecture, which is really focused on the individual buildings. But it is
interesting that a movement evolved in the 1960s and 1970s in the United States
to design neighborhoods, to design whole new communities in a way that would
take into account some of these problems. Irvine, California is the example in
this slide. And you can see the center of the campus, but you can also see the
large academic buildings surrounding a green in the center, and then in the
adjacent areas, you have recreational facilities, but also higher density
housing nearby. So a very walkable community, one that is not based on the idea
of segregating land uses, commercial versus residential versus industrial
versus recreational. So that in suburban Connecticut, you put your kids in a
car and you drive from the area where you live to where you work to the
recreational area to dance lessons, whatever it is. So that this community was
intentionally designed back in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s in a way that would provide for
mixed land uses and offer opportunities for much increased pedestrian traffic. </p>
<p>As opposed to
suburban areas around New Haven, here's an example of a community about twenty
miles away that many of my colleagues live in. And this is zoning at a scale of
about one unit per four to five acres. So each of these houses has a strip of
land that reaches back from it into an area that might otherwise be common open
space. So that this low-density development demands even more time spent in
cars and more fuel. A good example of a house in a more rural part of
Connecticut. So keep these things in mind as you're thinking about your own
behavior, the way you grew up, and you try to consider how your lifestyle
choices influenced your family's consumption level. </p>
<p>Also, I want you to
think about the idea of size, and how we are increasingly dependent upon many
consumer products in our lives that are larger than they used to be. And
housing is no exception. So that the average house size in 2009 is grown to
about 2,500 square feet, with about two point three on average people per
house. That's really pretty remarkable. So you know, roughly 1,000 square feet
per person. Whereas back in 1950, the average number of people in a house was
much closer to three, a little bit over three with the post-World War II baby
boom, with a total size of 800 square feet. So the house size has grown by
three fold. In 1970, it grew to 1,500 feet. So the energy demands of a larger
house like that are actually quite difficult to predict if you try to take into
account the diversity of building materials. </p>
<p>Boy, I apologize for
this. And, you know, one of you might go outside and let them know that there's
a lecture going on in here. That would be really nice. The construction is
creating also diesel fumes inside the building. </p>
<p>Many of the garages
that you find in suburban areas also have grown in size. So here's an example
of a garage that is actually larger than the average house size was back in
1950. This is probably about a twenty-two, twenty-three by thirty foot house.
So that's roughly 1,200 square feet, pretty interesting. Now think about the
way that space is laid out. So here's a studio apartment on the right hand
side. And you see a dining table, a kitchenette, walk-in closet and a bath on
the upper level. Whereas the base level is dominated by a garage. So that we're
allocating less space indoors to our bedrooms than we are to our auto storage
areas. </p>
<p>Also, many buildings
are now constructed with much more glass in them than previously. And the newer
high-end buildings are using special glass that is designed to reflect
radiation so that it's not absorbed. But different glasses are really designed
for different climatic regions so that some are more efficient at reflecting
radiation that are used in southern climates that are warmer. And others are
more efficient at providing insulation, so they've got a barrier in the
interior that basically protects against heat loss. So that overall though,
buildings' increased use of windows has created increased energy demands. Also
lighting. And also the way that we have increasingly designed bathrooms to have
more than one fixture. So here's an example of a shower stall that has multiple
showerheads in it, multiple faucets. So that water demand is often increased in
bathrooms designed like this. </p>
<p>Most green building
programs also attempt to regulate the building materials that are used in
furnishings. So here's an example of a bookcase and set of drawers that
seemingly are made out of oak. But this is actually an oak veneer. And if you
have been up in Kroon Hall where the Forestry and Environmental Studies School
is, you may know that about seventy percent of the wood that's on the interior
of this was grown on Yale property, on Yale forests. It also is red oak, but
it's solid red oak. It's not a veneer. </p>
<p>So what's beneath the
veneer? Here you can see a strip of pressboard that is faced with a white oak
surface. But the interior is basically low-grade wood chips of a variety of
different species that are compressed together and they are mixed up in liquid
form with adhesives and then they are rolled out in a strip and then cut into a
variety of different sizes. The adhesives have compounds that are often
proprietary and even unknown to most who purchase them or sell them at building
supply houses. They commonly contain adhesives that are epoxy resins, some of
which contain bisphenol-A that we talked about earlier in the course. But also
formaldehyde is a component that is commonly used that is an allergen and it's
a suspected carcinogen. </p>
<p>I'd like you to think
too about the problem of your understanding. How could you increase your
understanding of the energy intensity of your own lifestyle? Well, here's a
pretty good example of the way that houses that were built in the 1990s and
previously are metered. So that this is at your utility junction box, where the
line comes in from the road. This is my meter. I have the same brand. And it's
got five dials on it. And you might think, well that's not that tough to figure
out. But if you walk up to it, you'll see that the dials actually have the
numbers that on the first dial on the left, it goes from lowest to highest in a
clockwise motion. But in the second it goes from lowest to highest in a
counterclockwise motion. So they switch on as you move across the screen. So
this is actually a very difficult thing to keep track of. Now also, you might
wonder well, how would I find out how my variance in behavior, how I manage my
computers or my lights or my water consumption, or how big a refrigerator I
have, how is that going to affect my electric bill? It's really hard to figure
it out given this kind of a metering system. Because if you can decipher what
the meter says, you'll only get a total figure for your consumption. Now, this
has created an opportunity for people to design a variety of smart meters that
keep track of energy intake and use and how it's distributed in a house for
different purposes. </p>
<p>So that I tried to
figure this out given my dial meter at my home and ended up turning off
absolutely everything in the house and then starting up appliances one by one.
So I'd start the refrigerator and I'd turn the refrigerator off. I'd start a
dryer, start a dishwasher, but that would be the only appliance that I would
have running. But you can imagine, every time you plug in one and then go out
to the meter and take a reading, come back in, unplug it and plug in something
else, it's going to take you a very long time to figure out where you're
spending your money. By doing that over a period of about eight hours, I was
able to save about twenty-five percent of my average monthly energy bill by
figuring out how to restrict access or fully turn off different appliances in
the house. </p>
<p>Building products and
building construction is normally regulated by a variety of building codes,
many of which have been adopted internationally. So that these codes apply to
materials, they apply to electrical systems, they apply to energy sources, fire
prevention, mechanical, heating and ventilation and air condition systems,
plumbing. They even apply to historical sites and in earthquake-prone parts of
the country, they have a code that is distinctive in California for earthquake
stability. So that these codes evolved originally as being voluntary, so that
they were not formally adopted by state or local governments. But now you'll
find most states do have similar kinds of building codes. And they were
originally designed to promote understanding of the functionality and the
safety and the durability of different kinds of products, also to promote truth
in labeling. But they never really were designed to promote environmental
responsibility, health protection or energy efficiency. So that the green
building movement was really ripe for a brand new certification system that
would apply a variety of different kinds of standards. </p>
<p>And the three
programs that I'll mention today include the LEED program by the U.S. Green
Building Council, the BREEAM program in the United Kingdom, and the Green Star
program in Australia. And the BRE Environmental Assessment Method is perhaps
the best known in the world right now, and it's the most widely adopted
throughout Europe. And it set standards for best practices in sustainable
design and has become really a de facto measure used to describe a building's
environmental performance within the European Union. Australia has the Green
Star program, which is national, it's also voluntary, that evaluates
construction, environmental design, and has been particularly well developed
for commercial structures, especially office buildings in downtown districts,
where about eleven percent of the buildings have been constructed and certified
under the program. </p>
<p>So its purposes are
to first of all, try to figure out a common language and common definition for
what &quot;green&quot; is. So that before the National Organic Food Standard was adopted,
there was no national consistency in the definition of what organic food was,
so it varied by certification scheme. The Green Star program also sets
measurement standards. So that there is a common approach to measuring say
energy consumption or the capacity of different building materials, such as
electrical conduit. And they also promoted a whole building design, so that one
would think about not just the individual components, the individual building
materials or the different systems, and by systems, I mean like water supply,
electrical supply, perhaps the heating and ventilation system, plumbing. But to
figure out how to put all of these components together in a way that would
minimize the long-term adverse affect on environmental quality or human health
or energy loss. </p>
<p>So this idea that one
would think about building materials and the style of design in a way that
would consider the ultimate product lifecycle, this is really a pretty new idea
in the building industry. So that, you know, what's going to happen to that PVC
pipe that exists in your house when your building gets torn down? What's going
to happen to the copper piping that delivers the water? Well, the PVC pipe, you
can almost be assured is going to be either burned or it's going to be
discarded in a landfill. But the copper piping is highly likely to be recycled
because of its market value. So differences in these programs are normally
associated with the way that they allocate credits or points to buildings for
different purposes. But they really are quite similar in their attempt to
promote energy conservation, concern for chemical life cycles, as well as human
health. </p>
<p>So the Green Building
Council evolved, beginning in 1993. And this is what I want to focus on now for
the remainder of the session. And it is a voluntary nonprofit organization that
has no government affiliation, although it was started by a grant from the U.S.
Energy Department. So this is created with a board of directors that include
people that have expertise in architecture and engineering as well as some of
the largest development firms, construction firms, in the nation. There are
really not a number of people on this board or on the staff that have deep
environmental or health expertise. And its orientation has predominantly been
to promote energy efficiency. They claim that the benefits of this leadership
in energy and environmental design, which is what the LEED acronym stands for,
that it has three predominant purposes. One is to promote environmental
quality. The second is economic development to basically stimulate a new type
of building and new building materials that are more environmentally
responsible. Sorry about the noise. And also to promote healthy lifestyles
within buildings and communities. </p>
<p>And by healthy
lifestyles within a building, I'll give you one example. A colleague of mine
works at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, and they have a relatively
new building. And just as a healthy lifestyle attribute, they decided that
instead of putting a staircase in the back of the building and the elevator
right near the front door when people walked in, that they would reverse that.
So the elevator was put in the back and the staircase was surrounded by glass
panels that made it really light, sunlight steams through and attractive. So
that people, when they go into the building, normally walk up the stairs, a
seven- or eight- story building. So that this individual who directed the
National Center for Environmental Health told me that he and his staff, that
nobody uses the elevator, everybody goes up and down the stairs. So it saves
energy, the elevator is not used much. And it also is healthy, it's burning up
calories. </p>
<p>So that the purpose
of LEED falls into a variety of categories. One is sustainable sites, another
is water efficiency, another is energy and atmosphere, another is materials and
resources. The fifth is indoor environmental quality, and the fourth is really
creativity and innovation in design. So I mean, you might image different
categories might be a part of a system such as this. But there are interesting
questions about the relative importance that these categories should be assigned.
Should you be assigned as much about the nature of the site that's chosen for
building? Whether or not it's remote and is going to be in a green field area
as opposed to the site that might be hazardous and contaminated? So that the
Kroon Hall up on Prospect Street across from the Whale, Kroon Hall was built on
a highly contaminated site. So that a former power plant was there, and a lot
of work had to be done to clean that site up to remove contaminated debris as
well as other infrastructure, the heating and electrical and hot air conduits
that go from the power plant up to Science Hill, particularly Kline Science
Tower. So that the idea that you would give more credits to a building program
that would not chew up undisturbed areas that are in say the suburbs, you'd
give more credit to those that were actively going to restore sites, is an
interesting concept.</p>
<p>The certification
program that I'm going to talk about today has to do with new construction and
renovation. Although there are other programs that LEED has, for example a
program for schools, a program for homes. So that in this program, there are a
hundred base points plus ten possible bonus points. And there are different
levels of certification that can be achieved. So if you achieve forty to forty-nine
points, you are certified. Up to fifty to fifty-nine points, you're given a
silver certification, a gold is sixty to seventy-nine, and then platinum is
eighty to a hundred and ten points. You could imagine a variety of different
strategies here that would hold the bar higher for the base level of
certification or perhaps hold the bar higher for only the platinum level. The
Kroon Building was just certified to be a platinum building, as an example. </p>
<p>So these are the
different kinds of certification programs that LEED has beneath its umbrella.
And as I mentioned, the first one, new construction and renovation, is the
subject of today's talk. But also, schools, core and shell components of
buildings, neighborhood development, retail facilities, healthcare facilities,
commercial interiors, and homes. Sorry, I've got a couple of duplicate slides
here. </p>
<p>So I'd like you to
think about sustainable sites. Credits can be awarded for building on
previously developed land. They give additional credits for minimizing impacts
on ecosystems and waterways, for promoting landscaping that is regionally
appropriate. So if for example, in the slide that I showed in Arizona, if you
were trying to get LEED certification for a new project, you would need to be
very careful about the kind of landscaping that you put in, making certain that
it wasn't water dependent. Whether or not the building site encourages access
to public transportation, so proximity say, to a rail station would improve the
number of points. The control of storm water runoff, and erosion. So as an
example there, Kroon Hall has a very large gutter that overhangs the south side
and funnels water down into that water garden that is on the eastern side of
the structure. Then that water moves through a filtration plant inside the
building, and then is recycled into gray water, so that it is used for removal
of human waste in the bathrooms. Well, also, here's an example of how that
building achieved certain points by the restoration program, digging out the old
contaminated lands and rebuilding. </p>
<p>So for each of these
categories, I'm not going to spend much time on this. But for each of the
categories, you can achieve points in different directions. And you can imagine
that the way that these points are allocated category by category could have a
pretty significant implication for providing encouragement. By the way, why
would a developer want to be LEED certified anyway? What's the value? Well, I
mentioned one value that would be to the building industry at large, which is
creating an incentive for a new line of products and a new approach to building
design that would create jobs and cause the industry to grow generally. But
most developers are in this because they know that if they achieve
certification and the property value is higher, they can demand a premium for
the structure or the complex. </p>
<p>So that in this case,
the sustainable sites category allows one to seek about twenty-three percent of
total number of credits that are possible. So that these can be awarded for
brownfield redevelopment, for alternative transportation, the bike storage area
that you find behind Osborne Laboratory caused FES to gain additional points.
The management of storm water, trying to manage a heat island effect, reduce
that intensity of heat absorption by creating green roofs. There was a green
roof that's on part of that site. Water efficiency also is a source of possible
points, about nine percent of the total. So that within this category,
appliance efficiency, fixtures and fittings are good examples of different ways
of saving water as well as the landscaping that I mentioned earlier. </p>
<p>And I wanted to
mention a couple of kind of relatively recent technological designs. One is
these leverless faucets that sense your presence, either by an electronic eye
or sensing heat that causes them to turn on and off. And it's kind of
interesting. You know, I have become more curious about this and watch people's
hand washing behavior, particularly in places like airports. And it's really
common to have a whole array of these things on a countertop. And people often
have to move from one the other to get one to work. And after that happens a
number of times, people I think are more likely just to not wash their hands.
So there's a sanitation problem that is potentially associated with it. If you
go into the men's rooms and look at the flushless urinals, you will immediately
recognize that there is a serious problem in Kroon. And it's led many to argue
that they really would rather make the tradeoff between the odor in the
bathroom that might otherwise be managed by improving the heating and
ventilation system. So that right now, no water is used in this toilet, only a
synthetic compound is put in to try to maintain its sanitation. But it often is
not as effective as it is promoted to be. </p>
<p>So that water
efficiency can be achieved in a variety of ways. The faucets themselves are
often fitted with restrictions in flow so that if you're interested in taking a
more powerful shower, you'll need to figure out how to get the flow restrictor
out, which many people do try. The flow restrictor itself is governed by local
and state building codes. And it was kind of interesting to me, it was an
education for me. When I wondered, I asked a plumber who was installing a new
faucet in my sink, and I said, you know, I really would like a larger rate of
flow in this sink so that I could be more effective in washing dishes or
whatever. And he said, well you know, you really don't understand the energy
implications of not restricting the flow. And if you thought about it, then
you'd realize that the energy costs are really quite high to move the water to
your home. And I said, &quot;Well, I've got my own well.&quot; He said,
&quot;Well think about where the energy is coming from that causes your pump to
lift the water 600 feet. And then also think about the more water that you use,
the more waste you create, so you're likely to disperse biological and chemical
contaminants more broadly.&quot; So my plumber gave me a lesson in environmental
behavior that I thought was quite valuable. </p>
<p>So the majority, not
the majority, but the highest proportion of points or credits are awarded under
the LEED program for energy and atmospheric concerns. So that new buildings can
obtain points by monitoring energy consumption, and this is being pretty
carefully done in Kroon Hall, as an example. And the orientation of the
building, of Kroon, it's facing east to west, so that it has more window space
on the south side to absorb more solar radiation. It also has solar panels that
run across the south side and a variety of other saving techniques. So that the
dominance of energy and energy conservation in the LEED certification and
credit program relative to these other categories is quite interesting. </p>
<p>With respect to
materials and resources, the management of waste is also more intensely
monitored within a LEED-certified building. And when a building is actually
certified, it's not certified forever, it's certified for a fixed period of
time, often only a single year. And a building is not certified until it can
demonstrate that it has performed at a level of X during that year. So it's
kind of an interesting idea. If a building's heating and ventilation system
malfunctions, then a year or two down the road, it's not going to be
recertified. </p>
<p>Indoor environmental
quality is increasingly a concern, and only fifteen points compared to about
thirty-four points in the energy category. Only fifteen points are allocated
for indoor environmental quality. Now, what does that mean? It generally means
a concern for the chemical content of the indoor environment. But it also
includes the opportunity to gain points for natural daylight and views, and
also for acoustical control, noise control, so that the situation that we're experiencing
here might be avoided. Now, you know, again, think about the importance of this
in terms of human chemical exposure given the fact that we spend so much time
indoors. You know this diagram is now a couple of years old. But in the latter
part of the 1990s, EPA was estimating that about eighty-six, eighty-seven
percent of time was spent indoors, about five percent of time was spent in a
vehicle. So thinking about the chemical content of the indoor environment is
important, especially for certain subgroups, like kids. </p>
<p>This can be managed
in a variety of ways. And you could think, well, the ventilation rate or the
air exchange rate, indoor to outdoor, is one way of doing that, depending upon
where your building is. So in general, outdoor air quality is better than
indoor air quality, unless you live in proximity to an industrial area or to a
highway. So that being able to mechanically and individually control windows is
an important strategy for managing air quality. </p>
<p>But also thinking
about a variety of different materials and compounds that are brought into the
built environment, so that some compounds and some products are discouraged
under this program. So that paints, for example, that emit a high level of
volatile organic compounds are discouraged. So low emitting paints, varnishes,
polyurethanes, are now designated. So that if you look at the can of oil-based
paint, you'll find that roughly two and a half pounds of volatile organic
compounds are contained. Whereas certain paints are now manufactured with no
volatile organic compounds. </p>
<p>You might also think
about the compact fluorescents that pose kind of an interesting problem in that
they contain mercury. So that this is a piece of personal advice for you, as
you install or remove compact fluorescents, be really careful about them.
Because if they break in your room, it's going to scatter mercury around, and
the mercury will vaporize. If it gets into a rug and you vacuum the rug, the
rug is going to give off the mercury vapors, and it will increase the
volatilization rate. And it will be just about impossible to completely remove
the mercury from the room. So this is a problem associated with the compact
fluorescents that is turning into a rather interesting and serious dilemma for
waste management. So not many people really want to take an old burned out
light bulb back to a recycling center. In fact, the probability of getting it
there without breaking it is probably not too great. </p>
<p>And also, think about
again, plastics and landfill. An increasing proportion of the interior built
environment is made up of a variety of plastics that we've talked about in the
past. But the extremely low chance that plastics are going to be recycled is a
logic to rethink the way that points are allocated. There was an interesting
debate inside the Green Building Council about polyvinylchloride plastics and
whether or not PVCs ought to be either banned or whether or not you would have
credits removed if you used PVC, as opposed to a more recyclable product like
polyethylene, that most soda bottles are made out of. But they decided not to
do that, which is quite curious. </p>
<p>So thinking about the
kinds of materials that are put down on floors, the sealants also. This is
encouraged. Credits can be gained if you choose not just the low VOC paints,
but also the clear finishes. Also, you'll find a variety of products, including
this type of a vinyl flooring that you could see in Kroon Hall, particularly in
the stairwells, that gives off volatile compounds that I haven't been able to
identify and the manufacturers are not required to label. So think about the
variety of different products that go into the construction of a building, and
how these products may change the chemical content of that environment. </p>
<p>So that the quality
of the air exchange system is really critical to govern the chemical exposures
that occur. And this is particularly the case in a new building. As an example,
rugs. Rugs may be made out of natural products, natural fibers, such as wool or
cotton or now increasingly some reed material from South America. But rugs that
are made out of synthetic compounds and their backing, many are recommending
that those be aired out in a warehouse or in a garage for a period of time, up
to a couple weeks before they're installed so that occupants of new buildings
would not be exposed to those fumes. </p>
<p>A couple of other
examples that are not managed by LEED. Certain golf courses have been
certified. Whereas the expectation on the part of the Green Building Council is
that the chemicals that are used are regulated by the Environmental Protection
Agency. And the chemicals that are used on golf courses are commonly quite a
complex mixture. And as you remember from the pesticide section of the course,
many of these have not been fully tested. A variety of insulating materials
also can expose workers at levels that are potentially hazardous to their
health. So that some acrylics, for example, that play an important role in
increasing the energy efficiency of a building, but they can lead to worker
exposure situations. </p>
<p>So thinking about
whether or not LEED should get involved in concern about the production of the
chemical and its application and the way that it's actually used to build a
building is interesting. LEED has also certified a bottling plant, raising kind
of an interesting question. Well, what if say DuPont Corporation wanted to
build a plant to produce a variety of chemicals that were extremely hazardous,
and perhaps they got into water or air or soil. Should they be allowed to get
platinum or LEED certification for that structure? Should Nestle be allowed to
gain certification for marketing products that are not likely to be recycled? </p>
<p>Here's another
example of a project that was certified in Florida. And you remember the lecture
last week about barrier islands. Well, this owner owns the tract of land
slicing across a barrier island from the bay to the shoreline, and obviously,
has quite intensively developed it. You know, seeing the amount of square
footage in homes and the low occupancy rates has led me to wonder about whether
or not the government might think about regulating square foot per person or
cubic foot per person. I mean, how much space do we really need per person? </p>
<p>So I'm going to run
through just a few summary of findings here before I close today that should
give you a sense of what's working and what's not working too well with the LEED
program. These standards have been designed by a voluntary nonprofit
organization. But they've been adopted increasingly at all levels of government
in law. So they've been added to Connecticut's laws, for example. So that
Connecticut now requires that new buildings that are going to cost more than
five million dollars need LEED certification. Many of the Department of
Energy's programs are now designed to encourage giving of grants to projects
that gain LEED certification or would gain LEED certification. And many local
governments are now adopting these standards. So that what's happening here is
that the standards are being developed by a voluntary nonprofit organization
really to promote a new form of growth and development. But they're being
incorporated wholesale into a variety of different levels of government without
really thinking critically about what's working well and what's not. </p>
<p>There's now no
federal definition of what a green building standard should be. Clearly this
program gives a higher priority to energy efficiency over indoor environmental
quality or human health. And if I were going to design a statute that would
encourage green building, it would certainly give increased precedence to
public health concerns and the chemical content of buildings. The Green
Building Council has very little expertise in human health, and that in part
explains why these standards are not well developed in that area. Still, the
green certification program, the LEED program, gives a false impression of
healthy buildings. And tighter buildings are more energy efficient, but tighter
buildings also more effectively contain chemicals that get into indoor air. So
that no level of certification, even the highest level, the platinum rating,
assures health protection. LEED also neglects drinking water, so that drinking
water supplies are managed in the nation predominantly by the Safe Drinking
Water Act and the maximum contaminant level standards. So there is no
requirement under LEED to filter water, despite the fact that many water lines
are capable of transmitting not just metals but also some of the components of
plastics. So that the core problem with respect to managing chemicals in the
indoor environment and the ultimate life cycle of chemicals has to do with
Congress's inactivity, its failure to demand that chemicals that are used in
the building industry be labeled, that they be tested before they're used. So
that it's creating a pattern of exposure that really we don't understand well.
We know we're being exposed to a brand new mixture of compounds. </p>
<p>So what kinds of
recommendations might you think about to improve this system? Well one would be
to simplify the scoring system so that rather than using the platinum, the gold
standards, I would prefer to see a scale that was simply a zero to one hundred
scale so that people would not have the incentive just to get to eighty points
so that that would ensure that they would be awarded the platinum
certification. I think that the categories of certification need to be
diversified so that if the Green Building Council judged and scored a project's
performance in separate categories, developers would have an incentive to score
higher in all those categories. In other words, set up a separate scoring
system for indoor environmental quality and human health. Set up a separate
system for energy efficiency. Set up a separate system for water supply. But
whether or not we want to have this system managed by a nonprofit organization
that is run by the board of directors that have predominately for-profit
organizations, that's another basic question. So should the federal government
take this over? </p>
<p>So this system is not
designed in its current form to encourage the use of safer chemicals in the
building industry. So that what kinds of innovations might encourage builders
to want to buy building products that contain safer products? Well, they would
certainly need to know what the chemicals were in the products so that there's
a labeling issue that needs to be confronted. But also, there's a testing issue
as well. The Green Building Council also has the opportunity not to disclose
the results of its building performance tests. So that the public really has no
opportunity to hold the Green Building Council accountable for its declaration
of performance in different categories. </p>
<p>So I think I'll close
with the thought that this is a very interesting historical example of how
certification standards evolved in a nonprofit organization that really is
representing for-profit industries, the large building products industry, the
major building companies, large architectural firms and engineering firms. And
this program has no accountability at all to the United States public, at the
same time that it's being built into law at all levels of government. So
something seems really very much out of whack. And it demands I think a pretty
careful review. One critical improvement could be made if minimum performance
criteria were set within each of the specified categories: sustainable sites,
energy, the category for indoor environmental quality. So that if there were
minimum and protective standards set inside those categories, it would go a
long way to meeting some of the objections I just raised. Okay. Thank you very
much. We'll come back to larger questions of community design on Thursday.</p>
