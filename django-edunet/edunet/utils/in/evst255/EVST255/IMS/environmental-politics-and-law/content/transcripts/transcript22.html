<p><strong>Professor John Wargo:
</strong>So today, I want to
explore the problem that we face, which is much more than a dilemma, it's a
quad-lemma in a way, or a quint-lemma of how we manage our future energy
demands and how we invest our resources in alternative forms of energy. And I'm
going to spend most of this session talking about the possibilities and
limitations of nuclear power. And this will provide a foundation for the
lecture on next Tuesday, which will be particularly directed at wind, but more
broadly at renewables.</p>
<p>So first, I'd like to
have you consider the distribution of nuclear power plants in the world and
really reflect on where they're not located, and their high concentration,
particularly in the Eastern, Midwestern part of the United States, but also in
Europe. So within the U.S. you see that they're really concentrated up in the
Northeast, but also south in nearby Chicago. And California is quite striking
in that in 1976 the State of California enacted a moratorium against new
nuclear power plant development.</p>
<p>If you look more
closely at Europe, and particularly at France, you can see a very high
dependence in some nations in the European Union on nuclear power. France now
receives approximately seventy-five percent of its power from nuclear plants.
And inside the United States, also there's quite a bit of variability in reliance
on nuclear. So in Connecticut, for example, nearly sixty-five percent of the
power that we consume in the state comes from nuclear plants in Niantic, which
is about forty-five miles to the east of us on the Thames River from the
Millstone nuclear power plants. So it's quite curious how different parts of
the country, different economies, have treated nuclear power. And explaining
the cultural predisposition to accept the risks and accept the costs is not an
easy thing to do.</p>
<p>So just so you have
an overview of the status of the nuclear industry in the world, there are about
436 different reactors that are operating in thirty different countries. Fifty
reactors are now under construction, mostly in Asian nations. And within the
U.S., there are proposals for twenty new reactors. And of these, four to eight
may be online in 2020. China has eleven online at present, with twenty-two
under construction, and is the nation where nuclear development is most rapid
in the world. Within the U.S., the operating licenses that have had limits
placed on them of operating licenses between thirty and forty years, most of
these are going to be granted operating extensions. And the concern was that
the plant or the infrastructure would not have the capability of lasting longer
than forty years at the outside. But they're finding that the engineering
integrity of many of the plants is higher than they thought it might be. But
this basically is a short-term lease on the problem of decommissioning these
nuclear plants and also what we'll be talking about in a few moments, which
will be the problem of managing nuclear waste.</p>
<p>The MIT report, the
faculty report that was issued in 2003 and then recently updated that we asked
you to read has some really I think important lessons and conclusions embedded
within it. So they concluded that after five years from 2003, so this is two
years ago, no new plants are under construction in the United States, and
insufficient progress has been made on waste management. The sober warning is
that if more is not done, nuclear power will diminish as a practical and timely
option for climate change risk mitigation.</p>
<p>So as one thinks
about what are options are, particularly coal, as opposed to investments in
renewables, as opposed to investments in nuclear power, one might think about
it as a problem of relative cost. But you also might think about relative risk
and ease of bringing additional capacity online given the different sources.
And underlying this, I think, is an underestimated cultural factor, which is
what we worry about in the United States, and our predisposition to remember
not just Chernobyl, but also what happened at Three Mile Island in 1979. The
capital costs of constructing a new plant are often enormous. And because so
much can go wrong, including construction delays that can cause interest rates
to rise and the amount that has to be paid back to investors to rise, it's
caused what's thought of as a risks premium being put on an investment funds.
So banks or private investment companies often will loan the money to a utility
company that wants to build a new plant, but they will do so at a higher rate
when it's measured by kilowatt hour. And so there's about a two cent per
kilowatt hour difference between nuclear compared to coal and natural gas,
which makes this a very, very expensive proposition. Basically, the money costs
more.</p>
<p>The legal and
regulatory structure that surrounds nuclear power is rather complex. The
initial statute that governed what now exists was the Atomic Energy Act back in
1954 that we discussed a bit during the beginning of the term when we were
talking about atmospheric weapons testing. But now, recall that the technology,
that the science and engineering foundation for nuclear power plants, really
evolved out of the nuclear weapons development program. So many of the nuclear
power plants that were the earliest versions, say at Hanford or at Oakridge in
Tennessee, these plants were first generation, but they were designed
predominantly to provide enriched fuel for atomic weapons. This defines both
state and federal authority concerning nuclear energy. And it really was the
watershed that ended the monopoly, the government monopoly on nuclear
technology. And it gave the private sector a role in nuclear development, and
expressly prohibited states from any role in transfer, delivery, receipt,
acquisition, possession, or use of nuclear materials. And it also gave the
Atomic Energy Commission the exclusive authority to manage these issues.</p>
<p>What is interesting
about the history of the AEC is that they were both the promoters of the
technology and the developers of the technology, and they were supposed to be
the regulators. So the fox watching the henhouse, so to speak. And this was
recognized quite early in the history of the AEC, when Congress decided to
break off the responsibilities associated with regulation to have a higher
probability of safety and environmental protection and worker safety. So that
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was given these responsibilities. So this is
an independent agency now that has commissioners assigned to it that make
choices about issuing licensing decisions and about safety violations or
environmental violations associated with the industry. So that states have
retained authority over electric power generation, sale, and transmission.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the
development of the nuclear industry which is important to know is that this is
not being protected by private insurance companies. The Price Anderson Nuclear
Industries Indemnity Act really holds the industry harmless from damage claims
in the event of a serious accident. And it also sets up a procedure for
compensation that has criteria that are really pretty clear, that those that
claim damage have to show what it was, they have to calculate their monetary
loss, and they also have to demonstrate causality that is relatively easy to
demonstrate in this case because of a specific isotope mixture signature that
would come from any sort of a nuclear explosion or an accident.</p>
<p>So the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission was created in 1974. Now, you can imagine also that many states
might be more worried about nuclear power than other states. And California is
really a pretty good example of that. So that in 1976, the State of California
created a moratorium on new nuclear power plant construction. So states might
have the authority to do that. And until the federal government approved of
methods to dispose of high level waste, the State of California was really
quite concerned about what the long-term costs might be to manage that waste,
and also what the long-term costs might be associated with decommissioning the
plant. So the Pacific Gas and Electric Company argued that the Congressional
intent to preempt state regulation of the nuclear industry was implicit in the
Atomic Energy Act. So again, preemption is a critical legal tool that the
industry relied upon in order to claim that the State of California did not
have authority to create this moratorium.</p>
<p>So the Supreme Court
eventually ruled on this case, and its finding is quite interesting. The
federal government possesses exclusive regulatory authority over construction
and operation of nuclear facilities and over radiological safety. And the
states hold authority over decisions concerning the need for additional
generating facilities, licensing, ratemaking, land use, and planning. And the
Supreme Court argued that federal law would preempt the moratorium if it was
related to safety concerns.</p>
<p>So that's an
interesting idea. The federal government would be the experts in the area of
risk assessment and environmental assessment. Thank you, Emily Jack-Scott. You
seem to have been quite successful, persuasive. So that if it's related to
safety concerns, the court argued that California did not have the authority to
establish a moratorium because it was worried about health effects or
environmental dangers. But it concluded that the federal law would not preempt
a moratorium if California's logic was based on economics. So if they were
worried about cost considerations down the road. So a very interesting
distinction that allowed this moratorium to be sustained. California's
assertion that the legislature had enacted the moratorium based upon economic
concerns was eventually accepted.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Waste
Policy Act of 1982 is important because most nuclear waste had been and is now
being stored in or nearby nuclear power plants. So it's highly dispersed around
the country. Think back on the U.S. map that I showed you with the different
dots of the location of the plants. That's where the nuclear spent fuel, the
fuel rods, that are highly radioactive, are being stored. Within Connecticut,
this would include the Haddam Neck Nuclear Power Plant that's now been closed
that's about twenty miles from Yale to the east, and it would also include the
three Millstone plants over in Niantic. So that under this statute, the
Department of Energy was granted the authority to begin to centralize a nuclear
fuel reprocessing and repository. So basically, just a storage facility where
this waste could be handled until it might be reprocessed. But they were unable
to open the facility, and by an amendment, the site at Yucca Mountain was
established by DOE to be the single repository.</p>
<p>So you can imagine
that if you were the State of Nevada, you probably would not be too happy about
that. But if you were the State of California, Connecticut, or any other state
that had nuclear power plants, you'd be really happy about the prospect of
getting rid of the waste that's sitting inside your state boundary. So this
prompted a lot of litigation. Litigation on the part of Nevada, that did not
want the repository to be located there. And litigation on the part of other
states, including the State of Washington, most recently, arguing that they
wanted their waste taken to this power plant and that the Obama administration
did not have the right to decide that this storage facility should not open.</p>
<p>When one thinks about
the location of either the plants or the storage facilities, you need to think
carefully about evacuation requirements. So before the Three Mile Island
accident in Pennsylvania, the emergency response plans by nuclear power plants
in the U.S. were voluntary. That's quite striking, given what the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission understood about the potential
for these nuclides to move over long distances, being transported in the air.
Now, the plans have to cover a ten-mile radius. Now think about that. Ten
miles, would that be sufficient? Well, we're about twenty miles from the
nearest nuclear power plant here. But if you think about the Indian Point
Nuclear Power Plant outside of New York City, then you need to think about the
capacity to move tens of millions of people away from a zone that would likely
be highly contaminated in the event of a meltdown or an explosion or a serious
fire, such as existed at Three Mile Island or at Chernobyl. So the Indian Point
facility prompted Governor Pataki to commission a report to evaluate the
evacuation plan, and criticized the communication between local agencies, the
size of the area that would be affected by release, and the plan's premise is
that an orderly evacuation, rather than mass panic, would likely ensue.</p>
<p>It's kind of
interesting, because if you drive around Connecticut within ten miles of the
nuclear power plants, occasionally, you'll see a sign on the side of the road,
sometimes very rural roads, that notify the public that this is part of an
evacuation route in the event of a nuclear accident. So that the capacity to
move people away from a contaminated zone, to be able to predict how that zone
might vary given weather patterns, it really is quite limited. Also, there was
no consideration of the probability or likelihood of a terrorist attack at
these plants. And this raised the possibility that there ought to be aerial
surveillance, that there ought to be planes that are flying nearby these
nuclear power plants, as there was shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attack in
New York. So that the Commission reported that "Any plant adjacent to high
population areas should have different requirements than plants otherwise
situated because protective actions are more difficult and the consequences of
a failure or delay are higher." And the "planning problems are more
serious because of the large population concentrations."</p>
<p>So I'm going to jump
ahead here. The core problem associated with waste is radioactive half-life.
And the key concern is over plutonium. And there are 270 tons of separated
plutonium from reprocessing of fuel rods around the world that now are sitting
at sites and being stored. And it has a half-life of roughly 24,000 years. So
when engineers and safety experts were thinking about the problem posed by
Yucca Mountain, this is the mountain in Nevada where the storage facility has
been partially constructed, using about nine billion dollars of taxpayers'
money. So that the problem really here was how do you ensure the integrity of a
storage facility for nearly a million years?</p>
<p>And they chose this
site because of its remoteness. Poor Nevada. Remember, Nevada was also the site
of the Atmospheric Weapons Testing Facility, the largest and most often used in
the U.S. And they designed a machine that would bore into the rock and create a
tunnel within which either canisters would be stored as dry fuel, or they could
be stored in water. So the fuel is highly radioactive, and it's cooled in pools
of water or in these dry casks. And it's currently stored at sixty-six sites in
the U.S. This is what one of the storage facilities might look like. And that
honeycombed set of boxes that you can barely see in the bottom of the pool over
here, that's how they store the fuel rods, side by side. By the way, it also
creates radioactive water so that the amount of liquid waste that is
contaminated is far larger in volume than the amount of waste that is either
low level or high level waste.</p>
<p>So it was also
curious that if you're projecting out a risk management strategy over tens of
thousands or hundreds of thousands of years, you know what happens if something
occurs and society no longer speaks a language that is understood today? What
if some massive accident occurred, nuclear war or whatever it is, that leads
whatever society exists that stumbles across this plant to recognize it? Kind
of interesting. In a way, it was a labeling issue. How do you communicate risk,
not using language, but using symbols instead?</p>
<p>So the Department of
Energy commissioned anthropologists to think about different forms of symbolism.
And they went back and looked at what symbols would best convey the idea that
there was something extremely dangerous nearby or to stay away. And the
symbolism that is chosen is not represented here. But the nuclear symbols that
you see in the upper right hand side of this slide are those that are commonly
used by the nuclear industry. But you can imagine if you did not know the
culture today, if you'd never seen any symbol on the side of a truck, for
example, sometimes trucks have some of these symbols that you wouldn't have any
idea what this meant. The symbols on the lower right are symbols that are
commonly applied for industrial and worker safety situations, whereas the
symbol on the left is several hundred years old.</p>
<p>So that I mentioned a
lawsuit. This most recent lawsuit this year, this spring, by <em>Washington
State v. The Department of Energy</em>, was designed to encourage the federal
government to keep the Yucca Mountain Repository viable. "The Attorney
General McKenna made the right decision to file his lawsuit today to stop the
Administration from closing down Yucca Mountain."</p>
<p>Now, another problem
with nuclear power is the potential for proliferation of nuclear weapons. So
one might think that we need to think about an international strategy to control
the distribution of nuclear fuel. So processed nuclear fuel could be further
enriched to form a weapon grade that could produce nuclear weapons. So the
International Atomic Energy Agency and several other private organizations
banded together to encourage the creation of a nuclear fuel bank so that the G8
has been proposed to constitute this bank and be responsible for the
dissemination of nuclear fuel and then for its recovery once it's spent. In
this way, they would have a collaborative attempt to try to manage the fuel.</p>
<p>Thinking also about
the MIT faculty's conclusions regarding safety, they ended their report saying
that parallel with improved operations, the safety record of the nuclear
industry has really been quite remarkable in the last twenty years. And it
plays-- the "nuclear power industry displays by far the highest capacity
factor among all generation technologies, providing now about twenty percent of
the U.S. electrical supply." So that the belief is that most reactors,
particularly the latest generation reactors, have the capacity to operate
safely, but that the probability of bringing them online in a way that would
make a significant difference in the world with respect to effects of energy
consumption and climate change is really quite limited. So that with respect to
the enrichment problem, for example, uranium, when it's mined, is approximately
point seven percent uranium-235, but it needs to have that increased to four to
five percent in order for it to be useable as fuel in a nuclear power plant,
compared to twenty percent that it has to be for nuclear devices.</p>
<p>The Three Mile Island
example in 1979 created quite a bit of alarm in the United States, and it was
also a time when a movie came out called <em>The China Syndrome</em> that
dramatized the effects of a nuclear accident in an urban area. And the nuclear
facility at Three Mile Island experienced what was about a sixty percent
meltdown. And like most major accidents, whether or not it's the space shuttle
that blew up or the Bhopal incident in India, where it's estimated that more
than 100,000 people were killed in a chemical plant explosion, or in Chernobyl,
many people think about the problem being assigned to and caused by technical
failure, technology failure, hardware failure. When in fact, it's almost always
human failure, human failure to monitor equipment effectively. And that was
certainly the case at Three Mile Island, when workers mistook the need to open
a valve to allow cooling water to go in and cool down the fuel rods that were heating
up. So in Bhopal, it was a problem of gauges. With the space shuttle blowing
up, it was a problem of misrecognizing the heat shield tiles that had fallen
off, and that were highly temperature sensitive. So that the shuttle took off
during temperature conditions that some recognized made it dangerous.</p>
<p>So the case history
that is most important I think for us to think about, which caused the greatest
amount of environmental damage in history with respect to a nuclear power plant
occurred at the Chernobyl plant in Pripyat, then within the Soviet Union. And
this occurred in April of 1986 and occurred during a yearly maintenance
operation, where they were pursuing a gradual power reduction. And they
basically lost control of their maintenance efforts. And the control rods were
removed too quickly, and then the power shot back down too low, and the water
in the plant was turned in an improper direction. The workers were confused
about what to do. The power surged 1,500 times its safe level within five seconds,
and a steel shield on the roof of the building was blown into the sky, and the
entire facility caught fire for a period of several weeks.</p>
<p>So four days later,
after the Soviet Union has maintained their silence, the government announced,
"An accident has occurred at the Chernobyl Atomic Power Station. One of
the nuclear reactors has been damaged. Measures are being taken to eliminate
the consequence of the accident, aid is being given to the victims, and a
government commission has been established." So anyone who knows anything
about industrial accidents or nuclear power plants would recognize that being
able to warn the public immediately after an accident was exceptionally
important.</p>
<p>The only nuclear
event that this could be compared to was one at Windscale, now known as
Sellafield, in the northern part of Great Britain, where in 1956, there was a
fire in the plant and a significant amount of radiation was released into the
air. And the workers of the plant went out and commandeered the tractors and cars
of farmers that lived in the surrounding area. And the farmers were standing in
the field watching these workers basically drive away in a caravan as quickly
as they could so that they could reduce their exposure. Again, no government
warning, no attempts to evacuate the area. So that the failure to take action
soon after an accident like this results in the population being exposed at the
highest levels.</p>
<p>So the Soviets then
disclosed "a certain leak of radioactive substances," and then
finally told the public that 200 people were hospitalized, but that the water
and the air in Kiev were safe. They were reassuring the public in fact, at the
same time that their air force was seeding the clouds in the area, trying to
induce rain so that it could wash the radiation from the sky before it reached
the Russian state and also to protect the reservoir that is to the north of
Kiev. So finally, President Gorbachev in '86 came on the news one evening and
said, "Good evening, comrades. All of you know that there's been an
incredible misfortune. The accident at the Chernobyl plant has painfully
affected the Soviet people and shocked the international community, and for the
first time, we confront the real force of nuclear energy out of control."</p>
<p>There are a variety of
different stories and lessons here, but perhaps the one that is most sad is the
way that workers were mistreated. The effects of being exposed to radiation in
the absence of protective gear was very well known to the Atomic Energy
Commission and to the Soviet scientific experts from their experiences with
nuclear weapons. But other than potassium iodide pills and the normal kind of a
suit that a fireman might wear as protective gear, they were left helpless,
even though they were told to go in and try to put out the flames of the
burning and charring fuel rods.</p>
<p>So also, the Soviets
and others misunderstood the pattern of distribution of the radionuclides once
they reached the atmosphere. So here you see April 26, the white that you see
in the right hand side of the upper left air photo here, is demonstrating the
direction of the plume. By April 28, the plume had reached up over Norway,
Sweden, and Finland. By April 30, you can tell that the plume was being
dispersed and being blown back around northern Europe. And eventually, by May
6, it had scattered itself pretty much all over Europe, with a patchy kind of a
concentration.</p>
<p>And you remember the
surprise on the part of the Atomic Energy Commission to the patchiness of the
fallout, finding high levels of strontium-90 in New York and Connecticut when
the cloud intercepted a rainstorm. And this affected a fallout pattern that was
really quite similarly non-uniform in Europe. And it took roughly about ten
days for this plume to make its way all the way around the world, moving across
China and then the Pacific Ocean to reach the United States, when it became
detectable in the milk supplies in states such as Utah and Arizona and
California. So that the sensors that existed at that point in time were picking
up contaminants eventually distributed around the United States and eventually
the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So as you look at
this map, you see a radiation deposition gradient from lightest color to
darkest color. And what's so striking about it is that you see the patchiness
demonstrated here, where you have a significant deposition in Austria, a
significant deposition in Finland and up in both Norway and in Sweden. And the
distance, by the way, is probably about 600 to 700 miles, maybe about 800
miles, from Chernobyl up to Northern Europe. So one thing that this did was it
created complete chaos in European food markets. So if it reached the ground,
it was getting into the food supply. Well, they realized that the different
nations all had separate radiation standards. So that they did not have a
uniform regulatory system to protect against one nation selling one commodity
that had a radiation level that might not be accepted by another nation that
had a tougher standard. Also, the detection process, you can imagine that the
government was slow to go out and try to figure out this patchiness with
precision. And that had tremendous implications for the period of exposure by
the population.</p>
<p>So here's a good
example of the distributional pattern as it was being recognized by the Soviet
Union back in the late 1980s. And as they tested more, they found more. So that
this map was constantly changing in response to more rigorous testing. So that
the different zones that you see here are designated as confiscated areas, permanent
control areas, period control areas, and unregulated areas. So that the darkest
red are the confiscated areas. So that lands, agricultural lands, urban lands,
homes, residential communities, commercial areas, were literally confiscated so
that hundreds of thousands of people were moved off of their land because the
soils, the plants, as well as the building materials, and even the vehicles,
were contaminated. Hundreds of thousands of vehicles turned into hazardous
waste, almost within a matter of days. So what to do with this area? What do
you do with people that you're going to pull out of their homes? Well, they had
to build new communities. And in some instances, they even built new
communities in areas that were contaminated because they hadn't tested
carefully enough. Kind of interesting, because it should ring bells with you
with respect to the Bikini Island history, where the Bikinians were allowed to
move back into an area that the government supplied funds for constructing new
homes, and then they went in and tested that more carefully and found that they
had to move out.</p>
<p>So that the tension
here is that the government will want to limit its own liability, its own costs
for evacuating or for dealing with hazardous waste, or for rebuilding a community.
So it has very little incentive to disclose with precision the intensity of the
concentrations. So in this case, the precision grew in response to
international pressure because they were finding the patchy highly contaminated
areas in many different European communities. And those different countries
wanted to have international authority to take the Soviet Union to court so
that they could be compensated for their losses as well. The construction
workers that were trying to put out the fire and then deal with the
contaminated areas would drive vehicles in whether they were aircraft, whether
or not they were cars or trucks such as this. The workers eventually were
suited up in protective gear, and they had to wash down the vehicles as they
left the site to keep the vehicles from tracking the radionuclides to different
parts of the affected area.</p>
<p>I mentioned that
agricultural lands were obviously affected, especially those within the red
zones on the map that you just saw. What do you do with contaminated lands like
this? Well, you basically have to scrape the surface off of it and figure out
how you're going to bury the contaminated material. So that think about this,
76,000 thousand square kilometers of contaminated land.</p>
<p>And what about the
forest lands? What would happen to the timber that were growing in the area?
Well, they also absorb the radionuclides. And many of those trees were still
standing. And many people would cut down the contaminated trees, cut the
timber, saw it up, turn it into building material, and people would build their
houses of it. There's a similar analogy to the way that the uranium mines
created the fuel for the power plants, the way that those mines left waste of
uranium mine tailings. So what did they do with that? Well in some instances,
they used the mine tailings as a construction material for homes, particularly
on Native American reservations. So there's a very unhappy and costly history
of how Navajos were living in homes that were built from cement products that contained
uranium.</p>
<p>So that the enormity
of the effect of the contamination was just beyond anybody's expectation. Cars,
trucks, tanks had to be buried. And there are many stories about how cars would
be buried at night. They'd be dug up before dawn, and parts from those cars
would then be removed and sold on the black market. So you all know that
there's a very robust used car part market virtually everywhere in the world.
So that these radioactive used parts were brought back, recycled back into
circulation.</p>
<p>In Sweden it's
interesting. Because the Swedes found out about this, not because they were
notified by the Soviets or any other nation, but because their workers showed
up at their nuclear power plants and they started setting off alarms. So that
power plants in Sweden were shut down one after another, but not because there
was a problem at their plant, but because their workers were walking in the
door to the plant in the morning and they had picked up the radionuclides that
had been deposited on the streets or the sidewalks in Sweden, and that
contamination had set off the alarms. That's when they started looking at
weather patterns and trying to figure out what the source might be. There was
no evidence that a nuclear weapon had been detonated, so they started at the
location of nuclear power plants and were able to piece together the weather
pattern over the past several days to pinpoint the Chernobyl plant. So that
within several days, the radiation in Sweden was 1,000 times higher than it
previously had been.</p>
<p>So I'm going to jump
ahead here to a discussion about evacuation. Civil defense officials were
finally able to convince the government and plant officials of the need to
evacuate areas that were closest to the plant. But thirty-six hours had passed.
And these are, if you look at the current charts about the periodicity of the
release of the radiation, you find that this first thirty-six hours was a
crucial period, when that population should not have been allowed to stay in
the area. So that they really had no plan. The government eventually was able
to put together 1,000 buses and picked up first the children and then moved
them hundreds of miles away to different camps.</p>
<p>So as they studied
the pattern of deposition, they found that their evacuation zone had been
defined too narrowly. So the evacuation zone had to be continually expanded. So
that by May 3, this was only about six or seven days later, 45,000 residents
had been evacuated from a ten-kilometer radius. Eventually, 210,000 people were
resettled into less contaminated areas. By the way, if you take the United
States' requirement that every nuclear power plant in our nation have an
evacuation plan that would cover an area that is defined by a ten-mile radius
and you compare it to the movement of contamination from this plant, you can
see the ten-mile radius in green here compared to the eventual location of the
deep red colored confiscation zones more than a hundred miles away.</p>
<p>So I'm going to jump
ahead here because I'm going to run out of time. The safety regulations varied
quite highly among the different nations, leading to a chaotic set of bans. So
that finally, the Europeans decided to ban meat, live animals, and produce from
all areas within 1,000 kilometers of the site. The economic consequences were
enormous. So that the Austrian government banned the import of East Block milk,
fruit and vegetables, the Dutch Agricultural Ministry prohibited cattle
grazing. The Swiss were warned against providing fresh milk to young children.
Italy banned the sale of its own leafy vegetables. And even the U.S. was
warning people not to go to several European nations because of the extent of
the contamination. So the economic consequences just associated with the food
supply and its contamination were far higher than anybody imagined.</p>
<p>There's also a sad
story about the Sami indigenous group in northern Sweden that have long relied
upon the livestock of reindeer. And reindeer feed on moss and lichen, and the
radionuclides built up heavily in the moss and lichen and were detectable in
their meat within a matter of several days following the accident. So that the
Swedish government decided that it was going to ban the sale of all future
products from these animals except for the sale of furs.</p>
<p>So to come to a
conclusion here, you'll be able to study this slide not from this lecture, but
up on the Classes server. So that if you think about the relative amount of
radioactivity that was released by the first atomic bombs in curies, you see
the first atomic bombs up here on the top at Nagasaki and Hiroshima having
released about 250,000 curies from atomic weapons testing totally. During that
period, the atmospheric weapons testing, those figures are given here. But then
if you look down here at Chernobyl, you find that the estimates of exposure and
the estimates of those exposed are really quite amazing. Seventeen thousand and
four hundred fatal cancers were expected among 2.9 billion people exposed. So
more than half of the world's population was exposed to fallout from this
nuclear power plant explosion, with a very serious estimate of fatal cancer
outcomes. Compared to the Atomic Weapons Testing Program, where among everybody
at the time--this report was done back in the 1990s by the National Cancer
Institute--everybody in the world was anticipated to have been exposed, but
only 12,000 fatal cancers were expected from that entire program. So the
magnitude of exposure, the magnitude of risk, is associated with this kind of a
failure, has long been underestimated.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to
leave you at this time with one other thought, because I opened the lecture
saying that we're facing a very difficult decision on how to allocate our
resources and investments in different kinds of fuels. And I want you to think
too about the relative risks associated with coal-fired power plants. We don't
have too much time to talk about coal. But coal produces not just sulfur and
nitrogen oxides, it produces particulates. And particulates, particularly in
combination-- particulates, particularly, sorry. Particulates in combination
with the sulfates pose a very serious health threat.</p>
<p>And many people don't
realize that between 20,000 and 60,000 premature deaths in the United States
alone every year are now attributable to coal-fired power plants. On a world
scale, the number is far more significant. So these are deaths that are
premature deaths, particularly among those that have background conditions of
cardiovascular illness or other kinds of respiratory illnesses. So that
premature deaths from this form of energy are far higher than have ever been
accounted for with respect to the nuclear industry. So that coal has this image
of being a relatively safe fuel compared to nuclear power. But I'm hoping to
get you to rethink that. The nuclear waste issue I think is overwhelmingly
persuasive to me that the nuclear industry should not be seriously encouraged.
And I am disappointed and surprised by the Obama Administration's support that
came out just a few weeks ago for it.</p>
<p>And next Tuesday, we'll
be talking about the future of renewables, and particularly, the different
kinds of legal strategies that have been employed, including tax strategies,
different subsidies, different kind of credit systems, in order to try to
increase human investment in renewable sources. So have a great weekend and
enjoy the weather.</p>
