<p><strong>Professor John Wargo:
</strong>I wanted to continue talking about property rights
and the environment, and also to talk more about public lands and natural
resource management problems. And I wanted to pick up on some of the questions
that were raised on Tuesday with respect to the property regime that was
created by the State of New York in the Adirondack Park. And part of the
problem with encouraging people to behave in accordance with law is their
perception of legitimacy of the purpose of the law. How consistent are their
values with the values that are embedded in law as a mission statement?</p>
<p>&nbsp;So what factors can
you imagine would influence your perception of the legitimacy of a new
regulation? One thing might be the way that you might have been allowed to
participate or were excluded from the decision making process to set up a new
rule to begin with. Another might be resistance, annoyance or a perception of
immorality that some other group or individual is imposing their values on you.</p>
<p>So one way to think
about the history of the Adirondack Park is that prior to 1973, the local
governments really had authority to control land use. After the passage of the
law, the next day, all of a sudden, they did not have that authority anymore,
and the rights of private landowners were radically reduced. So they went from
a condition of being rather free to develop their land as they pleased to one
where they really had to understand the technical nature of law, as well as
where they were on this map that had the force of law. What zone did they fall
within?</p>
<p>And the argument is
also, the perception of legitimacy, is also curiously tied to science. And
what's the relationship then between science and law? So that if this law was
designed in a way to prevent damage from being incurred by new development,
then how certain are these experts sitting inside the government agency that
the damage is likely to occur? What is the likelihood? Are they thinking about
it formally in terms of probabilities of damages and magnitudes of distribution
of damages? How are they thinking about the need to bring evidence, data, and
strong science to questions about damage that supposedly justify these new
restrictions on their liberty? And what would a population that is low in
income, relatively low in educational attainment compared to other parts of New
York, what's their capacity to challenge these new regulations? I mean, do they
have the ability or the money to hire ecologists or soil scientists or
atmospheric scientists, water quality experts, to challenge the government's
claim that if they build the way they want to that damage is going to occur?</p>
<p>Also, the idea of
compensation, we'll talk more about that, especially next week when we think
about climate change in the coastal zone and what that means for all the
property owners and the trillions of dollars in property value in the coastal
zone. So that under what kinds of conditions do land owners, can they expect
compensation for loss in property value that's associated with these new laws
and regulations?</p>
<p>And I want to also
mention the work of Max Weber. Max Weber was a social scientist in the early
part of the twentieth century, latter part of the nineteenth century, and he
wrote about the idea of authority. And I mentioned on Tuesday, and I want to
reinforce this idea that property is a form of authority. It basically is a
social relationship among those who are given rights and those are obliged to
follow those rights, to not invade those rights. In a way, a right is a kind of
a sphere of liberty. And what happened in the Adirondacks is that this sphere
of liberty was reduced, and it was reduced largely based on the claim of the
government and environmental experts that damage was occurring from new
development and that it should be stopped.</p>
<p>Now, when you think
about the sources of legitimacy and law, if you go back into political and
social theory, you'll find really three dominant sources that are commonly
mentioned. You know, one is the authority of the state to pass law, their
sovereign authority, the state meaning any level of government. Another would
be charisma, the authority that is commanded by a charismatic leader, perhaps a
religious leader. And the third, that I find to be most relevant to this
discussion today, is the idea of tradition. So that the idea that there's been
a traditional pattern of behavior that has been acceptable in a society. We've
always been allowed to sell off five acres a year. Or we've been able to
develop when we wanted to. Now you're telling us that we can't do that. So
possession is often thought of as being nine-tenths of the law, I'm sure you've
heard that phrase. Well, this idea that tradition and custom really underlie
the sense of legitimacy is really quite important. So when people have rights
taken away, they appeal to their customary pattern of behavior and their
traditional rights.</p>
<p>You might also think
about theories in politics about the origin of property. How is property
derived? What's its source? Well, John Locke argued that one source was God.
God gave humans the right to expropriate resources from the land. Another is
labor. And you probably have heard about Locke's labor theory. So that if you
invest your labor in improving land, then you are justified in claiming
ownership to the fruits of that improvement. Another is inheritance. And
Rousseau wrote extensively about the unfairness of inheritance laws and argued
that inheritance, allowing the next generation to take the property from the
previous one, that inheritance really is the fundamental origin of inequality
in society.</p>
<p>Another is scarcity.
So you can imagine yourself being alone on an island, as Robinson Crusoe was.
So that there's really no need for definition of property rights. Basically,
there may have been conditions of scarcity, but there was no need to set up
rules about who could get access to the scarce resources. So that there were
other origins as well, including regulation. I think I'm becoming fascinated by
the relationship between the act of regulation and the creation of new property
rights. So you might think about what we all now are concerned about relative
to climate change as being stalled out because we can't agree on a regulation
to cap the amount of carbon that would be allowed to be emitted into the
atmosphere. So once that cap is established, that's going to set the stage for
the evolution of markets and trading schemes among groups around the world. So
that property rights are often created by regulation in ways that are not
generally perceived.</p>
<p>Another idea is that
when government regulates and creates permits or demands that you come and you
get a license, whether it's a driver's license or a license to use a new
pesticide, whatever it is, if you're required to get a permit, then that permit
automatically has value, and developers will often buy land and then try to get
approval to develop that land with no anticipation that they are going to
actually carry through the development. But they're going to sell that right.
They're going to sell the land along with the permit, so that they will
basically accrue the increase in property value that's associated with a new
permit. And we saw in the atomic weapons testing area, and also related to
private trade secrecy that secrecy creates property rights. So that it creates
great value in the secret and there is often a black market in the trade of
secrets.</p>
<p>So there are a
variety of different kinds of property. You're most familiar with the idea of
private property and public property. But there's also an idea in the
literature about the commons. So that there are these areas of the environment
or the universe that might be thought of as commons, where the property rights
are really not well defined. And Garrett Hardin wrote a piece in 1968 called <em>The
Tragedy of the Commons</em>. If you haven't read it, I commend it to you. And it
was a piece that argued that if you have common land with undefined rights to
it, then people are going to try to take advantage of that land. And he used
the example of a pasture in Great Britain where everybody wanted to graze their
sheep on the pasture. Well, that's fine until you get a critical mass of sheep
on the pasture and all of a sudden you lose the capacity of the landscape to
regenerate the grasses. Eventually, as more and more people come and graze
their sheep, then the resource is going to be degraded and lost. And he was
using that as an argument to justify regulation or a new form of control over
who would have access to the common lands.</p>
<p>We also think about
public lands, I think, in a very simplistic way. And the rest of this lecture
is going to focus on public lands and also the very, very different ways that
rights can be allocated to public lands and the implications of that for
sustainable resource management. And also the fact that as you look out across
the landscape or you think about a nation or any territory, you're going to
have a pretty complex hybrid among these different forms of private property.
And as somebody who might think of themselves as pursuing a career to manage
environmental quality, I'm going to make an argument that you have very little
capacity to manage an environmental problem unless you understand with great
clarity the relationships that are created by these hybrid property systems. So
once you understand the property regime in an area, you have a much higher
capacity to manage it.</p>
<p>And especially next
week, we'll be talking more about the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution,
"Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
compensation." That presented an opportunity for courts through the
twentieth century to the present to debate where the threshold is. What's an
acceptable limit on government authority to take private property? And when do
they cross that threshold and therefore have to compensate the private
landowner for taking away those rights? So what's justifiable public use? This
has been heavily debated in the courts. What government appropriation becomes a
taking? When has land been rendered valueless? And should government's
regulation of private property be restricted?</p>
<p>So let's kind of drop
some of these ideas down onto the Adirondack Park. And I mentioned that it's a
six million acre tract of land. And we could have used a different park or a
different area--we could have used Yellowstone. I'll use a couple of examples
in a few moments about Yellowstone. But in this area, you have six million
acres of land about roughly fifty percent of it is privately owned. And the
other fifty percent is publically owned and was, as I described on Tuesday, the
Adirondack Mountain Reserve. So that it was Forest Preserve land that the
Constitution of New York protects against any sort of timber harvesting, any
sort of structural development unless that development is necessary to protect
that land on the part of the State of New York. And this land has been
classified under the statute that was adopted in 1973, the Adirondack Park
Agency Statute, into a variety of different categories, including wilderness in
the orange at the top, so about eighteen percent of the area, twenty percent of
the area now has been designated as wilderness. Using a standard that is more
rigorous than the federal wilderness designation standard, which requires only
5,000 acres for a new wilderness area to be created, there are nearly twenty
separate wilderness areas in the Adirondacks right now. And the minimum size
requirement to create them is 10,000 acres, so it's double the federal standard
in the total area that's required.</p>
<p>They also have
primitive areas. Primitive areas are like wilderness except that they might
have certain facilities on the interior, perhaps roadways, perhaps fire towers,
perhaps ranger stations, maybe some electric lines. And these primitive areas
constitute a rather small percent. Another area is an experimental area that
I'll show you a slide of in a moment called a canoe area. And then about
twenty-two point four percent of this public land, twenty-two point four
percent of three million acres is classified as wild forest. So just think
about this for a moment. This is the largest tract of intact forest in the
eastern United States. It's extremely rich in biological diversity. And it has
had this century-long, longer than a century, system of control that is
embedded in the Constitution of the State of New York and then further refined
by this Adirondack Park Agency Statute into these different categories that
allowed very different and specific kinds of uses.</p>
<p>Now, think about the
definition of wilderness for just a moment. This is contained in the Wilderness
Act of 1964. "A wilderness in contrast with those areas where man and his
own works dominate the landscape is hereby recognized as an area where the
earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a
visitor who does not remain." Well, this is a very interesting definition.
It implies that the human presence or any human influence in this area is not
tolerable. So that the Adirondacks, again with roughly a million and a quarter
acres of designated wilderness offers many, many opportunities to seek solitude
and get off on your own and test your physical and personal skills. But what's
quite interesting about it is that people within these designated areas are
really drawn to a very small percentage of the area. People are drawn to the
mountain peaks. The one reason why this mountain peak is bald is because people
have hiked to the summit so often and the soils on the summits of peaks
throughout New England are very shallow. So they're very vulnerable. If the
vegetation that this young man is about to jump on, if that vegetation is lost,
the soil that it sits on will be lost, and it will erode down to bedrock, and
thereby, it will never have opportunity to support additional vegetation. Kind
of interesting, I'll show you a clear cut in a western forest in just a moment.</p>
<p>Now I want you to
also think about goals that people have for going into wilderness in different
areas. And I just was looking at the cost of taking a trip and climbing Mt.
Everest in Nepal. And for a single climber, it's $25,000, for two people, it's
40,000, and for seven people it's $70,000. It was kind of interesting that the
governments in different parts of the world are thinking about the right to
climb and the value of the right to climb. At the same time they're thinking
about the costs that the government might incur if something goes wrong on
those trips and they have to fund a rescue effort. By the way, Mt. Everest is
about 29,000 feet in elevation, but Denali in Alaska is about 20,000 feet in
elevation. So if you're willing to give up that last 9,000 feet, you can go to
the top of Denali for only $200. By the way, there are also many parts of the
world where climbing parties are required to post a bond, a bond that would
cover the total cost of an expedition to go in and rescue them in the case that
something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Now in the
Adirondacks, another way to think about wilderness, or my view of wilderness
was shifted dramatically. And just as an aside, when I was working in the
Adirondack Park when I was younger, my responsibility was to manage the policy
for these wilderness lands. So that I faced constant tension and argument and
debate about what user group should be allowed access into which areas. And if
a new wilderness area was being designated, people would fight to keep the
roads open, to keep the ranger cabins open, to basically maintain these
traditional or customary patterns of use.</p>
<p>So one thing that I
was struck by was this tower that sits on the top of Whiteface Mountain. White
Face is the site of the Olympic training downhill facilities. And it's also a
national weather station that started to collect data during the 1970s and early
1980s that demonstrated that we were experiencing significant changes in the
atmosphere. We were experiencing increases in sulfur and sulfur dioxide,
nitrogen oxides that were producing sulfuric and nitric acids. And these acids
were having an effect on a forest in the Adirondacks and shifting the
biological diversity, particularly at high elevations, in ways that really were
not anticipated.</p>
<p>Why high elevations
and not low elevations? Well, it turns out that nobody had really thought about
the contribution of fog and clouds that cluster around mountain peaks as
creating kind of an intense and chronic exposure to the plants or animals that
live in those areas. So that the red spruce decline in the Adirondacks is now
related to this. The red spruce become susceptible to a variety of different
kinds of insects in response to their exposure to increased acidity.</p>
<p>A paradox of
wilderness and thinking about how to manage it is that we tend to think about
it as nature and the wild, but it really is a social construction, and there's
a very strong association with liberty. And the paradox is that if you're
managing a wilderness area, then you have to think carefully about what
intensity of human use it could sustain and still maintain its character. And
many people, and I am included, think that when I go into a wild area, I'm not
really interested in signing up at a ranger station and getting a permit go
into a wilderness and being told where I can camp and where I can't camp. That
kind of defeats the purpose, in my mind, of what wildness is.</p>
<p>So what's the origin
of that worry? Well, it's basically the association of wildness with personal
freedom. But obviously, as more and more people want to climb Denali or Mt.
Everest or go in to the high peaks of the Adirondacks, it raises the question
of carrying capacity. What's an appropriate limit? So the Adirondack Park
Agency faced this question with respect to many different ecosystems that it
had the responsibility under this law to manage. There are some 2,000 different
islands on more than 1,000 lakes and ponds in the Adirondacks. And these tend
to be pretty small, a couple acres in size. They also tend to be basically just
granitic bedrock that has very shallow soils so that new development on these
islands was quite highly restricted. And islands are extremely desirable from a
developer's prospective, and also from the perspective of recreationists. So
that if you were canoeing down this lake in the Adirondacks and you saw one of
these islands, you probably would want to canoe over to one and explore it or
camp on it. And the state has built campsites on these islands.</p>
<p>So there are always
questions about how much development and what kind can it sustain. How much
recreational intensity can it sustain without damage? In this case, one of the
key questions would be sewage disposal, as I was mentioning with the Camp
Sagamore slide back on Tuesday. So the FOOT [Freshmen Outdoor Orientation
Trips] group here, when I was working with FOOT as an advisor some years ago,
the FOOT crew went up to Adirondacks and I helped them lay out trails through
the Adirondacks that seemed like they were suitable. But it was quite curious,
because the park became much more concerned about loss of soil on the peaks and
the routes and they decided that one approach was going to be to limit the size
of the parties. I can't remember the size. Some of you probably went on FOOT,
anybody in the room? What's the party size on FOOT?</p>
<p><strong>Student: </strong>Each group?</p>
<p><strong>Professor John Wargo:
</strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Student: </strong>About ten.</p>
<p><strong>Professor John Wargo:
</strong>About
ten. Well, this party size has been now restricted to eight in the Adirondacks,
which basically meant if FOOT was going to keep using the area that it would
have to reduce its party size. So that there were kind of interesting questions
about cost efficiency and the program effectiveness related to party size and
many logistical questions, so that they decided to back out and to move to
other sites. So this idea that for any wilderness area, you would have both a
kind of physical, biological idea of what its carrying capacity might be.</p>
<p>But there is also
very interesting literature on the psychology of wilderness that has been
pioneered by the Forest Service about what people expect. What do people want?
Do they want to see people when they go back into remote areas? And most people
would presume that the answer would be no. But then if you look at the pattern
of wilderness use and national park use in our country and pretty much around
the world, what you see is that wilderness is a playground for social cohesion
in a way. I mean, families go back, friends go back into remote areas. So that
very few people go into very remote areas alone. I find that to be kind of
interesting. So that it becomes an outdoor opportunity for socialization.</p>
<p>Another kind of right
that you might not think about is this right to use motor vehicles and the
right of access. And if you allow float plane operators in the national park or
a wilderness area, you are creating a variety of management headaches. Now,
float planes are not allowed in wilderness areas. And when we decided we were
going to close off a large number of lakes to motor vehicle access, either by
car or use of boats or jet skis or access by aircraft, you can imagine the
howls that went up. Because people had gone on to the public land as they have
in many remote parts of the U.S. including in large areas of Alaska. And they
have built these camps on public land. And they claim that they've been using
this camp for the past couple of decades, that their daddy used that camp and
that they really have a right to continue access and continue use.</p>
<p>Well, the strength of
the conflict is really driven by what options they've got. And luckily in the
Adirondacks, remember you've got this wilderness category but you've got these
other categories as well, where motor vehicles are allowed. And they would have
similar opportunities to fly into other lakes. So that the politics was managed
basically because of the existence of alternative sites. Still, those people
that had gone back to their camps and invested in building camps, and some of
these camps were actually quite nice. They had stoves, they had propane gas
stoves, they had heaters, they had refrigerators. So that these were more than
modest little campsites.</p>
<p>The evolution of
small, motorized vehicles has also created a very significant management
headache. So that whether or not it's a jet ski or an ATV, the Forest Service,
the Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Nature Conservancy, anybody
who manages a large tract of land in the United States today is faced with
worrying and trying to figure out how to manage access by these vehicles.
They're fast, they're light, they can basically zip around and escape rangers.
So that the amount of damage these can cause is really quite interesting. And
many of the users are also interested in hunting. And the ATVs provide
basically a vehicular method to pull game out of remote areas. This shot of
snowmobiles in west Yellowstone is also interesting to me. West Yellowstone,
during the wintertime in periods of peak usage by snowmobiles, where they have
conventions of thousands of snowmobiles in west Yellowstone, the particulate
and ozone air quality is often worse than it is in New York City or it is in Los
Angeles. So that there has been an improvement in the emissions from these
smaller engines. But still, they are significantly less efficient than our
motor vehicle engines, such as cars.</p>
<p>I also wanted to
mention that the Adirondacks has a bunch of scientific experiments. And one of
the values of wilderness is to provide an environment where scientific
experiments can take place. And the idea that the ecology and the chemistry of
Adirondack ecosystems is being transformed by our coal burning behavior in the
Midwestern part of the United States, so that the emissions from the Midwest
sweep up the Ohio Valley, they sweep into Pennsylvania and New York State, and
that's really one of the predominate sources of the acid aerosols here. And now
these lakes are basically barren of native strains of trout. And it's primarily
because they're highly dependent upon an acidity level not getting above, or
the pH not getting below a certain level.</p>
<p>In this case, a
variety of different experiments have been attempted, including liming the
lakes. When I was there, we would fix buckets, these really large buckets of
lime. And helicopters would pick up the buckets and drop the lime over the
lakes in an attempt to buffer the acidity and make it more suitable for the
native strains of trout. Eventually, this became so cumbersome and they
realized it would cost way too much to apply this broadly across different
lakes and ponds. That instead, they thought about genetic modification of fish
to increase their tolerance. So that there are now a variety of different
species of trout that have been genetically engineered to make them more
tolerant. So that when I mentioned earlier that my perception of what
wilderness is was transformed by the atmospheric testing that took place on the
top of White Face Mountain, this is what I meant.</p>
<p>Also, if you go back
to some of the old growth timber in the park, timber that's been there for at
least say fifty or sixty years, and if you did a core, so in other words if you
took a screw and you cored into the tree and you pulled out a core of wood all
the way from the center of the tree, you could test back in time and have a
chemical replication of what was in the air during different years. So one of
the interesting things that you could find is the period between 1945 and 1963,
which was the atomic weapons testing era, you would find the radionuclides in
some species of timber that are of that age up there. So that in some way, they
become a chronicle of past atmospheric quality.</p>
<p>The Olympic training
facility in the Adirondacks also presented many different kinds of property
rights questions. This is the downhill ski facility, on top of which is the
weather station. And this has long been the site of national and international
ski racing competitions. And there was a very curious debate about this,
because this is on Adirondack Forest Preserve land, and this facility was not
allowed to be built until the Legislature passed on two successive occasions an
amendment to the New York State Constitution. It's quite interesting. So that
no development, remember, could be built on Forest Preserve Lands unless there
was a Constitutional amendment that required those two successive actions on
the part of the Legislature. So they did this, but they also constrained the
trail width to eighty feet.</p>
<p>Well, the
International Olympic Committee said, "We can't have a downhill ski race
on a trail that's only eighty feet in width. Our racers are likely to go speeds
of eighty, ninety, a hundred miles an hour in the steepest areas. We've got to
do something about that. We want to cut swaths in the landscape that
are--" In one case, they wanted to cut one that was about a hundred yards
in width in the argument of safety. Well, the eventual solution was "No,
you can't cut the trails up to that level, because that would be a violation of
the Constitution. But instead, you can install netting on the sides of the
trails so that if the skiers go out of control, they'll become entangled in the
nets and they won't hit the trees." Kind of a very interesting debate
between the environmentalists on the one hand and those that are promoting the
value of the Olympics and the international camaraderie and good spirits that
it generates and those concerned about the health and safety of the ski racers.</p>
<p>Another facility that
I had the opportunity to manage the permit issuance for was the ski jump
facility. I don't know, are any of you ski jumpers? Probably not here. But when
I taught at Dartmouth, I had a number of ski jumpers in my classes. And these
facilities are-- it's a ninety-meter ski jump, meaning that if you take off
from the end, the maximum flight distance, safe flight distance, is roughly
ninety meters. And then the seventy-meter jump is next to it. And these were
highly contested because they are the tallest structures now between Albany,
New York, and Montreal. And they lie immediately adjacent to the High Peaks
Wilderness Area.</p>
<p>So the question posed
to the Park Agency was: What kind of effect would these towers have on the wilderness
character of the High Peaks region? And the Olympic organizing committee loved
the idea. They thought that these towers would become symbolic of Lake Placid
and the Adirondacks being a winter sports capital and training site for the
nation. But the environmentalists threatened to sue. They argued that this
should not be allowed, that it is a clear intrusion into the wilderness
character of the area. Eventually, the State of New York decided that these
towers should be built, rather obviously, and that despite the requirement of
the National Environmental Policy Act that demands that whenever federal funds
are being expended that alternative sites have to be explored.</p>
<p>So that in this case
that meant, well, could you find an alternative site where you didn't have to
build a 350-foot tower? And the answer was yes. Several alternatives existed
that would even be lower in cost. And here's an example from Europe of how many
European communities such as Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Innsbruck and the jumps
in Sweden and Norway, they're built into the hillside. So basically the problem
is, it's an engineering problem of sorts. You know that you have a very
specific profile that is necessary in the jump design and you also have a
specific profile in the landing hill that is required. It has to be precise,
otherwise the jumpers are in danger. Also, they need to point north. Because if
the sun comes down and beats on the track, it can change the consistency of the
snow on the in run and make it unfair for say a jumper that's going later in
the day. They also have to point in a direction that is opposite of prevailing
winds, because when a jumper goes off the jump, you don't want them blowing
around. So that they have very specific site design criteria. However, when one
was found in Lake Placid, the National Environmental Policy Act demanded that
that site be considered. And it was eventually rejected by the State of New
York, which resulted in the building of that tower.</p>
<p>Now one additional
example of an intrusion into wilderness that was being proposed was the Mt. Van
Hoevenberg cross-country ski run. And this is now a terrific run. And they have
fifty kilometer races that are held in the Olympics. And when this was
proposed, people thought, well these trails really don't need to be anything
perhaps wider than this table on the top of the podium here. And it turned out
that they had to be quite a bit wider. They needed motorized vehicles that
could move through and they could plough the snow up the way that a snowcat
would at a ski area and that set a track behind them for the racers to follow.
So the question became well, should we allow motorized access in wilderness
areas to facilitate the development of this facility? And the answer was no.
The government, the State of New York decided that instead, there was an
adjacent tract of land that could easily be used and they would even have to
use less land area and cut down fewer trees if they would use bridges the way
that many of the European communities that have these facilities have done that
cross the trails so that a wooden bridge crosses the trail so that you don't
have interference as the race progresses.</p>
<p>Wilderness often
creates additional debates about the kind of interior management that should
occur. Should you have facilities on the interior such as a ranger station?
Should a ranger live on the interior? Or should the rangers be roving through
the area? Very interesting questions related to emergency response time. And
the access by helicopter obviously reduces that response time. And the advent
of wireless communications makes it much easier to get injured people out of
these areas. But every year, several people will die in the Adirondacks in the
middle of the winter. It's famous for its storms where they start out at say
thirty-seven degrees and it's raining. And then by maybe eight or ten hours
later, the temperature drops to ten below zero. So people first get frozen--
they first get cold and then they become hypothermic. So that response time is
really an important issue. Within the Adirondacks, they decided to remove the
ranger cabins from the interior, and instead hire more rangers that would have
more requirements for patrolling the interior area. Kind of an interesting
tradeoff between response time and the wilderness character of the area.</p>
<p>Also really
interesting debates about how to manage fire in wild lands. And these vary
agency to agency. So the Forest Service has a very different policy toward
managing fires than the National Park Service has had. And this was very
apparent in the enormous Yellowstone National Park fires that burned tens of
thousands of acres. So imagine the National Park Service lying next to U.S.
Forest Service land, and the Park Service has a no-burn policy. Let nature take
its course, lightning strikes, the fire starts, and we're not going to suppress
it. So what that meant to the Forest Service was that their timber leases were
quite vulnerable and the timber companies were claiming they had private
property rights to those timber and the government had an obligation to ensure
that it fought forest fires to the best of their ability to protect their
rights. So very interesting conflicts over attitudes about how to manage
wilderness, how to manage nature in its wilder form. And once you permit a
commodity such as a timber right or a hunting right or a mineral extraction
right, then in a way, government becomes obligated to ensure continued access
to the corporation to get those rights out of the public domain.</p>
<p>I'd like you to think
about a couple of other ideas about property rights. And we're almost running
out of time, and I'm going to give you just this one example here of
development in the coastal zone. This is a tract of land that lies between Los
Angeles and San Diego on the Pacific. And here you see basically a planned unit
development area where you have gated communities in the hills overlooking the
Pacific, and they basically ran out of land. So you can imagine if you've got a
town and you lay a grid over it that is one-acre zoning in the entire town,
eventually, you're going to have one house on every one of those acres. And
that is then thought of as the concept of build out, a town is at its build
out.</p>
<p>So if that is the
case, then what are you going to do? I mean, I suppose you could allow people,
through a variance to a zoning ordinance, to build up, to build higher
structures. But in this case, they granted the developer the right to build a
marina. Now, a marina, what's a marina? Well this is some marina. This marina
has hundreds and hundreds of berths. And these boats are not minor boats. And
you can think about this one community and think about the process. The
developer goes to the State of California because the California Coastal
Commission has jurisdiction. It goes to the town of Dana Point. It eventually
has to go to the Coast Guard and to a variety of other federal agencies to get
permits to develop this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But once they do
that, it creates an enormously profitable business. Not only do these people
have to pay slip fees, but they have to pay fees for having their sewage pumped
out of their boats. The town put up recreational opportunities that the users
will pay for. And the tax revenues to the community are in the millions of
dollars per year because the community is able to tax the value of the boat.
Some of these boats are forty, fifty, seventy feet in length. So that the
average estimate of real estate value, the boats are always changing depending
upon who buys a lease to the berths. But about $250,000,000 in increased real
estate value was created out of what was formerly public land, common land
owned and managed by the State of California.</p>
<p>So I'm going to leave
you just with a thought that managing land is all about managing property
rights and conflicts over access to scarce and valuable resources. And the
Adirondacks provides I think one pretty interesting example of that because of
the complexity of land classifications that were created. I tend to think of
the Adirondacks as having dramatically shifted my perception of the potential
for us on earth any longer to experience wildness. My idea of wildness is not
what it was when I worked there. I had no understanding of the chemical
dimension of the Adirondacks and how humans have changed the chemistry of the
park.</p>
<p>That also raises a
very interesting question about climate change. So that Melinda Smith, a
professor in ecology and evolutionary biology, gave a very interesting lecture
yesterday about the influence of increasing temperature and changes in moisture
on the future of grasslands. And she argued that well, three percent of the
world's grasslands are now in protected area status, only three percent.
However, changes in the humidity, changes in the temperature are causing
reductions in productivity and changes in biological diversity that were never
imagined when these legal regimes, such as the Adirondack Park Agency, were
created. Now in the Adirondacks, you've got also changes in temperature and
you've got changes in biological diversity. And what that means is that the
approach to managing these property rights has been insufficient to manage the
ecological change that it's now experiencing. So it's dramatically shifting my
perception of what the future of a park and protected area should be as
ecological systems and habitats are literally migrating through these different
parks and protected areas.</p>
<p>So what this means
really is that to tackle, if we had the objective of managing biological
diversity in parks that we really need to think more closely about its link to
climate change. So that a regulatory regime that manages climate is really
essentially for long-term effective management of biological diversity. So,
that's it for today. Have a great weekend.</p>
