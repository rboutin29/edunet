<p><strong>Professor John Wargo:
</strong>Today, I want to
continue talking about energy futures and alternative choices that we have to
face. And I think about this as a problem of being on the horns of a
quad-lemma. And after I put this slide together, I was on my way to lecture
this morning, I was saying to myself it's not really a quad-lemma, the analogy
being a dilemma. It really has many more dimensions to it. But the way that it's
being characterized to the public by politicians and those that are concerned
about energy futures is predominately a choice between renewables and existing
production capacity with respect to fossil fuels, particularly coal, and also
our nuclear future that we discussed last week. But the topic that really does
not make it onto the agenda, which is one that I think is crucial, is energy
efficiency and what we could achieve by altering our patterns of consumption.
And I think as well, our capacity to read the energy demands of our own daily
behaviors in the marketplace and in our daily lives make it extremely difficult
to do that.</p>
<p>So that today, I want
to concentrate predominately on the problem of renewables, but also
specifically talk about wind energy. So the National Academy of Sciences
prepared a publication that you read, hopefully, up on the Classes server for
this week, on the potential of renewables, particularly wind and solar. And
solar and wind, they concluded, renewable resources offer significantly larger
total energy potential than do other domestic renewable resources. Solar
intensity obviously varies across the nation. The land-based solar resource
exceeds by several thousand-fold present annual U.S. electrical energy demand.
So wind is capable is providing at least ten percent to twenty percent, and in
some regions of the country, potentially higher percentages of current
electrical energy demand.</p>
<p>Think about installed
capacity. In the world, Germany is clearly the leader in terms of megawatt
production, but also percentage of their total electrical energy demands at
about twenty-three, twenty-four percent. The U.S. follows in second at about
eighteen percent, then Spain, India, China, Denmark. But this ranking is
shifting quite rapidly, particularly in China and India and other rapidly
developing parts of the world.</p>
<p>Well, there was a
statute that was passed back in 2005 that has really provided a lot of
incentive, economic incentive to the private sector and to government agencies
as well to think about new forms of providing energy, particularly from
renewable resources. So income from activity may be excluded from gross income
and not taxed if it's expended on renewable energy facilities. Income may be
taxed at a lower rate. The expense from the activity may be deducted more
quickly. And those of you that filed your income taxes last week probably do
not itemize your deductions. But deductions are set up in ways that you may
depreciate property over different lengths of time. You may be able to
depreciate a car, for example, over eight or ten years or a truck over that
period of time, a house is thirty-two years, and other kinds of products that
you might buy. You could depreciate those fully in the first year, meaning that
you can get a total deduction on its value during the year that you purchased
it.</p>
<p>So that these
expenses may be eligible for tax credits as well. A deduction is different than
a tax credit. A deduction is an itemization that you would use to reduce your
total estimated or adjusted gross income, whereas a tax credit would be a
reduction in your taxes at the end of your return. Most people would favor
taking a tax credit, it would be more to their advantage.</p>
<p>So that these
production tax credits that came into being in 2005 really have been quite
successful, as is demonstrated. There were previous production credits back in
1999 and 2001 and 2003. And then they expired at the end of those years. So
that if you can see this chart, you can see the rather dramatic decline in the
populations taking advantage of these credits. There is a business solar tax
credit that offers a thirty percent tax credit for the purchase of equipment
that produces solar electricity. Business fuel cell credits are available that
are produced even using chemicals that are created by fossil fuels. There's a
residential efficient property credit, which is a personal tax credit for
eligible technology, such as water heaters, furnaces, boilers, heat pumps,
central air conditioners, building insulation, windows, doors, and roofs. In my
income taxes this year, I installed a new energy efficient water heater that I
was able to take a tax credit of thirty percent of $2000, which is a
substantial savings.</p>
<p>Also, many states are
acting on their own. And a topic that we've discussed repeatedly in the course
is if you're thinking about trying to change behavior, what level of government
is the appropriate government to establish law or policy? And the federal
government has been clearly behind the eight ball. They've been delinquent or
neglectful of passing renewable energy standards and creating incentives in a
way that really had a strong influence on renewable energy production relative
to particularly fossil fuel production. So states have jumped into this problem
by creating their own renewable energy portfolio standards. So for example,
Massachusetts has a standard that is targeting fifteen percent renewable of
their total energy demand by 2020. Ohio is twenty-five percent by 2025, New
Mexico is twenty percent by 2020. California is 20 percent by 2010, and
Washington is fifteen percent by 2020. So that these are legally binding
standards and the states are required to figure out how to reduce their
reliance on fossil fuels while increasing their reliance on renewable sources.</p>
<p>So if you look at the
problem of wind and you think about its distribution in the nation, Texas,
perhaps not surprisingly, has the largest current installed capacity, almost
9,000 megawatts, followed by Iowa, California, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington,
New York, Colorado, Illinois, and then Kansas. You can also see the effect in
this graph of the recession on installation of wind-provided electricity. So
2008 was far higher in new installations than 2009, so that this industry also
is subject to the same kinds of limitations as any other sector.</p>
<p>The cost of wind and
transmission that is economically available might be broken into two different
categories, onshore and offshore. It's quite obviously more expensive to
develop further offshore. And the less expensive areas are those that are
closest to the coastline. And what we see, we'll see a case in a few moments
known as Cape Wind that is being proposed for Nantucket Sound. And the
advantage obviously is that this is in federal territory so that no private
property needs to be purchased, so that the quantity available offshore is
believed to be just about the same as onshore. But the difficulty of getting a
wind project off the ground on private property, as we'll see in a few moments,
compared to offshore is really quite significant.</p>
<p>So many people are
now arguing for a twenty percent target by 2030 as a goal for wind-based
energy. If we choose this as a target, how do we get there? And what would be
the influence on our use of alternative sources of energy? So if we have no new
wind, you can see in this chart then our reliance on natural gas, coal,
nuclear, hydro, and current wind would look something like this, with wind in
the green. But a twenty percent wind scenario would predominately cause us to
reduce our reliance on coal, but also some of our reliance on natural gas and
nuclear. And why nuclear? Well, because many of the reactors are going to be
approaching the end of their license periods. And many of them, as we discussed
last week, are beyond their thirty to forty-year licensing period. So we're
going to be phasing out nuclear, and depending upon the incentives for
investment in new nuclear plants, the future growth is going to be impeded, not
just by the extraordinary capital costs and the incremental cost of securing
loans for nuclear, given its uncertainty. But also, the problems of simply the
amount of time it takes to build a nuclear plant.</p>
<p>If we rely more
heavily on wind, we need to think about how to get transmission facilities,
transmission lines, in close proximity to the key sources of wind. So that
obviously, as you look at the United States, you find wind capacity varies
geographically. The coastal areas, Washington, Oregon, California, the East
Coast and the Gulf Coast are the predominant sites for offshore development.
And the Midwestern United States is the predominant location for development in
non-coastal areas. And this creates a problem, particularly for the Midwest,
because the Midwest is not a population center in the nation. So that
transmissions needed to relieve congestion in the existing system to improve
system reliability for all customers, to increase access to lower-cost energy,
but also to access new and remote generation resources. So that if the twenty percent
scenario by 2030 is followed, this is going to have a very significant effect
on Co2 emissions from the electricity sector. So that this is thought of as a
really important type of investment.</p>
<p>Now siting often
creates an enormously complex set of rules and regulations that have to be
followed in order to gain permits from the federal government, state
governments, and local governments. The predominant concerns about development
include visual impacts, property value impacts, effects on local wildlife and
habitat, turbine or rotor noise and land use, potential effects on adjacent
land uses. So wind generation is, for example, responsible for about 0.003
percent of human-caused avian mortality, particularly among passerines and
bats. And bat mortality has been found to be higher than expected, but only in
certain areas of the world, in certain high elevation zones, mountain peaks,
and also mountain passes. So that these are the predominant concerns that cause
litigation.</p>
<p>People are also
worried about the amount of area that it's going to take in order to reach this
objective of twenty percent by 2030. And the actual footprint that has been
measured and is being used by the proponents of wind energy is really quite
small. So total acreage of about fifteen million acres, roughly about the size
of Rhode Island or Anchorage. So that the deceptive aspect of that statistic is
that the conflict that surrounds this is not generated by the site development
and the amount of area, the land area or the ocean area that has to be
disturbed in order to put the facilities in, it's generated by its visibility,
predominantly by people's impressions that I find to be really quite curious. I
was driving to work this morning and admiring the wind turbine that was just
put up over here next to the Q-Bridge, and was thinking about that and thinking
about people's acceptance or preferences to view landscapes without towers
generally. And as I kind of surveyed the landscape quickly, I was looking at
the old coal-fired power plant next to the Q-Bridge, then I was looking at the
transmission lines that lie next to it. I was looking at the bridge itself.
Really an industrialized landscape.</p>
<p>Probably not a good
thing to say to people here for Yale Bulldog Days. There are very beautiful
parts of New Haven and the university is a central source of New Haven's
beauty. But that part of New Haven is not, it's one of the most industrialized
zones in Connecticut. But there stands this new wind turbine, gleaming white.
And actually, it's dwarfed by other stacks, smokestacks and the transmission
lines nearby. But people have problems with towers generally, and I was
wondering about that.</p>
<p>And I've worked on
tower siting problems in the past. And I used the example when we had the
lecture on land preservation of the controversy over the Olympic Games in
northern New York where the ninety- and seventy-meter ski jump were proposed
that almost brought the Olympic Games to a halt because of threatened
litigation by the Sierra Club. And the aversion there was the loss of the sense
of a natural landscape. And this is very much a prominent part of the argument
on the part of landowners in the coastal area that looks out over Nantucket
Sound. They're worried about the view. They're worried about the visibility.
Somehow, they think it's going to diminish the sense of naturalness of that
landscape, and that's provoked their litigation.</p>
<p>So that there are
other kinds of towers that we seem to accept, but it may be a function of
whether or not we can get up into the tower to take a look. Many people up in
Lake Placid eventually accepted a 300-foot tower as a ski jump that was
immediately adjacent to a wilderness area. But part of the fascination was
well, this is for sport, but it also is going to give the opportunity to create
an observation deck that people could go up to. I was thinking about other
towers that we seem to readily accept in more urbanized environments,
residential towers, office buildings, or even the Eiffel Tower. So that what is
it about towers and our sense of naturalness that provokes this kind of
reaction? I've also worked on communication towers and electrical transmission
lines that demand high towers. And these are commonly fought with great energy
just as people are fighting the wind turbines. So that that would be the
subject of a great senior essay, by the way, if anybody is looking around for
one next year.</p>
<p>Think about also the
nature of property rights to wind and to solar radiation. So does the
developer, for example, have the right to block access to a resource such as
wind or solar radiation or water, if you live upstream and you decide you want
to put a dam in the river? Or sand, remember the shifting sands on barrier
islands, and remember, if you fly out of New Haven over the coastline and you
see these groins that are set up to trap sand as it moves along the coastline.
And that causes a sand deficit downstream so that the person that lives next to
you has to build a groin so he can catch sand to prevent his shoreline from
eroding. The same basic principle here. So that if I build a structure, perhaps
a high rise building that blocks your access to wind or even if I build a high
rise building and it blocks your access to solar radiation, do you have the
right to take me to court and either to prevent the development or do I have
the right to demand that you compensate me for my property loss in value? Well
common law, law passed by courts, is really unclear on the matter unless
there's clear and malicious intent. So unlike underground minerals, no one can
extract wind or solar radiation from your property without your consent.</p>
<p>Now, I want you to
think back about the lecture several weeks ago when I considered the Horse
Whisperer out in Wyoming and the extraordinarily rapid development of coal bed
methane gas being extracted because the federal government sold off the
underlying property rights to private corporations who then basically had the
right to transfer their production equipment to build towers on people's
ranches, on their private lands. So the story was the Horse Whisperer woke up
to construction crews bulldozing roads over their property. And outraged,
thought that he had the right to call the police and stop the development, when
he didn't, because those gas extraction companies had purchased the rights
legitimately from the government. Well, in this case are the wind or solar
radiation rights similarly owned as common property by the federal government?
And the answer is no. So that you would have the opportunity to prevent
somebody from coming onto your land and building a wind turbine. But kind of an
interesting comparison here, the way that law is structured to allocate common
property rights to the private sector for energy development.</p>
<p>So think about wind
capacity and the desirability of different areas of the country, and also think
about the nature of private development in the coastal zone. And I remember the
California oil spills and how the tar and the oil would wash up on the beaches.
And it was kind of interesting, you'd go for a run on the beach and you get
back to your house or wherever you were staying and your feet are covered by
tar. Even today in some parts of California, they're covered by tar from the
Santa Barbara oil spills back in the 1970s. So that these tend to be highly
developable properties, highly valued property. And if they are the site of
residential structures, you're guaranteed to have a fight for any significant
offshore development. So there's an interesting kind of coincidence here of high-end
property, people that are likely to have values that are instinctively to
protect the coastal zone as well as to protect the naturalness of the views
from their private property. So that this conflict is the source of litigation
and also legislation.</p>
<p>Here are the top ten
states for wind energy potential. The last slide I showed you was top ten
states for current generating capacity. So Texas, Kansas, Montana and Nebraska,
Midwestern states and Texas particularly in the coastal as well, South Dakota,
North Dakota, Iowa, Wyoming, Oklahoma, New Mexico. So very interesting that
these have the highest capacity, but they tend not to be close to where the
majority of people in the U.S. live. I'm going to jump ahead here.</p>
<p>So here is the
scenario, offshore development versus land-based development. The projections
are that the majority of new capacity will come from onshore or land-based
development that creates all the political conflict because of questions about
how to manage private property rights. So that if you look at the quantity
available offshore and onshore and you look at the relative wind speed in these
areas, you see that the land-based is going to likely generate more gigawatts
than the offshore.</p>
<p>So what are the key
benefits here? Well, benefits to the environment, benefits in terms of reduced
air pollution from fossil fuels, and there's no question about the fact that
we'll be facing increased coal generation, coal power generation, that is going
to give us problems with particulate matter, sulfur and nitrogen oxides. And
remember that statistic that I told you last week, that this is a really
important statistic, particularly relative to the health effects of coal.
Between 30,000 and 60,000 people are estimated in a variety of peer-reviewed and
I think highly defensible studies, they suffer premature death in the United
States every year due to coal production. So that you compare that to nuclear,
you compare that to mortality estimates from wind or solar development, and
there really is no contest. In terms of climate, the reduced CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions are estimated to be about 825 million metric tons per year if the
twenty percent of our electricity is produced by 2030. Reduced water, reduced
coal use, reduced cost per kilowatt hour, and also the increased tax revenues
that'll be generated to local communities. So if you build a wind turbine on
your property, you're going to have to pay the local government property taxes
on your revenue. And also you're going to be paying the federal government taxes
on the revenue. So the future of wind, as I mentioned earlier, is likely to
have the greatest influence on our reliance on coal, but could also affect our
reliance on nuclear.</p>
<p>There's a lot of
concern among environmentalists over avian mortality. So it's important to
think about the different causes of avian mortality, and it's quite striking
that mortality from buildings and windows, and these are avian deaths, so that
you see that the majority are being caused by birds flying into buildings and
windows, followed by housecats, high transmission lines, vehicles, pesticides.
Actually, the pesticide estimate is low. I worked on a panel that addressed the
question about several of the largest, most produced insecticides in the world,
and they are responsible for very significant avian losses. Communication
towers and wind turbines, if they reach this twenty percent by 2030, are
projected to be really quite low. Now, that doesn't mean that we don't pay
attention to them, and legally we have an obligation to do so. And that's
because of the Endangered Species Act. And this will come to play when we talk
in a few minutes about the Nantucket Sound case that might influence the piping
plover that nests in the adjacent shorelines.</p>
<p>Also, there are
concerns about noise, how noisy are they compared to other sources of noise? So
if you look at jet aircraft at 250 meters, you look a pneumatic drill, you look
at a truck, an office, a car at forty meters, then you find a wind-power plant
at 350 meters would be about equivalent to a quiet bedroom or perhaps a car
operating at forty miles an hour that drives by a hundred meters away. So the
implications of this are kind of interesting in terms of managing noise. How
might you do that? Well, you could think about using zoning. You could demand
very large lot zoning. And remember the case in the Adirondacks where one new
house for perhaps forty percent of the private land in the Adirondacks, forty
percent of two and a half million acres. So one new house requires forty-three
acres up in the Adirondacks. So what would it take you to get a buffer between
the turbine location on land and a separation distance that would reduce the
decibel level on adjacent properties? Well, you could imagine designing a
zoning ordinance that would allow you to control noise on adjacent lands in
that fashion.</p>
<p>Well, it's important
for you to think too about the structure of the U.S. utility industry. There
are about two hundred investor-owned utilities in the nation, seventy large
municipal and federal or state systems, fifty rural generation and transmission
cooperatives, and three thousand local distribution companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think also about who
are the dominant consumers of energy in the United States. Turns out that the
federal government is the largest single consumer of electricity in the world.
The federal agency electricity consumption in 2005 was more than 55,000
gigawatt hours, which would equate to approximately eighteen gigawatts of wind
capacity. So federal agencies were encouraged to meet an executive order goal
of two point five percent of site electricity from new renewable energy sources
by the end of 2005.</p>
<p>By the way, we've not
talked about executive orders in the class, but I'm going to pause here just to
point out that law may be established at very different levels of government,
state, local, federal. But also it may be established by regulation, so EPA has
the legal authority to establish regulations. And the Executive Branch of the
government, the office of the President, has the legal authority to establish
executive orders that must be complied with within the federal government by
federal agencies. So that in this case, to meet the ordered goal of two point
five percent, this goal was actually exceeded with a final tally of about six point
nine percent of electricity consumed was derived from renewable sources.</p>
<p>So that's kind of an
interesting idea. So figure out who are the largest consumers and then set
goals for them and then challenge them, set up a competition. And we've seen
that competitive spirit work here in the college as well. So that colleges are
trying to not just reduce their waste and to increase their rate of recycling,
but they're also trying to reduce their energy consumption. So that now the
federal agencies are all challenged to try to figure out how they can increase
their renewable component of their energy consumption portfolios. There's also
the concept of renewable energy credits and renewable energy certificates. And
these are tradable non-tangible energy commodities in the U.S. that represent
proof that one megawatt hour of electricity was generated from an eligible
renewable energy resource, which would include solar, wind, geothermal, hydro,
biomass or energy derived from hydrogen fuel cells.</p>
<p>Now, I want to talk
for a few moments about the problem up in Nantucket Sound. And this is a
project, Cape Wind, that was initiated in 2001 when this company decided that
they wanted to put up about 130 turbines in Nantucket Sound. And the state of
Rhode Island, by the way, has taken a very different path, not just reacting to
a developer's proposal, but Rhode Island has taken the initiative to zone parts
of its offshore territory. And they have designated a company, a developer, as
a preferred developer, and have now proposed about a $1.5 billion farm in
eastern Rhode Island. So states could basically be reactive in their approach
to developing wind energy. Just wait for the developers to show up. But Rhode
Island is taking a very different approach to this, so that they are in a way
acting as the developer themselves.</p>
<p>So if you take a look
at this wind map of the southern New England coastline, you see that there are
areas, particularly off of Rhode Island and particularly here in Nantucket
Sound, which are really quite suitable in terms of the amount of wind energy
that is available for development. So the Cape Wind proposal would involve, as
I said, 130 different turbines. On average, it would provide about seventy-five
percent of the entire electrical requirements for the Cape and the islands. So
I don't know if this is going to work. But let me see if I can show you a
YouTube video here, just briefly. Here is a scene that shows a boat of
sightseers just moving through a wind farm off the coast of Denmark, just to
give you a sense of what it would be like.</p>
<p>Now, there are
questions here about navigation. There are questions about interference with
others' property rights. So offshore waters, if you're beyond the three-mile
jurisdictional limit then it becomes federal lands. If you're between the mean
high water mark and the three-mile zone, that is state land. And what this
means is because these power lines will have to lie beneath the surface as they
run from the turbines back to the mainland, that they clearly will cross from
federal lands into state lands. And then they will cross private lands. Or in
some instances, they will require dredging of wetland areas up onto local
government property. So that local, state, federal, and private property rights
are all at play in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So that there are
also issues that arise from conflicts with fishermen who may have the right to
lobster in this area. Perhaps they use a form of fishing that drags over the
bottom. These are known as the Nantucket Shoals, known to be former clamming
areas. The Nantucket area, the Buzzard's Bay area, has a long and rich history
as being important as a commercially viable fishing area. So that there are
also potential conflicts here with air rights with respect to flight paths, so
that the Federal Aviation Administration is also involved. So that this is
really a legal quagmire in a way, it's a cobweb of rights that touch off
jurisdiction on the part of three different levels of government and many local
jurisdictions and different state and federal agencies as well.</p>
<p>So the location in
the Sound that is being proposed is pretty much between and to the north of
Nantucket, which lies over here on the right side on the bottom, and Martha's
Vineyard, roughly five to six miles offshore. Now, this has become most
controversial because that is close enough so that the towers would be visible
from shoreline areas. So they've completed six years of environmental studies
of the surface and subsurface geology, wind, tide, waves, sediment transport
patterns, benthic infauna and shellfish resources, fish habitat, commercial and
recreational fisheries, and marine mammals and threatened and endangered
species.</p>
<p>And what's
interesting about this is also that they've been quite successful. Cape Wind,
the corporation, has been successful in federal court litigation. So that all
of the permitting on the part of local governments and the state government, is
now complete. This also fell under the requirements of the National
Environmental Policy Act that demanded that an environmental impact statement
be prepared. And this was done with great care and it also pointed to all of
the possible effects on fish, on wildlife, on endangered species, but also was
clear in identifying conflicts between the developers and the wind turbines
with the various interest groups that currently have rights to use the area.</p>
<p>So that state
permitting status is complete as of the Fall of 2008. And there's a Facility
Siting Board in Massachusetts. There is a state environmental quality permitting
process that was required to be complied with. There also are state wetlands
laws in Massachusetts that are particularly protective of coastal wetlands so
that all of these permits have been now granted. The federal permitting status
is managed by the Minerals Management Service, and that sits within the
Department of the Interior. So that a favorable draft impact statement was
prepared in 2004 and then it released a favorable final Environment Impact Statement
on January 15 of 2008.</p>
<p>Favorable comments on
the part of different organizations, including the Natural Resources Defense
Council, known for being very protective of coastal areas around the nation and
being very concerned about issues of climate change. "Cape Wind (NRDC
argued) is to our knowledge the largest single source of supply-side reductions
in CO<sub>2</sub> currently proposed in the United States and perhaps the
world." And the Department of Energy assistant secretary said, "As
the first shallow-water offshore project under review in the United States,
utility-scale projects like Cape Wind are important to our national interests
and a crucial first step to building a domestic globally competitive wind
supply." And another former U.S. Department of Energy assistant secretary
and now Massachusetts Secretary of Environmental Officers, Susan Tierney
commented, "The Cape Wind draft environmental impact statement is
thorough, it's detailed. It identifies and analyzes and describes a wide array
of impacts with great care, detail, and comprehensiveness. Indeed, it's one of
the most thorough that I've ever seen." So wide support among a variety of
different agencies.</p>
<p>Now, right now the
Cape Wind Company is awaiting a decision on the part of Ken Salazar, who is the
Secretary of the Interior. And Ken Salazar is responsible for the National Park
Service that also sits within the Department of the Interior. And you might ask
the question, well, what does the Park Service have to do with permitting for a
facility such as this? Well, the Park Service curiously is responsible because
of the National Historic Preservation Act. This requires that historic
facilities in the United States be identified and ranked for their relative
importance, and if they're found to be of national significance, they are
eligible to be placed on the National Registry of Historic Places. So that the
Secretary of the Interior-- I'm going to have to jump ahead here for a second.
The Secretary of the Interior had the ability to decide that either the
national significance of this as Native American burial grounds was so high
that it would be designated and therefore this wind farm would not be allowed
to go forward. And he's committed to reaching a conclusion about this within
the next two weeks, so pay attention to the press, it will turn out to be quite
interesting.</p>
<p>So the Secretary went
out and took a look at the site several months ago and has held a variety of
press conferences over the past couple of weeks that demonstrate that he is
really on the edge, not knowing whether or not he should be pursuing the
national objective of increasing the renewable energy portfolio of the United
States. I'm going to have to jump ahead here, because I've got way too much
material, so forgive me.</p>
<p>I wanted to talk just
a moment about comparing this case to other kinds of problems that we've
discussed in class or that you may be familiar with, and the idea of the
government role of providing either credits or subsidies. I want you to think
about the relative historical absence of federal subsidy of renewable energy
sources and compare that to the subsidies that have occurred for the oil
industry. And perhaps the greatest subsidy that I can think of is in part a
reflection on what happened when a major automobile company, tire company and
oil companies in the early 1900s went around to different cities and purchased
up the trolley lines, the tram lines. They purchased them up as a way of
diminishing the public's ability to use public transit and to develop an
increased reliance on automobiles.</p>
<p>Now think also about
the national cost to maintain and build or rebuild our national highway system.
And where would the auto industry and the oil industry be in the United States
if that were not accomplished by our tax dollars? So now I think about the
highway system as being really an enormous subsidy for the oil industry as well
as for the auto industries. Think also about how we have in the past year
subsidized the auto industry and banks as well, so that how do we come to
choose to subsidize certain private ventures and not others? We have a clear
problem that we need to deal with there.</p>
<p>I also want you think
about a variety of different conclusions with respect to land use regulation.
We've looked at land use regulation and we've looked at problems of controlling
private behavior, taking away rights from individuals on private land. And I
want you to think about the opportunities for a variety of new land use
regulation and subdivision regulation schemes that might zone lands for wind
farms, so that if you think back on the Adirondack Park zoning scheme, where
they did zone certain areas for industrial growth. They zoned other areas for
agricultural growth, food farms, that why not the concept of zoning for wind
farms?</p>
<p>Now, you could argue
that well, if you're going to zone for wind farms, you need to think about how
you're going to manage the externalities that might fall onto adjacent
landowners. Well, that could be dealt with, as I mentioned a few moments ago,
in a variety of ways. And these might include offering development credits to
adjacent landowners to increase density elsewhere. In other words, transferable
development rights might be a component of these land use regulations. So that
the adjacent landowners are actually given a bonus, they're given a development
right that would be assignable to an area that was zoned to receive increased
density. These would be bankable, so they wouldn't have to physically develop
it. They could put the credit into a bank and somebody else, another developer
who wanted to build in that high-density zone, could purchase that credit. So
there's a potential here to tie zoning for wind farms to transferrable
development rights. Require minimum acreages, a hundred acres, two hundred
acres, a thousand acres, whatever it would be. And regulate lot dimensions. So
you could imagine a thousand acres in a relatively narrow strip of land going
on for miles. But you could also think about how you might design lot dimension
requirements in a way that would ensure that you would have a separation
distance from the turbine to the adjacent landowners that might sense a fence.</p>
<p>We also need to think
carefully about zoning for new transmission lines. And zoning in corridors has
always been a part of local and state land use regulations. So think about
where the corridors are right here in New Haven. We have a rail corridor that
also serves as a highway corridor. It's also a power line corridor. So that
building new transmission lines in areas where rail and highway corridors
already exist make a lot of sense. If we have to buy new land to create new
transmission lines, that's going to be an extraordinarily expensive venture.
And think about again this problem of having the production being located in
large distance away from the points of higher population densities and
consumption.</p>
<p>So another conclusion
that I want you to walk away with here is with respect to property rights. So
that offshore development is going to be much easier to accomplish than onshore
development. Now here we are in 2010, the Cape Wind developers made their
proposal in 2001. They've wandered their way through this regulatory permitting
process for nine years. There's a lesson there. The lesson has been followed in
a variety of other regulatory contexts and it's called one-stop shopping,
one-stop shopping for a permit. What if we had one renewable agency, renewable
energy agency that had all of the authority to grant the permits? And yes, they
would have to consult with state representatives, they would have to consult with
local representatives. But a developer could go through this process perhaps in
three or four years instead of nine years. The capital carrying costs that are
involved here when you're purchasing property and trying to figure out what
state of technology you're going to apply, capital costs here are enormous and
can be discouraging. I mentioned the coal bed methane issue and think
distinctively about how that coal bed methane property right was allowed to be
purchased by the private sector, whereas the wind property right, like the
solar property right, is generally assigned with the surface lands. So who has
the right to block wind? Who has the right to block solar radiation? And are
these legitimate bases for civil actions as nuisances?</p>
<p>Now, I'd like to
close by having you think about damages and how we calculate damages. And as
you think about every case that we've discussed in this term, when we think
about environmental effects, you should be thinking about the magnitude of the
effect and you should be thinking about the distribution of the effect. So
think about this comparison between nuclear power on the one hand and wind
energy on the other. What are the adverse environmental effects from wind power
likely to be? Well, we've gone through a variety of them, biological resources,
land area that's going to be required. But they all pale in response to the
problems associated with constructing and operating nuclear power plants and
then figuring out what to do with the waste.</p>
<p>And one way to think
about distribution is just to think about how something spreads geographically.
But think about distribution in a temporal way as well. So that the fact that
the Environmental Protection Agency is required to develop a nuclear waste
disposal plan to cover one million years for the management of the Yucca
Mountain storage facility that has to do with the persistence of the
radionuclides, particularly plutonium isotopes. I mean, think about that, the
persistence of the problem over time is another way to consider distribution.
So the consideration of magnitude and distribution as well, by thinking about
questions of equity, who are these damages going to fall onto? How should they
be managed?</p>
<p>And some people are
much more capable of managing risk than other people are. So they can buy
higher quality insurance than poorer people can. So once again, magnitude and
distribution for a variety of different kinds of effects. So the effect in my
opinion on wildlife and fish, on noise, on esthetics and vibration, on the shadow
and flicker effects that are being studied, along with the vibration effects
right here in the Yale Medical School. There is a claim, by the way, that these
wind turbine farms create vibrations that you can't actually feel but they're
strong enough if you are in close enough proximity to these fields to have your
sleep disturbed. And also on property values and on recreational access, these
are the core points of contention. But compared to managing nuclear waste over
hundreds of thousands of years, these seem like relatively minor issues.</p>
<p>And I'd like to close
with just one thought, and that is as you think about difficult tradeoffs such
as this, I encourage you to consider the idea of reversibility. Reversibility
is a concept that has been built into a variety of different laws. So that
under many different statutes, the government is required to consider whether
or not the effect is reversible. So plutonium, the creation of plutonium is not
a reversible decision, given the length of persistence. The construction of a
coal-fired power plant such as you see here in the upper left, yeah, that's
reversible. You could pull that apart. But if we look at our history of
rehabilitation of damaged sites and industrial facilities in the nation, they
tend not to be rebuilt because they're so highly contaminated. Think about the
disassembly of a turbine farm or the disassembly of a solar generating facility
such as this out in the New Mexico desert. These are easily disassembled. So
just consider the idea of reversibility as you think about how these kinds of
choices might be made. Okay. Well, that is the end of lecture twenty-three, and
we'll wrap with a final lecture on Thursday. Thank you.</p>
