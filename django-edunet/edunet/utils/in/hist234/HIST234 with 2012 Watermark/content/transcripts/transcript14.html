<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Well good morning. I think we should get started. And what we&#39;ll be talking
about this morning is the germ theory of disease. In a sense, it&#39;s taken us
half a course to reach a period when we begin to see the development of what
you would probably recognize as a scientific modern medicine. To appreciate
the enormity of what happened with the germ theory of disease, I think it&#39;s
worth casting our eye back to a point we had already reached. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s say we compared
the year 1789 with 1900. Before 1789, and the developments with the Paris
School of Medicine, you&#39;ll remember the conceptual framework was dominated,
still, by that of Hippocrates, Galen and humoral medicine. Humoralism was in
retreat, as doctors were absorbing ideas about the circulatory system, and the
nervous system. But the medical philosophy, the vocabulary, therapeutics and
medical education, were still cast in the old framework, supplemented by other
developments--astrology, for example--and epidemic diseases were thought to be
explained by the doctrine of miasma--that is, the corruption or poisoning of
the air--or malaria, as it was called at the time. </p>
<p>By 1900, I think it&#39;s
clear that more change had occurred than in all of the centuries since
Hippocrates combined, and that medical science, whose basic principles were
recognizably similar to our own today, had emerged. Furthermore, the speed of
change was gathering momentum as the nineteenth century progressed. The
closing decades of the century witnessed a wholesale revolution, with the germ
theory of disease as its central feature. This theory, I&#39;m going to argue, was
as important a revolution in medicine as for, example, Galileo&#39;s theory of the
rotation of the earth was to astronomy; or perhaps Darwin&#39;s theory of natural
selection was to biology; or gravitation to physics. </p>
<p>So, what I would like
to begin with then is looking at what is the germ theory? What were its
preconditions? Who were the decisive figures? What were the decisive events
associated with that famous trio of Louis Pasteur, Joseph Lister, Robert Koch?
What were the implications? Let&#39;s avoid the idea of a single genius coming up
with a great idea. Let&#39;s question the vision behind the idea of the Nobel
Prize. I&#39;m going to be arguing that these discoveries, that culminate in the
germ theory, had a long gestation period, and were a collective process that
required a long train of preconditions. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at the
preconditions first. I&#39;ll argue that they&#39;re conceptual, technological and
institutional. Let&#39;s look at conceptual preconditions. The germ theory of
disease didn&#39;t arise directly out of hospital medicine and the Paris School,
but I think it&#39;s inconceivable without the background of that development. It
was crucial to have a nosology--that is, disease classification--the idea of
disease specificity--that they were specific entities--and without the idea of
localism; that is, lesions. And also essential was the new development of
pathological anatomy, derived from the post-mortem in the Paris hospitals. </p>
<p>The idea of
specificity was critical. Any further progress to the idea of a microbial
disease depended on the view that diseases didn&#39;t transform from one into
another. Before the Paris School, it was common to believe, for example, that
cholera--to take one disease--was simply a heightened form of endemic summer
diarrhea. It wasn&#39;t a specific disease, and it grew out of another preexisting
condition. The germ theory depended instead on the conviction that there are
stable, unchanging disease entities, that each one is specific and has a
specific microbial cause. But the followers of Louis--Pierre Louis, that is--in
Paris, while carefully distinguishing one disease from another, and classifying
them, didn&#39;t advance much towards the idea of the causative pathogens behind
them. </p>
<p>Now, when we&#39;ve
talked about the Paris School, I don&#39;t want to give you the idea that all of
the crucial figures in disease specificity, and nosology, were French. There
were other crucial figures as well. William Gerhard, who distinguished typhus
from typhoid. He had studied in Paris with Louis for a couple of years, and
then returned to his native Philadelphia. During an epidemic of typhus, he
dissected hundreds of cadavers and discovered that their lesions had no
resemblance whatsoever to typhoid. </p>
<p>There was William
Budd, who wrote an important book called <i>Typhoid Fever: Its Nature, Mode of
Spreading and Prevention</i>, in 1873. And he referred to the unchanging,
specific nature of the disease. Let&#39;s listen to what he said. He said this:
&quot;To propagate itself and no other, and that on a series of indefinite
progressions, constitutes the very essence of the relation on which the idea of
species is founded. How much this applies in the animal and plant world we all
know. It is strange that what it implies, in the case of diseases, should be
so seldom recognized until now.&quot; </p>
<p>Or there was Pierre
Bretonneau, who believed that there were morbid seeds that caused special
diseases, just as every seed--in the natural history, that is--gives rise to a
determined species. And he applied that idea to diphtheria. Just so as apples
don&#39;t turn into wheat--apples seeds into wheat--so too endemic diarrhea doesn&#39;t
transform itself into Asiatic cholera. There was an important transitional
figure too. Claude Bernard, of the Paris School, one of its stars, who lived
from 1813 to 1878, and in 1865 wrote an important book called <i>An Introduction
to the Study of Experimental Medicine</i>, where he presented a critique of the
Paris School. He argued that diseases were dynamic processes. They weren&#39;t
static in the way that the Paris idea of nosology seemed to suggest. And he
argued that they, hospitals, displayed the end stages of diseases, not their
beginnings. And he argued that hospitals and clinics had an excess of
variables that wasn&#39;t helpful for the further development of medical science.
So, he proposed an alternative, that was embodied in his title; that is,
experimental medicine. And by that, he meant laboratory medicine. He&#39;s one of
the people who suggest a new epistemology for medicine, which isn&#39;t the
hospital ward but the lab, where you could have the experimental testing of
single variables in controlled settings. Here was a new source of medical
knowledge. </p>
<p>If that provides
conceptual preconditions, there were also institutional ones. And here I&#39;m
thinking of the rise of the laboratory, of the university; that is, full-time
professional scientists, research institutions, and Germany leading the way,
rather than France, in this development. There were also technological
foundations. It&#39;s impossible to think of the rise of the germ theory of
disease without microscopy. And so it was indebted to Anton van Leeuwenhoek, who lived from 1632
to 1723, and developed the simple microscope. And then in the 1820s, and
thereafter, there were major improvements: the development of the compound
microscope and higher magnification, the work of the Zeiss Company and the
development of lenses. </p>
<p>There was also, for a
fourth precondition, a lonely, neglected pioneer, and that was a Hungarian
gynecologist, who lived in Vienna, called Ignaz Phillip Semmelweis, whose crucial idea,
which dates from the 1840s--Semmelweis noted that the infection rate in
childbirth was much lower on obstetrical wards where women were delivered by
midwives, rather than on wards where they were delivered by physicians. The
reason had nothing to do with their training or relative degree of benevolence
and malevolence. The point was that the physicians were just returning from
post-mortem examinations, from autopsies, after which, at that time, they
didn&#39;t wash their hands, and so they were transmitting disease to their patients,
from autopsies they were performing in an adjacent building. </p>
<p>So, Semmelweis,
suspecting--although he didn&#39;t know the mechanism--that this was the case,
established elaborate hand-washing rituals, using a chlorinated lime
solution--a little bit the first hand sanitizer, we might say--and he noted
that mortality plummeted from twenty percent to one percent. Unfortunately,
his own career was not a happy one. He was mocked by his colleagues as a
charlatan, and was actually demoted in his own hospital. Well, then, there&#39;s a
fifth precondition, and that&#39;s the development of the basic sciences. And it&#39;s
hard to imagine, as we&#39;ll see in a minute, the rival of the germ theory without
chemistry in particular. </p>
<p>The specific issue
that gave rise to the germ theory of disease was fermentation. And Pasteur,
after all, was originally a chemist, who in the 1860s became a biologist, and
we should note that he wasn&#39;t a physician. This is to introduce you to Louis
Pasteur. The immediate background to the germ theory of disease involved the
dominant theory of the day, which was called the zymotic theory of disease;
that is, that it was a form of ferment--a little bit like Pettenkofer had
asserted--caused by some fermentation of decaying organic material. Under the
right conditions of soil, temperature and moisture, this fermentation would
give off a poison into the environment. </p>
<p>Also quite widespread
was the idea of spontaneous generation, that diseases arose somehow
spontaneously in a particular locality, weren&#39;t brought in or imported from the
outside. There was a famous experiment about this, from the seventeenth
century. It was Redi&#39;s maggot experiment. The idea was that if you could have
rotting meat, and you could cover it, you wouldn&#39;t develop maggots. But if you
didn&#39;t cover it, then you would find that it was full of maggots. So, the
maggots didn&#39;t appear in the rotting meat by some internal mechanism of
spontaneous generation, but were imported from outside. And Pasteur, as we&#39;ll
see in a minute, takes up this very idea, to the idea that germs too, like the
maggots, are imported from outside. </p>
<p>The immediate issue
for Pasteur was in fact fermentation. He began by studying the fermentation of
wine and beer, and in particular their spoilage. At the time, this was
thought, when he took up his work, to be a chemical process. And remember that
Pasteur was not a physician but a chemist originally. Well, what he did was to
discover that the fermentation was caused instead by living microorganisms, bacteria
that he identified through the microscope. Now, this was a high-profile
investigation in the 1860s, for the simple reason that the production of wine
and beer involved two of France&#39;s major economic activities. </p>
<p>Pasteur--and this was
part of his genius--immediately made a far-reaching connection. In his
estimate, the fermentation that he saw in wine and beer, now caused by
bacteria, was analogous to putrefaction and infection in wounds, for example.
So, he began to regard disease as a process involving microorganisms, living
things. This was work that Pasteur conducted in the late 1850s and 1860s, and
it marked the first transformation in his career from that of a chemist into a
biologist, or we might say today a microbiologist. He examined not only wine
and beer, he then turned his attention to milk and its souring, and he wrote a
book on that, and then a study on wine and a study on beer. </p>
<p>Now, of great
importance was the fact that Pasteur&#39;s discovery that abnormal fermentation
leads to spoilage, along with that went another discovery he made, which was
that this process could be controlled by heat. Here was a major public health
discovery, and that led to the process we now know as pasteurization. So,
already in the 1860s, Pasteur was busily transforming biology. Even if had he
stopped then, his discoveries were already those of a fully productive life&#39;s
work. But then in the 1860s came a turn in Pasteur&#39;s interests from biology,
more specifically to medicine and public health. And he began to study
spontaneous generation. Now, followers of Pasteur believed instead in
biogenesis. </p>
<p>With regard to
cholera, that we already examined, about which there was a debate, the idea was
that cholera was imported from outside. It didn&#39;t arise spontaneously. It
wasn&#39;t the transformation of some other disease that already existed into
cholera. Rather it was a specific disease that could not arise as a heightened
form of a pre-existing condition. Pasteur also devised--well, Koch didn&#39;t think
this was so elegant, but it certainly convinced Pasteur and his followers--a
famous swan neck flask experiment. That is, he sterilized a flask with a
swan&#39;s neck, and found that if the culture is boiled, and the flask prevents
air from gaining access to it, then there was no development inside of
organisms that we would call bacteria. A culture of them could grow in the
flask, only if germs were allowed to enter it. But if the neck of the flask is
broken and air is emitted--you can see the neck broken at the bottom--then you
get a luxurious development of life. And this had enormous implications for
diseases and wounds. </p>
<p>Pasteur wrote simply,
&quot;There is no known circumstance in which it can be confirmed that
microscopic beings came into the world without germs, without parents similar
to themselves.&quot; Now, Pasteur&#39;s success was partly based on the fact that
he was aware of the full range of the scientific implications of his work, and
he selected carefully topics with high profile, philosophical and biological
interest. He was an expert at cultivating the media. That was one reason that
spontaneous generation had led to so much excitement. But most decisive in
Pasteur&#39;s work was what he did in the 1870s, as he turned to diseases,
demonstrating the full implications of his ideas on fermentation in the
previous decade. This new phase of discovery occurred, despite the fact that
in 1868 he suffered a major cerebral hemorrhage, that left him paralyzed on his
left side. </p>
<p>What did Pasteur do
in the 1870s that was so crucial? Well, first of all, I&#39;ll look at two major
things that he did. One is work with silkworms, and the other is work with
chicken cholera and anthrax. The first thing was a major contribution to the
germ theory of disease, accomplished by the work with an unexpected
experimental animal; that is, the silkworm. And again let&#39;s look at the fact
that Pasteur&#39;s success, his influence and his genius, was in part the fact that
he took on really high-profile research topics; that is to say, disease of silkworms,
where these diseases were decimating one of France&#39;s leading industries, that
is, silk. </p>
<p>Through meticulous
and painstaking research, Pasteur demonstrated that there were two major
diseases at work affecting France&#39;s silkworms. He called them pebrine and
flacherie--you needn&#39;t remember them for our purposes--and asserted that both
were specific diseases caused by bacteria. And he immediately realized that
there were enormous implications, not only for silkworms, but for human beings
as well. He isolated then two germs affecting silkworms, and demonstrated
that they were responsible for specific contagious diseases. </p>
<p>Pasteur isolated a
germ and convincingly linked it with a specific disease, and the concept of
specificity was at the basis then of the whole idea of the germ theory of
disease. Now you know Pasteur didn&#39;t invent the idea of contagion. You&#39;ve
seen it with Fracastoro. You&#39;ve seen it in John Snow, who talked about the
possibility of animalcules. And there were other scientists--Casimir Devaine in
France, the English physician John Sanderson--who were also advancing a
hypothesis that they were finding microbes with their microscopes, and
hypothesizing that they might be the agents of disease. But Pasteur was the
first to provide a demonstration in a specific case, proving that microbes were
the causative agents of specific diseases, and he provided a methodology for
further experimentation and discovery. </p>
<p>Pasteur then turned
from silkworms to diseases, the diseases of chicken cholera and anthrax.
Neither is responsible for extensive human disease, as both are causes of
diseases of animals. But what was critical was the process. His work on
anthrax helped to establish a model for investigating infectious diseases, and
establishing the claims for the germ theory of disease, and putting that on
solid foundation. At the same time, he made another major development. His
vision went beyond simply demonstrating the germ theory, although he did that.
In addition, he developed a public health practice-- that is, vaccination,
which had been pioneered a hundred years before--and he helped now to found the
discipline of experimental immunology. </p>
<p>Now, let&#39;s--we&#39;ve
seen vaccination and the work of Edward Jenner. Let&#39;s define. Vaccination is
the introduction into the body of either the whole, or part, of a
disease-causing microorganism, in order to teach the immune system to attack
that same organism, should it reappear in the body through natural processes.
The mechanism is that the vaccine primes the immune system to produce
antibodies, or teaches immune cells to recognize and attack the organism, that
we now know perhaps to be a virus, a bacterium, or a parasite of a different
kind. The problem, of course, was how to stimulate immunity without causing
disease. Jenner benefited from the cross-over immunity from cowpox to
smallpox. Pasteur did something else. He used the concept of attenuation.</p>
<p>Jenner is the father
of immunology, in a sense, Pasteur the founder of experimental immunology. The
idea he had was that live pathogens could be introduced in the body, but only
after being treated in some way--heat, for example, or passage through a
different host first was another--in such a way then that their virulence is
diminished. Then they&#39;ll stimulate the immune response, without causing
disease at all, or only a mild disease. </p>
<p>This discovery was
made during his work with the bacterium that causes chicken cholera, made sort
of by chance--serendipity played a role. He left a batch of bacteria untouched
for a week or so while he went on vacation during the hot summer months. On
returning, he found initially, to his frustration, that the culture no longer
produced the disease when he attempted to infect other chickens. So, he got a
fresh batch of bacterium, and injected the same chickens with it, as well as a
lot of new chickens, and made a surprising discovery. That the original
chickens, injected with the old vaccine, remained healthy--in our terms, they
were immune--while the new and previously untreated chickens sickened and
died. He repeated the experiment several times, with the same results, and
concluded that the summer heat had changed or attenuated the culture of the
bacterium.</p>
<p>Later techniques
expanded the repertoire, demonstrating that heat could kill vaccines of chicken
cholera but still induce immunity. There were other vaccines that could employ
live but attenuated bacteria or viruses. Some used killed microorganisms.
Some used sub-unit vaccines. And the processes of attenuation are not only
heat, but let&#39;s say for polio, could be the passage through formaldehyde and
various--there are other means. Attenuation though was critical to the
development of vaccine as a public health strategy. But let&#39;s return to
Pasteur. Having discovered attenuation with chicken cholera, Pasteur applied
the same principle to the different disease of anthrax. The pathogen
responsible was the <i>Bacillus
anthracis</i>
that had recently been isolated by Robert Koch. And if you see the film, <i>The
Story of Louis Pasteur</i>, you&#39;ll see what he did in 1881 with the bacterium.</p>
<p>In a famous
experiment, he vaccinated twenty-four sheep with an attenuated--that is,
heated--bacterium, after which he challenged the original twenty-four sheep
with live unattenuated anthrax injections, as well as twenty-four control sheep
that had not been vaccinated. The vaccinated sheep remained healthy. The
non-vaccinated all died. Then came the 1880s, and Pasteur turned to another
high profile disease, and that is rabies. Having discovered attenuation by
heat, with chicken cholera and anthrax, Pasteur extended the principle of
attenuation by other means. This involved further famous experiments. </p>
<p>Rabies, as it turns
out, was not another bacterial disease, but a disease caused by what we now
know to be a virus. In this case, he attenuated the virus by isolating it from
foxes, and then passing it through an unnatural host of a different species; in
this case, the rabbit. So, passing the virus through a series of rabbit
bodies, he succeeded in producing a variant that would no longer cause the
infection in foxes, but would serve to protect against the natural occurring
rabies. Rabies was not a high impact disease, in terms of numbers of people it
affected, but it was a disease of high drama, and one that was then, and still
is, universally fatal. So, it was ideal for attracting media attention. </p>
<p>The great human trial
occurred in July 1885, with a famous case of a nine-year-old boy, Joseph
Meister, who had been severely bitten by a rabid dog and was thought to be
certain to die an agonizing death. But taking advantage of the incubation
period for rabies, Pasteur vaccinated the boy with his attenuated rabies
virus. Joseph Meister survived, and became a celebrity patient, the first
person ever known to have survived after being severely bitten by a rabid
animal. And Meister remained loyal for the rest of his life, to Pasteur. He
returned, as an adult, to Paris, to work as a gatekeeper at the Pasteur
Institute, where Pasteur himself was buried in the crypt. The apocryphal
story--I won&#39;t assert its truth--the story is that he was killed in 1940, as an
elderly man, when he tried to prevent occupying German troops from desecrating
Pasteur&#39;s grave, the grave of a national icon of an enemy power. A slightly
less poignant but better documented narrative is that he committed suicide in
despair of the German occupation. </p>
<p>Well, the Pasteur
Institute--that&#39;s the vaccination of Joseph Meister. It&#39;s not Pasteur doing
the actual vaccination, because, as I said, he wasn&#39;t a physician. And this is
the Pasteur Institute, founded in 1887, with Louis Pasteur himself as its first
director, committed to biomedical research in Paris, and to a series of
satellite institutes elsewhere in the world. It followed the public health
strategy of vaccination, pioneered by Jenner, and now consolidated by Pasteur.
The founding of this institute--you&#39;ll note its size and imposing nature--gives
us the opportunity to note in passing another aspect of nineteenth and
twentieth century science. The way in which it became a focal point for
competing nationalisms, in a way familiar to us from the Cold War competition
between the U.S. and the USSR. In any case, there&#39;s a clear case in the
nineteenth century with the rivalry between Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch, the
embodiments and icons of French and German medical science, of two hostile
national powers. The Pasteur Institute in Paris rivaled the Koch Institute in
Berlin. And that brings us--we&#39;ll also note the crypt where Pasteur is
buried. </p>
<p>There&#39;s a kind
of--what shall I say?--worship of Pasteur almost, and of French medical
science. But let&#39;s move on to Robert Koch, who lived from 1843 to 1910, the
second great figure in the establishment of the germ theory of disease, the
German scientist who was twenty years younger than Pasteur. Now, if Pasteur&#39;s
hallmark was the imaginative breadth of his scientific vision, Koch&#39;s
distinctive feature was his scientific rigor, his more rigorous techniques of
microbiology. He had a critique, a famous critique, of the whole swan neck
flask experiment. He argued that Pasteur had been lucky--contamination was
possible. He developed the plate technique, using the Petri dish and solid
culture, and he developed staining techniques for microscopy. </p>
<p>What I&#39;d particularly
like you to note is his methodology, which he embodied in what are called &quot;Koch&#39;s
Postulates.&quot; This was the methodology for determining that a suspected microbe
is the causative agent of a particular disease. He said you could know this
under four conditions. First, the organism suspected as a pathogen must be
found in all animals suffering from the disease. In other words, it has to be
universally present where the disease is present. And then the organism must
be isolated from a diseased animal, and grown in culture. Third, the cultured
organism must cause the disease, when introduced into a healthy animal. And
lastly, the organism must be re-isolated from the experimentally infected
animal. These postulates are some of the most famous in medical science, and
were the model for establishing germs as pathogens for other diseases. </p>
<p>Koch&#39;s microscopy had
a number of immediate implications. His staining raised the idea that if you
could stain, you could also have an idea of magic bullets, what later became
antibiotics. But Koch didn&#39;t pursue that particular interest. The other was
this led to reliable differential diagnosis, and therefore a more properly
based nosology. It could lead also to major public health measures, and
ultimately to developments in therapeutics. It furthered the sanitary idea,
and gave it a firm, scientific basis, and irrefutably proved the truth of
contagionism rather than anticontagionism, as Pettenkofer learned, to his
cost. But immediately there wasn&#39;t--it didn&#39;t imply, and I think we should
note this--the understanding of disease did not immediately lead to therapeutic
advances.</p>
<p>Remember what
happened in Naples during the cholera of 1884. Koch&#39;s idea was used for a very
negative therapeutic method; that is, acid enemas that were administered to
patients. Well Koch also moved forward on other diseases, applying the methods
he had developed, that Pasteur had developed in the 1870s, and applying his own
rigorous postulates. In 1882, the most famous of all, he isolated the
bacterium that causes tuberculosis, the most prevalent disease of the time.
The paper that Koch presented in 1882 was one of the most dramatic and
important moments in the history of medicine. Tuberculosis was not feared in
the same way cholera was, but it was unquestionably the greatest killer of the
nineteenth century, and until 1882, it was shrouded in mystery. Suddenly Koch
cast a new shaft of life, revealing to the world that he had unraveled the
entire mystery of its etiology. </p>
<p>Then, in 1883, he
followed up this discovery with another that was almost equally influential.
In 1883, he isolated the <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Koch then had discovered and
demonstrated the role of pathogens, the ones responsible for two of the most
prevalent and feared nineteenth century diseases. This marked, as I said, the
definitive triumph of contagionism. And the 1880s and &#39;90s were a golden age
of microbiology, with the pathogens being discovered for a whole range of other
diseases. This was an extraordinary period in medical science. The pathogens
were discovered for gonorrhea, bubonic plague, dysentery, tetanus, the common
bacteria of wound infections, staph infections and others. The paradox, of
course, there were still few benefits for patients, until the turn of the new
century. </p>
<p>The quip was made
that the main beneficiaries, at first, of the germ theory of disease, were
physicians rather than patients. But there was a major exception, and that was
not in medicine but in surgery. And this introduces the third major figure of
our trio, establishing the germ theory of disease, and that&#39;s Joseph Lister,
who lived from 1827 to 1912, and made his major contributions in Scotland. He
was professor of surgery at Edinburgh University, where he was appalled by the
numbers of patients who died after otherwise successful operations. You know
the old joke about the operation being successful, just too bad the patient
died. Well, Pasteur&#39;s idea immediately struck him for its lifesaving,
practical implications. That is, he made practical use of Pasteur&#39;s discovery
about the role of airborne germs in causing wound infections in surgery. </p>
<p>Now, surgery, before
Lister, had a number of major limits. There was pain itself, and the need for
speed. There was blood loss, and there was septicemia. The result was that
the major body cavities remained off limits: the abdominal cavity, the thoracic
cavity, the cranial cavity. And there was a high rate of death from
infection. The idea was thought by physicians at the time that the infection
arose through spontaneous generation. As tissue died, they gave off toxins
that caused infection, and so infection was simply accepted as an inevitable,
normal part of surgery. Lister&#39;s surgical revolution occurred with the work he
published, &quot;<a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1">On the Antiseptic
Principle in the Practice of Surgery,</a>&quot; in 1864. </p>
<p>The implications of
Pasteur&#39;s work on fermentation were that--you could have an analogy. If
Pasteur was right, there was no spontaneous generation. An airborne
microorganism penetrated the wound and caused infection or septicemia. The
remedy was to prevent the penetration of the microorganism, the idea of
antisepsis. So, Lister accepted Pasteur&#39;s insight that infections were not a
chemical reaction, caused by oxidation when air touched a wound. Instead,
infection was the result of contamination, from the outside, of the wound by
microorganisms. His solution first was this, the carbolic spray device that he
invented. What you did was to spray the air around the patient, applying
carbolic acid also directly to the wound. And Lister also washed his hands
before operating, and sterilized his instruments. There&#39;s a stylized idea of a
Lister-type surgical technique at work. </p>
<p>Well, until Lister&#39;s
revolutionary innovation, surgery had been an emergency, a treatment of last
resort, because of the wound infection. After 1866, it became a normal
procedure. There were other innovations as well, that went with it. His
contemporaries improved on Lister. You&#39;ll see that here they aren&#39;t wearing
masks, for example, or gowns. Those are introduced--and gloves made from
vulcanized rubber--were introduced in the 1890s, but really became a part of
best practice only from about the time of the First World War. This also
revolutionalized obstetrics, with the conquest of puerperal fever,
with--hospital and clinical procedures then were transformed by the antiseptic
idea. So, by the 1890s, you have the consolidation of the germ theory of
disease, revolutionalizing medicine and become accepted throughout the
international medical profession. </p>
<p>I&#39;d like to mention
the impact also on culture. And this particular book, which is by Bram Stoker,
which is <i>Dracula</i>, published in 1897, that gives us, I would argue,
expression in a really dramatic and--I just read it again--a really scary--I
assure you--idea of anxieties about infection. Now, <i>Dracula</i> is really,
for its time, a high-tech novel. In it you see all about the latest scientific
and medical inventions and ideas. It contains the phonograph, the telephone,
stenography, railroads, the two-wheeled bicycle. And in medicine it deals with
the latest inventions in psychiatry, in blood transfusion, infectious
diseases. And indeed, I would argue, it also involves what was the cutting
edge scientific idea in medicine at the time, the possibility of vector borne
diseases like malaria and filarial.</p>
<p>Then it&#39;s just at the
time when we&#39;re going to see tropical medicine--we&#39;ll look at next
time--becomes the cutting edge of late nineteenth-century, early twentieth-century
medical science. Now, you know the drill about Dracula, how Count Dracula--the
word <i>Dracula</i> comes from the Romanian word <i>dracul</i>, which means a
devil, a little devil. And you know how he lived, the Count--the evil
Count--in Transylvania, in Romania, in the Carpathian Mountains. And the
important point is he travels by ship from the Black Sea port, aboard a Russian
vehicle, through the Mediterranean, and up along the coast of Spain and France,
where he lands by ship in Britain at the port of Whitby. Then he travels by
train, and is transported by railroad from Whitby to London, where his plan is
to ravage the huge population of London. </p>
<p>Now, what does that
remind you of? Doesn&#39;t that--it reminds me--I&#39;m going to argue that <i>Dracula</i>
is many things. In literature, you&#39;ll see that <i>Dracula</i> is a
metaphor--and this is often said--for repressed sexuality, in the Victorian
Era. You&#39;ll find interpretations of it as expressing also a repressed
homoeroticism. In it, we also find expression of the battle of good and evil.
That&#39;s our friend Dracula. And you&#39;ll see--love never dies--the idea of--the
sexual idea is clearly--some 200 films have been made of <i>Dracula</i>. And
you can see clearly possible sexual ideas in films such as this. And they&#39;re
clearly also here. But what I want to argue is what&#39;s been neglected so
often--and I think it&#39;s really important--is I want to argue that <i>Dracula</i>
is also an allegory of infectious disease; not a specific disease, but diseases
like plague and cholera, that originated in Eastern Europe and traveled, just
as Dracula did, by ship and by railroad; that they had Count Dracula&#39;s goal of
ravaging industrial cities, huge population centers like London. </p>
<p>And it&#39;s interesting
that the vampire hunters in the novel are doctors, physicians, whose mission is
to destroy the invading vampire. Also involved, we see, is the seasonality.
It&#39;s not by chance that Count Dracula arrives in late August/September, just as
cholera would have, or bubonic plague. And we see miasmatism in the novel: the
flowers, the garlic, the mists surrounding Dracula. And I would argue that
Dracula is a composite of many infections. Here&#39;s the handsome count again.
And I&#39;d like to show you one more handsome picture of him; and that&#39;s that
one. And I would argue that this clearly makes me think also of vector-borne
disease, and possibly this is a million miles removed from malaria and
filarial, which we&#39;ll be talking about next week. So, I urge you also to read <i>Dracula</i>.
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy it as much as I did. </p>
