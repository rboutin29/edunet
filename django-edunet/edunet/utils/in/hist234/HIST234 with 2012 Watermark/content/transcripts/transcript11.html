<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden: </b>This
morning we&#39;ll take up one of the themes--that is to say, we&#39;ve described how
the course is about specific diseases, but it&#39;s also about a number of
overarching themes, and one of those is the development of various public
health strategies. So far, as you&#39;ll remember, we&#39;ve dealt with three public
health strategies. One was the system of plague measures: sanitary cordons,
lazarettos, quarantine, and all the rest of it. We&#39;ve dealt with vaccination
as a public health strategy, with regard to smallpox in particular. And we&#39;ve
talked about a third policy, if we want to dignify it in that way, and this was
the strategy of concealment. </p>
<p>This morning I want
to talk about a fourth approach to public health, and this was what&#39;s called
commonly the sanitary movement. This was pioneered in Britain in the 1830s and
&#39;40s, and it was then exported to the continent in North America, assuming
particular forms in France and Italy, with the actual rebuilding of cities in
accord with sanitary principles. Now, the sanitary movement was the first to
define itself as a public health movement, and it had two essential meanings
for its term. The first was the prevention of infectious epidemic diseases,
and the second was the removal of filth. So, it&#39;s based, in a sense, on the
relationship of filth and disease. Indeed, many people talk about the filth
theory of disease as lying at the basis of the sanitary movement. Its focus,
therefore, was on the towns and cities that had sprung up with urbanization and
the industrial revolution. </p>
<p>Epidemic diseases
disproportionately claimed their victims in the cities, and correspondingly the
legacy of lasting effects was especially pronounced in urban areas, and the
sanitary movement is one of those lasting legacies. Now, there is a theory
that we may as well look at, just for a second, developed by the British
physician and demographer, Thomas McKeown--and it&#39;s often called his
thesis--where he was dealing with the demographic fact of what he called a
mortality revolution; a demographic transition in which cities, for the first
time, become places that are dependent for their expansion not only on inward
migration to the towns, but on the fact that the longevity and the birthrate
come to exceed the death rate; which was something new, a real demographic
revolution. </p>
<p>And why was this
achieved? Many people have thought and postulated that it was due to medical
science, to conscious policy and those sorts of explanations. McKeown instead
stresses two factors. He sees this as largely unplanned and due to improved
nutrition, but also--and that&#39;s the point this morning--to the role of
sanitation. In other words, the population explosion, the demographic
revolution, is something that he postulates was due to, not to medical science,
but rather to the sanitary movement, and also to nutrition.</p>
<p>Well, what was the
background to the sanitary movement? We&#39;ve seen and mentioned that there
really was a tremendous challenge to health in this period of the industrial
revolution in European history. There were tremendous changes afoot in British
society. There was the rise of a modern commercial agriculture, and with it
enclosure, the driving of peasants off the land. We know about the major
demographic growth that was underway by this period, supported by the new
agriculture and the fading of the threat of famine and the fading of the threat
of plague. There was the rise of manufacture, and then the factory system,
especially the textile industry, and the associated and unregulated horrors of
things such as long hours, low wages, child labor. You know, too, that across
Europe, urban populations doubled in the first half of the nineteenth century,
and in so doing overwhelmed the infrastructure of available jobs, the housing
stock, sanitary arrangements, and all the rest, so that we see the rise of
tenement slums, sweatshops. </p>
<p>There was a mass
movement of population from countryside to town, and with that went
psychological adjustments. There was a breakdown of older notions of social
relations based on paternalism, of the customary notion of a moral economy
based on moral obligation. And we see instead the rise of the principles of
impersonal relations, of a free-market economy, and laissez-faire, epitomized
in the new discipline of political economy, with such figures, of course, as
Adam Smith, Ricardo, Jeremy Bentham, Thomas Malthus. The result, along with
those transformations, was a rise of new social tensions. We&#39;ve talked about
the nineteenth century as the rebellious century. </p>
<p>Now, in Britain,
there were no social and political revolutions, nothing comparable to 1789 in
France, or to what happened on the continent in 1830, and in 1848 and &#39;49. But
contemporaries weren&#39;t certain at all that this was going to be a lasting
fortune for Britain, and indeed Britain did have a number of signs of severe
social tension as well. There were large-scale riots. One could mention the
Chartist Movement, and in the countryside the movement known as Captain Swing.
</p>
<p>So, urban and
industrial centers, also in Britain, were perceived as dangerous, politically,
for fear of the so-called dangerous classes who rioted, perhaps committed
crime, threatened revolution, and were dangerous medically, as well; that is,
they were infected with cholera and other diseases. And it was cholera in
particular that was a real prod to action, this new and most feared disease of
the nineteenth century. It&#39;s not by chance, then, that the sanitary movement
begins in the 1830s and &#39;40s in Britain, after, that is to say, the first
pandemic and the second of Asiatic cholera. And it lasts intermittently down
through the First World War. </p>
<p>And this really was a
vast movement. It was nothing less than the retrofitting of the urban centers
of the nation, with the specific goal of removing filth, because filth was held
to be the cause of disease. So, we&#39;re talking about one of the great public
works projects of modern history: the establishment of sewer systems, a whole
infrastructure of water mains, of waste removal, street cleansing, improved and
less crowded housing, the creation of parks and public spaces. We can see that
Victorian Britain truly was preoccupied with that combination of excrement and
water. </p>
<p>All of this, of
course, presupposed as well the emergence of a modern state. It was state
power that alone provided the wealth and organizational structures that were
needed to carry out this enormous project. And in turn we can see the causal
chain working in both ways, because the sanitary movement was a very important
factor in reinforcing state power. Its implementation meant that the state now
invaded areas of life formerly regarded as private, and appropriated for itself
enormous new powers. And the reformers were supported by Protestant and
especially evangelical Christian churches. </p>
<p>Well, who were the
leaders of this movement? I think we should turn first of all to this man, Sir
Edwin Chadwick. This is Edwin, Sir Edwin, in his younger days. This may be a
slightly more familiar picture of him, I guess maybe at my age. In any case,
Sir Edwin wrote a major work collaboratively--he produced it, let us say--which
was called &quot;The Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring
Population of Great Britain of 1842.&quot; Now, Chadwick wasn&#39;t a physician at
all, and this is part of the background perhaps to the thesis I was mentioning
earlier. He was instead a lawyer by training from Manchester. And he was
already well known, in particular for his reform of welfare provisions in
Britain; that is, he was responsible in large part, for the passage, from the
old poor law, which had provided relief as the birthright of every citizen in
distress; that is, the right to some form of assistance or aid in time of
distress. </p>
<p>Chadwick&#39;s idea was
to economize, to minimize the cost of payments, to discourage the poor from
applying for relief. He wanted to make the experience of receiving relief more
painful than the experience of distress itself, a principle that was dubbed
&quot;the principle of least eligibility.&quot; The workhouse, in other words,
was to be a place of punishment, of pain and of suffering. So, work should be,
in the workhouse, more unpleasant than any to be found in the labor market.
And the diet should be intentionally made to be loathsome, more so than what
could be found by the poor outside. The poor law bureaucracy was also invoked,
and was an essential foundation of the information on which Chadwick relied for
the sanitary report of the laboring population of Great Britain. </p>
<p>This was the man who
was the same in both faces, with the new poor law and with the sanitary
report. The sanitary reform was also a stark assertion of state power as a
means of social control. The intention was to discipline and civilize the
working classes in the interests of social stability. Following in the wake of
the report was the establishment of a Public Health Act of 1848 in Britain, and
a general Board of Health, and such champions of sanitary reform as John Simon,
Thomas Southwood Smith and Neil Arnott. </p>
<p>Now, let&#39;s talk for a
minute about this man&#39;s ideology and his intentions. This was a class-based
movement. It was top-down and centralizing. In Chadwick&#39;s mind, the poor were
largely responsible for their own plight. They weren&#39;t innocent, and they
certainly weren&#39;t harmless. His mission was to cleanse and civilize the
dangerous classes. As I said, he wasn&#39;t a physician, and his reforms were not
based on any new medical discoveries, on scientific experimentation or
observation to determine what measures were most effective by determining the
causes of disease. His reform measures, enormous as they were, were based more
on what was the commonsense of the period and a priori assumptions. </p>
<p>Public health, in
this way, was separate from the development of medical science. His view--and
this was widely accepted--was that medicine was about private persons, not so
much public policy. And his idea was to use public policy to cleanse the urban
environment, but not to deal with other social and economic determinants of
disease. We&#39;ll talk about that in a moment. We need to think about not only
about what Chadwick wanted to do, but we also need to think about what he
decided not to do, what wasn&#39;t important to him. And so we should see this as
progress, yes, but progress that came at a cost, and we want to know about that
as well. </p>
<p>Now, an influence on
Chadwick&#39;s thinking was &quot;The Essay on Population&quot; of Thomas Malthus,
who believed that there was a law that in every society population pressure
sooner or later pressed against the limits of subsistence. So, real
improvement for the poor was likely to be illusory, short-term, and perhaps
counter-productive. In the long run, really significant improvement couldn&#39;t
occur, according to Malthus. It might even be self-defeating, leading to
disease, starvation and war, those great positive checks on population
increase. That idea of the limited nature of possible improvement was in Chadwick&#39;s
mind; the poor will always be with us. </p>
<p>There was also, as I
said, the filth theory of disease. We know it. We&#39;ve talked about miasma and
its long history in European thought. Well, filth now was associated very
closely with smell. And if you are to read the report at some point, you would
notice that smells constitute an important part of the report. The report is
filled with descriptions of stench. The authorities consulted by Chadwick
frequently used phrases such as, &quot;I was assailed by a most disagreeable
smell, and it was clear to me that the air was full of most injurious
malaria.&quot; By malaria, that&#39;s another word that occurs throughout the
report. And we should note that before malaria came to mean a specific
disease, it meant &quot;bad air,&quot; from the Italian <i>mal&#39; aria</i>, bad air. </p>
<p>And, so, this report,
in Britain in the 1840s, is filled with descriptions of what they called
malaria. Let me give you an example from the town in the West Country of
Truro. Reporting to Chadwick, the reporting official said, &quot;Passing into
St. Mary&#39;s Parish, the proportion of sickness and deaths is as great as any
part of Truro. But there&#39;s no mystery at all in the causation.
Ill-constructed houses with decomposing refuse, clothes upon their doors and windows,
open drains, bring the oozings of pigsties and filth to stagnate at the foot of
the walls. Such are a few of the sources of disease, which even the breezes
from the hills cannot dissipate.&quot; </p>
<p>Everywhere the
reports discovered disease, and they correlated the disease with such findings
as poisonous vapor, morbific effluvia, filth, obnoxious effluvia, poisonous
exhalations, miasma and malaria. The moral of the texts of those conditions
also preoccupied those who took part in the report. Vice, alcohol, intemperance,
and then more poverty, and still worse, more filth. Poverty was partly the
result of depravity and improvidence, and those in turn reinforced more poverty
and more filth. </p>
<p>Well, there was a
political aim behind the sanitary reform, and I think we might call this a
transformation that Chadwick was aiming at in the demographic composition of
the British population. In Chadwick&#39;s mind, trade unions, which he abhorred,
demonstrations, strikes, the Chartist Movement, and all the rest, were called by
Chadwick &quot;wild and dangerous assemblages.&quot; But he noted that they
were mainly led by the young. Older, experienced workmen, with family
responsibilities, he found to be moderate and temperate, and not to take part
in strikes and social unrest. Therefore a high early death rate, and poor
sanitary conditions, were actually politically destabilizing, at least in his
mind, because they led to the early death of workmen, and hence to an
overrepresentation of the dangerous young, and an under-representation of
moderating older workmen. </p>
<p>If we want to
understand and explain this view, perhaps we could invoke an anachronism, to
make an analogy. And we could use the analogy of a nuclear reactor, and
compare social unrest to a meltdown of the reactor core, with disastrous
consequences. Well, in terms of the reactor, to prevent such events reactors
make use, as you know, of boron control rods that are inserted to control the
rate of fission of uranium and plutonium, and to limit chain reactions. In
this way, what Chadwick wanted to do, by analogy, was to use older people like
control rods that would have the calming effect of preventing social meltdown
and social revolution. But to do that you had to do something about infectious
diseases, to achieve this demographic transformation of the population. </p>
<p>So, if infectious
disease was destabilizing for the state and political order, a population
subject to infectious disease moreover is unlikely to be educated and to be
open to the moral influence of the clergy. And the absence of cleansing in
towns, Chadwick felt, would lead also to demoralization and further depravity.
Now, in all of this thinking, let&#39;s remember too at what was lost. A striking
feature of Chadwick&#39;s view was the narrowness of its focus. The cause of ill
health in Victorian Britain--I think we should say not the cause--the causes
were undoubtedly multiple, and one could think about low wages, unregulated
factories, inadequate diet, poor clothing, lack of education, working
conditions in sweatshops, mines and factories, child labor, overcrowded
housing. These I would call social and economic determinants of disease. And
there were voices, particularly on the continent, for an alternative public
health that would address precisely such broad interests. </p>
<p>There was an older
tradition of what was called a &quot;medical police&quot; on the continent, and
a current of thought of what was called &quot;social medicine&quot;, whose most
prominent figure was this man, Rudolph Virchow, a Prussian physician who lived
from 1821 to 1902, and was one of the great figures of nineteenth century
medicine; a physician, anthropologist, biologist and radical politician. Now,
his view was that disease was not simply a biological event, but a socially
driven phenomenon. And his meaning of the term &quot;social medicine&quot; was
that physicians should treat not just individual patients but entire societies,
and that they should pay great attention to matters of the economy, to diet,
wages, housing, child labor, working conditions. </p>
<p>Virchow was, in a
sense, the anti-Chadwick. Chadwick&#39;s intention instead was to focus on the
narrow issue of filth and water, and his attention was confined to the working
classes and the filth in which they lived. At stake was the issue of how broad
should a public health movement be? And perhaps one could say that one of the
sad features of the period was the triumph of the narrowest gauge vision of
public health. The solution, in Chadwick&#39;s hands--and this was a major event
in public health, there&#39;s no doubt about it. I&#39;m trying to say--not that this
was unfortunate--it was only unfortunately narrow. Chadwick&#39;s solution
involved technological measures, all good in themselves: drains, sewers, water
pipes. But they didn&#39;t include social, economic and educational reform. And
the reforms all came from above, and reinforced a centralizing state, rather
than finding ways to empower ordinary people to participate in defending their
own health. </p>
<p>Let me give you an
example of a simple technological improvement. It might be hard to recognize
when you first look at it but--and I&#39;m talking about some very humble movements
that have enormous political and medical consequences. What we&#39;re looking at
is a sewer main, and these were established under the soil of cities in this
period, and one of the technological inventions was to make the sewers egg
shaped, so that you would maximize the flow and they would be self-cleaning and
they would drain most efficiently. So, technological innovations of that sort
were part of it. </p>
<p>Now, the victory of
Chadwick&#39;s vision of public health wasn&#39;t simply automatic, and so it was worth
to keep alternatives in mind. His side was the winning side in a debate of the
early nineteenth century, and a wider view, like that of Virchow, was present,
but lost the debate. Let&#39;s be clear in summation. I&#39;d argue that Chadwick&#39;s
vision of public health was highly successful, that it was a crucial part of
the mortality revolution of nineteenth century Europe, but that at the same
time something was lost, a broad vision of the causes of disease, and those
causes weren&#39;t addressed. </p>
<p>Although what
Chadwick achieved was a major and positive advance, it perhaps fell short of
what might have been, and it demonstrates the practical and positive impact of
miasmatic theory. And public health, a theory--and this is perhaps something
we ought to bear in mind--that a theory that is by now rejected--that is
miasmatism, the filth theory of disease--did operate in such a way as to
promote major and positive health results. And one of the causes of this
movement was the epidemic disease that we dealt with the last couple of times,
and that is Asiatic cholera. We might note there was a sidelight that may be
of interest as well; that this sanitary movement, the literal sanitary
movement, was accompanied in some places by what we might call a figurative
sanitary movement, and that is moral sanitation. And one of those was
particularly notable in France where there was a great fear of another disease,
that we&#39;ll be talking about slightly later in the course, and that is
syphilis. </p>
<p>Remember, the early
nineteenth century, we&#39;re dealing with the period in the wake of the Napoleonic
wars. And with those wars, as always happens--or happened--there was a major
upsurge in socially transmitted diseases, and in particular syphilis. And so
this sanitary movement was accompanied by the movement for moral sanitation
through the registration and surveillance of prostitutes. And in France those
responsible for moral sanitation actually made the link explicit; that is to
say that they compared brothels with sewers, and said that they, the brothels,
should become the target of sanitation. So this was a form of moral sanitation
that was an offshoot of the literal sanitary movement that is our main theme. </p>
<p>The sanitary
worldview led also on the continent to further offshoots, and that--I want to
talk now about a continental form of the sanitary movement, the rebuilding of
cities in their entirety. This was actually much more comprehensive and
systematic. It means urban planning. It&#39;s more comprehensive than what
happened in Britain, which was the retrofitting of cities with sewers and
drains and sanitary provisions. It entailed the actual leveling of whole
cities, or neighborhoods within them, to start afresh, in accordance with a
comprehensive plan. </p>
<p>There were a number
of prototypes. In France, Paris, Lyon and Marseilles. In Belgium, Brussels.
In Naples--that is in Italy, there was Naples, as you know, but also Florence,
La Spezia, and other places. But let&#39;s begin in Paris, because that
established the pattern. Here again we see the influence of epidemic cholera,
which ravaged Paris in the 1830s and again in 1849. And this caused an
enormous psychological shock, the idea that civilization was no sure-fire
protection against sudden and agonizing disease. There was an unbearable
contradiction that a city, that is Paris, that prided itself at being at the
heart of European intellectual life, at being the leading city in the arts and
culture, a world center, as you now know, of scientific medicine, could
nevertheless be devastated by a disease that was associated with poverty, with
filth, and with the colonial world. </p>
<p>Well, after the
revolutions of 1848 to &#39;49, we have a reactionary and authoritarian regime
established by Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, or Napoleon III, that soon became the
Second Empire, that lasted from 1851 &#39;til 1870. There&#39;s Napoleon III. He
undertook a major movement to rebuild Paris. And I want to argue that this had
enormous sanitary consequences, intentionally so, and that the experience of
epidemic cholera was very important in the establishment of that. But I don&#39;t
want to say that the rebuilding of Paris was solely designed as a health
measure, and solely to prevent the return of cholera. There were other gains
as well. </p>
<p>Napoleon III wanted
imperial splendor. He wanted a city that would be worthy of the role of France
in the world, that would be a showcase for his new political regime. He too
was thinking about social control. So, there was a political aim; that was, to
destroy the working class slums that had been the sites of rebellion. The idea
was to use urban renewal to remove workers from the center of the city to
distant suburbs, and in the center to construct wide boulevards that could not
be defended by barricades, and that the troops could use to move quickly across
the cities, and cannonballs could fire down the boulevards to demolish
barricades. In other words, Paris was to be made revolution-proof, or at least
that was the goal. </p>
<p>It was also a project
of public works; that is, it was a means of enormous patronage. It would
provide employment and would defuse social tensions as well. So, Paris, under
Napoleon III, became a vast public works project, enormous shovel-ready
projects. The workers of Paris then would be employed and therefore largely
pacified. It was thought that this would also have an economic role. The new
boulevards, the wide spaces, would facilitate the movement of goods and assist
free trade and commerce. And then there was the public health objective: to
improve health, to prevent the return of infectious epidemics. </p>
<p>The task was
entrusted to this man, Georges Haussmann, the Prefect of the Seine. And often
what was accomplished is referred to as the &quot;Haussmannization&quot; of Paris, with
the so-called great works, or <i>grands travaux</i>, that were undertaken from
1852 until 1870. Now, this project was authoritarian. The rights of
individuals were disregarded. The population was not consulted about being
moved, and it was an operation of colossal complexity. All of the affairs of
one of the greatest cities in France, the great city in France, were gathered
into a single pair of hands: finance, administration, transport, sanitation,
engineering, architecture, evictions, expropriation of land by eminent domain,
slum clearance, gas fixtures and lighting, sewers. All of this was an enormous
assertion, then, of state power. The means were broad intersecting
boulevards. </p>
<p>Let me show you the
sorts of plans--were to have the great boulevards of Paris, that you can see
today--such as the Rue de Rivoli, Boulevard de Strasbourg, Sébastopol, the
Boulevard Saint-Michel. The average size width of a street in Paris was to be
doubled, and underneath the streets there were to be sewers and drains. There
was to be water supply, and there were to be broad parks and public spaces,
such as the Bois de Boulogne. The aesthetics were the aesthetics of the
straight line. We can see that there. We can see it also here. And you can
see the intersection of these broad boulevards, and you can see how these were
multi-purpose and would allow not only--part of the idea was the miasmatic one,
that they would allow air and light to sweep through the city and remove the
noxious smells, and purify and cleanse the city. And you can see as well that
they would be good for commerce and for social control. </p>
<p>So, Paris, after
Haussmann, was clearly much healthier as a city than before, and cholera did
not return thereafter to the city center. But there is an irony here, that
cholera did return, less vehemently than before. But in the 1890s it did
return, but not to the center of the city. In other words, part of the
sanitary problem of Paris was not entirely solved, but was exported to the
suburbs, and it was the suburbs that experienced the return of cholera in
1892. We have to see this as an enormous sanitary success, but one that we
ought to qualify. Let me look at--let&#39;s look--this is a map--a picture of the
demolition, to convince you of what a major undertaking this was. And there&#39;s
a view of the new open spaces, cleansed with light and air, and germ free. And
also in Napoleon III&#39;s mind, it would be also--make revolution much more
difficult. Well there was--the political success, as well as the sanitary--was
a success but one that needs to be qualified. </p>
<p>There was an enormous
resentment among the working people of Paris at Haussmann&#39;s project, and there
was an enormous history from that time down to nearly our own of hostility of
the suburbs. Paris becomes, not by chance, surrounded by a red belt of
concluding hostility to the regime, and this exploded in the spring of 1871 in
the Paris Commune that brought down the regime and led to the establishment of
a republic. So, there are also political qualifications. Well, I&#39;ll move then
to another example very quickly, and one that is in the reading, and that is
the Italian version, and in particular the <i>risanamento</i> of Naples, which
was Italy&#39;s largest city. </p>
<p>As you know, there
was a massive epidemic in the city--this is the plan of <i>risanamento</i> in
Naples--and as you know, it led to the idea--and here is something that is
actually unique; that is to say that we&#39;ve talked about the retrofitting of
British cities and also American ones. We&#39;ve talked about the rebuilding of
Paris. Those were associated with a variety of disease experiences, and they
had purposes other than a single disease. One can&#39;t see the retrofitting of
British cities as due solely to epidemic cholera, nor the rebuilding of Paris.
Here in Naples we have something that&#39;s unusual and probably unique, which is
the actual rebuilding of a major European city for the specific purpose of
preventing the return of cholera. And the way that the plan was developed
reflected the specific medical understanding of the time of the cause of
cholera. And we see here too a form of the filth theory of disease. </p>
<p>The rebuilding of Naples
was for this single purpose, and the medical theory behind the rebuilding
project was specifically the miasmatic theory of this physician from Bavaria,
Munich in particular, who is Max von Pettenkofer, who had an enormous influence
on public health. And one aspect of his influence was that his theory lay at
the basis of the rebuilding of Naples. He developed the most sophisticated of
miasmatic theories in the nineteenth century and was aimed--the aim then behind
the rebuilding of Naples was to thin out the population. Overcrowding was a
cause of disease, and poisonous vapors arising from underneath the city
poisoned the air, people breathed in the poison and succumbed to cholera, in
Max Pettenkofer&#39;s view. </p>
<p>The purpose of <i>risanamento</i>
then was first of all to raise the level of the streets; that is to say, the
danger and the miasma was, if we like, fermenting beneath the streets of the
city. So, you want to place a greater distance between the population living
above and the poisonous effluvia arising from below. And, so, the aspiration
was to raise the level of the streets to the second storey of the houses. And
there would be, if you like, then a massive cushion, including the mortar of
the streets themselves, between the population of the city and the danger
lurking in the groundwater beneath the soil. </p>
<p>In addition, the idea
was that you would have Naples--there&#39;s a picture of the old city that&#39;s--in
various aspects--that&#39;s been demolished; and here what I wanted to show was
this, the great access at the center; and then there were various cross
streets. The great boulevard at the center was in the direction of the
prevailing wind, and it was called a bellows of fresh air that would allow the
wind to rush through the city, drying up the effluvia and blowing away the
stenches and allowing the sunlight to reach ground level, and then it would be
crossed by a series of wide boulevards as well. And then under the--if this
happened above ground, there would also be work going on beneath, and you would
have a whole sewage mains being built under the city. </p>
<p>So, <i>risanamento</i>,
this enormous project, both above and below ground, was related-- it was a
cousin of the sanitary movement in Britain. It was a first-cousin of the
rebuilding of Paris and Lyon. But it was distinctive too, because it&#39;s the
only example of a project conducted exclusively for the purpose of defeating a
single disease, and that was cholera. Was it a success? Well, Naples was
rebuilt. And there&#39;s no doubt that the health of the city thereafter was
greater than it had been before. But unfortunately there too there were
qualifications. The rebuilding was marred, marred perhaps partly by the flaws
in its conception from the outset, but marred also by the fact of corruption
and the misuse of the funds that were used to carry it out. </p>
<p>And, so, we see
thereafter that although Naples was rebuilt in the aftermath of 1884, that
there was a return of cholera, a major epidemic again, in 1911. And there was
even a small coda to that, which is another outbreak, even in 1973. So, the
irony and conclusion. The sanitary movement in Britain, retrofitting of
cities, the rebuilding of cities in France, the <i>risanamento</i> in Naples,
did achieve major success. But it&#39;s worth remembering that they often weren&#39;t
based on a medical theory that was to endure. And indeed in the case of
Naples, it was a medical theory that very soon after the rebuilding was to be
discarded. </p>
<p>No sooner had Naples
been rebuilt than the theories of Pettenkofer were overturned, with the coming
of the germ theory of disease. So, when we&#39;re--one of the questions we ask,
then, was the lasting impact of epidemic diseases. And I would argue that one
of the senses of lasting impact is one that&#39;s embodied in bricks and mortar, in
urban planning. And if you visit these cities, then you can see the lasting
legacy of epidemic disease in the urban landscape itself. </p>
