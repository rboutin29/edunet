<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden: </b>I
want to turn to the next topic, which marks a new unit in our course. That is
to say, until now we&#39;ve dealt with bubonic plague, in a series of talks and in
your first section meeting. Now I&#39;d like to look, for comparative purposes, at
a very different high-impact disease; and this time and next we&#39;ll be dealing
with smallpox. So, I think you deserve an answer to the obvious questions: why
smallpox, and why at this stage in the course? So, I want to give you a little
bit of explanation, to see where we&#39;re going. The first has to do with I might
call a varied intellectual diet, and I want us to deal with diseases of very
different types, and so we&#39;ll have to examine the impact of different kinds of
infectious diseases. </p>
<p>Plague was a
bacterial disease. Smallpox instead is viral. Plague was transmitted by
vectors. You know the drill now, the role of rats and fleas. Smallpox instead
is spread by contact and airborne inhalation of droplets. Plague is a classic
epidemic disease, in the sense that it&#39;s an outside invader that ravages a
locality for a season and then departs. Smallpox is different in that it can
be both endemic and epidemic. So, we&#39;ll see a different dynamic. It&#39;s also
true that the social responses to smallpox were quite different. </p>
<p>Plague was associated
with terror and social disruption, and in the New World we&#39;ll see that it had
an even more dramatic impact on the Native--smallpox did--on the Native
American population. But in European conditions it was a familiar endemic
disease with a less dramatic--as a cause--was less dramatic as a cause of
social tensions and disruption. We&#39;ll see too that in terms of impact, for
chronology it makes sense to look at smallpox at this stage in our class. It
had long been present in human history, but there was an upsurge in smallpox in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that accompanied the surge in the
demography of Europe. And it also reflected the transformation of social and
economic conditions associated with the commercialization of agriculture, the
onset of industrial development, and rapid, unplanned urbanization, with those
associated pathologies such as overcrowding, both at home and in the workplace.</p>
<p>In those conditions,
smallpox was a great killer, and it succeeded plague as the most dreaded
disease of the late-seventeenth and the eighteenth century. In a sense, we&#39;re
moving from bubonic plague, the most dreaded disease of its era, to--in a
sense, in terms of fear--to smallpox as the next most dreaded disease of the
next period in the eighteenth century. But there&#39;s more to it that that.
Smallpox, as you&#39;ll see in our reading and in our lecture next time, was also
extraordinarily important in terms of its impact in the New World. It led to a
demographic catastrophe for the Native American population, largely
spontaneously, but there were also intentional acts of genocide involved. </p>
<p>So, we&#39;re going to
see, in terms of one of the themes of our course, that disease, and
particularly smallpox, played an important role in the big picture of history;
in conditioning or creating factors that were important in European settlement
in the New World, and that led to the introduction of African slavery, as the
Native American population had no immunity and perished from smallpox, and
therefore could not be enslaved; whereas Africans, possessing immunity, were
imported to replace them. </p>
<p>Another major feature
and reason for dealing with smallpox has to do with another theme of our
course, and that is public health. We&#39;ve already dealt with plague measures of
public health. You know what they are, the plague measures: boards of health,
quarantine, lazarettos, sanitary cordons, emergency burial regulations.
Smallpox, by contrast, was to lead to a very different but highly effective
style of public health; that is, first inoculation and then vaccination,
associated with Edward Jenner. Even more spectacularly than plague measures,
vaccination ultimately promoted a victory over smallpox, leading in 1980 to its
total global eradication, at least naturally occurring smallpox; the first, and
still as we speak, the only human disease to be so intentionally eradicated. </p>
<p>Unlike plague
measures, vaccination was a powerful tool of public health. Successful
vaccines have subsequently been developed against other diseases: measles,
rubella, whooping cough, tetanus, diphtheria, rabies, polio. But again, like
plague measures, vaccines have been controversial--and we&#39;ll be talking about
when vaccines form an appropriate strategy--and eradication has been ever more
elusive for diseases other than smallpox. It may be that smallpox is a special
case, rather than, as many hoped, a model for the eradication of diseases
sequentially, one after another. </p>
<p>We&#39;ll be looking also
at smallpox because of its demographic and economic effects. We talked, in
terms of plague, of a mortality revolution, in terms of demography, and also of
its impact on industrialization. Smallpox and the successful containment of
smallpox through inoculation and vaccination also had a major impact on that
mortality revolution, and therefore also on economic development. We&#39;ll be
looking also at cultural impact, and we&#39;ll see that smallpox also produced the
cult of certain new saints; that it too became a theme in the arts and
literature. </p>
<p>More speculatively,
we talked last time about the possible relationship of the successful conquest
of plague on the coming of the Enlightenment. Well, smallpox provides us with
a second instance of the successful deployment of human means to control a
major cause of death and anguish, making life more secure and longer. It&#39;s
suggested that a number of leading <i>philosophes</i> were avid proponents of
inoculation, including Voltaire and Condorcet. So, we&#39;ll be dealing with those
issues. But this morning what I&#39;d like to do is to concentrate on something
more narrow, which is--but forms the basis for our understanding of the impact
of this disease--its nature as a disease. How it affects the individual human
body, and what were the treatments in the seventeenth, eighteenth centuries. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s begin with
smallpox as a disease. Smallpox, often nicknamed, for reasons we&#39;ll soon see,
&quot;the speckled monster.&quot; It&#39;s a virus belonging to the family of
orthopox viruses that includes <i>Variola major</i>, <i>Variola minor</i> and cowpox.
We&#39;ll talk about cowpox next time, because of its influence in the development
of vaccination. But our theme will concern <i>Variola major</i> and <i>Variola
minor</i>; especially <i>Variola major</i>, which is the causative agent,
primarily, of smallpox. This is a picture of <i>Variola major</i>, the largest
of all viruses, first seen by the microscope in 1905. This causes classical
smallpox. There&#39;s <i>Variola minor</i> as well, that first appeared in the
twentieth century; and for our purposes we can afford to ignore it. It was of
minor impact and now, like <i>Variola major</i>, it&#39;s extinct as well. </p>
<p>Now, one question is,
what&#39;s a virus? We talked about the term microbe; microbe being a generic term
for microscopic organisms, including bacteria, like our friend <i>Yersinia
pestis</i>, the causative agent of bubonic plague, and viruses like <i>Variola
major</i> and <i>Variola minor</i>, the pathogens that cause smallpox. Plague
was caused by bacteria, and those, as you know--and will be studying more on Science
Hill--are unicellular organisms that are definitely and unequivocally alive.
They reproduce by dividing. They contain DNA, plus all the cellular machinery
necessary to read it, and to produce the many proteins that enable it to live
and reproduce. Viruses are something different. And here there&#39;s a possible
confusion lurking for the historian. </p>
<p>The word &quot;virus&quot;
itself is ancient. In the humoral system, in fact, when diseases were seen to
arise from assaults on the body on the outside, one of the major environmental
insults that was thought to lead to disease was the corrupted air or miasma,
and this was influenced by a poison, that might be called a virus. So, if you
do research on medical history, you&#39;ll see the term &quot;virus&quot; used in an old
sense for many centuries. But &quot;virus&quot; in present medical discourse is a term
that dates its modern usage from the early twentieth century, and it refers to
parasitic particles, perhaps 500 times smaller than bacteria. Their existence
was established by elegant scientific experiments in the first years of the
century, completed by about 1903. But they couldn&#39;t actually be seen until the
invention of electron microscope in the 1930s, and their functioning wasn&#39;t
understood until the DNA revolution of the 1950s. </p>
<p>So, viruses, we now
know, consist of some of the elements of life, stripped to their most basic. A
virus really is nothing more than a piece of genetic material wrapped in a
protein case. They&#39;re particles that are inert on their own. Viruses lack the
machinery to read DNA, or to make proteins, or carry out metabolic processes.
They can do nothing on their own, and they cannot reproduce by themselves.
Their survival depends instead on invading living cells. Once inside, they
highjack the cell and its machinery. The genetic code of the virus--and the
virus, after all, is almost nothing else--gives the cell the message it needs
to reproduce more virus, thus transforming cells into virus producing
factories, and in the process they destroy the host cell. As they produce more
and more viruses, and destroy more and more cells, the effect on the human body
can be severe, even catastrophic, depending on the capacity of the immune
system to contain or destroy the invasion. </p>
<p>Here we have, in a
sense, the opposite of a Hippocratic idea of disease; the body assaulted, not
from the outside, but rather from a parasitic pathogen deep within. There is
an exotic debate, of course--are viruses alive? Those who argue that they are
alive, note that they&#39;re capable of transmitting genetic material, one of the
key indications of life. Those who claim they&#39;re not alive, note that on their
own they&#39;re inert, that they can&#39;t carry on metabolic processes, or produce
proteins. Viruses, they note, are the ultimate parasites. Virologists often
say that whether you decide that viruses are alive or not is ultimately a
matter or disciplinary perspective, or perhaps even personal preference. The
reassuring point for us is that, perhaps excepting theology, the answer doesn&#39;t
really matter. </p>
<p>In any case, what we
need to know is that smallpox was caused by a virus, and a virus that has no
animal reservoir. The disease was restricted entirely to human beings, and
that will prove to be important in making it eventually a good candidate for
eradication. The name for the virus, <i>Variola</i>, derives from the Latin <i>varius</i>,
meaning spotted. And in England the disease, in fact, was popularly called, as
I&#39;ve said, &quot;the speckled monster.&quot; So, here&#39;s a picture of the
smallpox virus--oops, it&#39;s gone out; there it is. And that&#39;s a schematic image
of a smallpox virus. And as I said, there is a mutation that occurred in the
twentieth century, causing the rise of <i>Variola minor</i>, as well as <i>Variola
major</i>. But we&#39;ll be concerned exclusively here with <i>Variola major</i>;
the main cause of smallpox historically.</p>
<p>Well, how was it
transmitted? Here we need to remember that smallpox is an exceedingly
contagious disease. A smallpox patient sheds millions of infective viruses
into his or her immediate surroundings, from the rash and from the open sores
in the sufferer&#39;s throat. The patient is infective from just before the onset
of the rash until the very last scab falls off weeks later. Not everyone, of
course, who is exposed is infected. Living along with people with
immunity--and leaving that aside--it has been estimated that the chances are
about 50:50 that a susceptible member of a household would contract smallpox
from an ill patient in the home. </p>
<p>The dominant manner
to spread smallpox was by contact infection, droplets breathed out in
face-to-face contact with a susceptible person and inhaled by that person.
Normally the spread was in the context of intense contact over a period of
time; that is, a family member, or someone on a hospital ward, in an enclosed
workplace--an office, a factory, a mine--a school classroom, an army barrack, a
refugee camp. And it&#39;s most easily transmitted in dry, cool seasons. That&#39;s
the primary mode of transmission. There are two more, however, that are more
relatively secondary. </p>
<p>A second mode of
transmission is by what are called--another bit of jargon here--fomites. A
fomite is simply an inanimate object, capable of carrying infectious material
from one person to another. Examples might be bed linen, clothing; the shroud
from an infected person that transmits viruses from one body--that is, of the
sufferer--to the next person. Other examples are simply doorknobs, eating
utensils, and so on. So, that&#39;s a second mode of transmission. There&#39;s a
third too, that smallpox can be vertically transmitted; that is, from mother to
infant. It&#39;s possible for an infant to be born with congenital smallpox.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s the mode
of transmission. What about its epidemiology? Well, some favoring factors
include large urban populations. It&#39;s not coincidental that smallpox raged in
Western Europe in the eighteenth century. The crowded living conditions and
workplaces were ideal for its transmission. Trade and the movement of people,
displaced people, warfare. People who assembled and reassembled in crowds were
ideal for transmitting smallpox. The disease is known to have afflicted
Ancient Egypt. Mummies are known to have been victims of smallpox. But the
important point is that it became endemic in Europe, that became the world
reservoir of infection, from which it spread by trade, colonization, warfare.
And in European cities it became, above all, a disease of childhood. But about
a third of the deaths of children in the seventeenth century were due to
smallpox. </p>
<p>So, a reason then for
dealing with smallpox now, in our course, is that it was on a major upsurge in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. How was it named? Why is it called
smallpox? A small point. But we need to know that it&#39;s from a comparative
description of its characteristic lesions. The &quot;great pox&quot; is a
disease which we&#39;ll be dealing with pretty soon, which was syphilis, that
creates large lesions and affects adults. The smallpox had small lesions and
primarily affected children; at least in countries in which it was endemic. </p>
<p>Another point we
should know about smallpox is that after infection, a person enjoys a lifelong
immunity. We need to know that because it&#39;s a major factor in the public
health measures that the disease eventually generated. Well, what about its
symptoms? How does it affect the individual human body? After inhaling the
virus, there&#39;s an incubation period, which normally lasts something like twelve
days. This is important in its epidemiology because it allowed the spread of
the disease; because an infected person had ample time to travel before falling
ill, and therefore time to take the disease with him or her and to spread it. </p>
<p>Now, I&#39;m going to
give some attention--perhaps more than you might like when you see the
images--to the symptoms of smallpox. And there&#39;s a reason for that. Part is
that smallpox is tremendously, terribly, terrifyingly painful. Plus it
leads--and this is important too, in the way that it impacted society--it often
produces lifelong scarring, disfiguring and blindness, and these in turn spread
fear of it and terror. And, so, the very word smallpox has a particular
resonance in popular imagination, associated with dread. </p>
<p>People sometimes ask,
in a course like this, which of the diseases we encounter was really the
worst? The question doesn&#39;t permit empirical verification, because no one has
ever suffered, mercifully, all the afflictions we study and had the opportunity
to compare. But it is meaningful to note the impression of those who lived
through the times when smallpox claimed its legions of victims. They
thought--and the physicians who treated them--that smallpox was the worst of
human maladies; that was a term that was said at the time. And this, in fact,
was the view, closer to home, of the Illinois State Board of Health in 1902,
where Dr. Donald Hopkins wrote this: &quot;In the suddenness and
unpredictability of its attack, in the grotesque torture of its victims, in the
brutality of its lethal or disfiguring outcome, and in the dread that it
inspired, smallpox is the worst. It&#39;s unique among human diseases.&quot; To
the extent that that&#39;s true, it&#39;s also one of the reasons that smallpox appeals
to the malevolent as a possible instrument of bioterror. </p>
<p>It&#39;s well-known that
a major outbreak of smallpox would spread death, maximize suffering, and lead
to widespread fear, flight and social disruption. The symptoms are important
to examine as an integral part of this disease. And more generally, unless we
appreciate the distinctive symptoms of each of the diseases we examine, there&#39;s
a distorting temptation to allow them to run together, the diseases, as so many
interchangeable causes of death; a point of view that prevents us from understanding
that each of these epidemic diseases had a distinctive and different imprint. </p>
<p>Smallpox was the
disease that it was, in part because of the dread that it generated; fear not
only of death, but also of exquisite suffering, maiming, disfiguring and blindness.
Only with that in mind, can we understand why it&#39;s also so widely thought to be
a candidate for bioterror. So, we&#39;ll look at images of the disease. And I
apologize to those of you who&#39;ve just finished breakfast or just about to have
lunch. In any case, first after the incubation period, there&#39;s the
pre-eruptive stage. The virus multiplies in the system for twelve days after
incubation, and symptoms of disease begin with a viral shower, as the pathogen
is released into the bloodstream and spreads systemically throughout the body,
localizing eventually in the blood vessels of the skin, just below the
superficial layers. The viral load released, and the efficiency of the body&#39;s
immune response, determine the severity and type of the disease. Onset is
sudden, with fever of 100 to 102 degrees, and a general malaise. </p>
<p>This, then, is the
beginning of perhaps a month of excruciating suffering and the danger of
spreading contagion. The early symptoms are fever, vomiting, severe backache,
splitting frontal headache, and in children sometimes convulsions. Sometimes
the disease is so overwhelming that it leads to what&#39;s called fulminating
smallpox, which causes death within thirty-six hours, with no outward
manifestations at all; although post-mortem exams reveal hemorrhages in the
respiratory tract, the alimentary tract or the heart muscles. </p>
<p>Let me give you a
description of a hyper-acute case of that kind. Physicians wrote: &quot;After
three to four days, the patient has the general aspect of someone who&#39;s passed
through a long and exhausting struggle. His face has lost all expression, is
mask-like, and there&#39;s a wont of tone in all muscles. When he speaks, this
condition becomes more apparent, speaking as with evident effort, and the voice
is low and monotonous. The patient is listless and indifferent to
surroundings. The mental attitude is similar. There&#39;s a loss of tension, a
lengthening of reaction time, and defective control. In the most fulminant
cases, the aspect of the patient resembles that of someone suffering from
severe shock and loss of blood. The face is drawn and pallid. Respiration is
sighing or gasping. The patient tosses about continually, and cries out. His
attention is fixed with difficulty, and he complains only of agonizing pain;
now in the chest, now in the back, the head or the abdomen.&quot; </p>
<p>But normally smallpox
wasn&#39;t fulminant quite like that, and the patient passed on to the next phase,
which was the eruptive one, exhibiting the classical symptoms of smallpox that
led to its diagnosis. On the third day after onset, the patient usually felt a
little better, and in mild cases he or she could return to normal activities,
with the unfortunate effect that this spread the disease further. But
concurrently a rash appeared; a small round or oval, rose-colored lesion, known
as a macule, that&#39;s up to a quarter-of-an-inch in diameter. The macules
appeared first on the tongue and palate, and then, within twenty-four hours, it
spread to cover the body, down to the palms of the hands and soles of the
feet. On the cheek and forehead, the appearance is of severe sunburn, and
indeed the sensation felt by the patient is of scalding pain or intense
burning. There&#39;s a characteristic pattern, called centrifugal distribution;
that is, that the rash is least spread on the trunk of the body and most
densely apparent on the face and the extremities. </p>
<p>Let me show you a
slide of a very ill little boy, and you can see this centrifugal pattern in
which the rash is most apparent on the extremities, rather than the trunk. On
day two of the rash, a little further into the infection, the lesions alter.
At this time the macule becomes harder, and generally rises above the surface
into structures known as papules, with a flattened apex. To the touch, they
were said, by physicians, to feel like buckshot embodied in the skin. And
there we can see the picture of a face, at that stage of the disease. The
disease then moves on, by the fifth day of the rash, when fluid begins to
accumulate in pockmarks, which are then raised and firm to the touch--so we&#39;ll
pass on--now called vesicles. They&#39;ve grown in size. They&#39;ve changed in color
from red to bluish or purple. And they&#39;ve transformed from solid to
blister-like fluid. It&#39;s umbilicated as well.</p>
<p>The process of what&#39;s
called vesiculation, the rise of this stage of the rash, takes about three days
and lasts a further three. It&#39;s at this stage that the physical diagnosis of
smallpox becomes reliable, with the disease presenting its most distinctive
appearance. The patient experiences increasing difficulty in swallowing and in
talking, due to extensive lesions in the mucous membranes in the palate and the
throat. And there&#39;s a child at this stage of the disease. Then by the sixth
day of the rash, pus begins to form in the pockmarks. The patient feels much
worse. Septicemia can set in. The pustules, as they&#39;re now called, begin to
fill with yellow fluid, and the lesions become globular in shape; a process
that takes about two days, and they&#39;re fully matured on the eighth day of the
eruptive phase. </p>
<p>The patient feels
dreadful at this point. Fever has risen in proportion to the severity of the
attack. The eyelids, lips, nose and tongue are tremendously swollen. And we
can see a picture of an adult at that phase of the infection. At this point,
the patient is almost totally unable to swallow or talk, and deteriorates
slowly, being drowsy most of the time and restless at night. Often he or she
is in a condition of delirium, and thrashes about; may even try to escape. The
psychological effects weren&#39;t simply a sign of high fever. They resulted also
from the involvement of the central nervous system in the infection, and the
neurological effects and sequelae could often be lasting and result in
long-term impairment. </p>
<p>Then, by the ninth
day of the rash, the pustules were firm and embedded in the skin, and for this
reason were likely--and this was important in the impact of the disease--to
leave permanent scars and deep pits on the face, or wherever they appeared on
the body; if you can imagine by at this stage. Another unpleasant aspect at
this stage was that a terrible sickly smell developed, the fetor of smallpox,
that physicians claimed that it was impossible to describe but was found to be
overpowering. It&#39;s now nearly impossible for the patient to drink, and even
milk caused intense burning sensations in the throat. The patient experiences
great loss in weight--as much as thirty to forty pounds in an adult--and may
suffer from frank starvation. In addition, there&#39;s a complete loss of muscle
tone, while the face, in severe cases, takes on the appearance of a cadaver,
making the patient almost unrecognizable, even to his or her closest
relatives. The scalp may be one large lesion, and tangled with hair. And
lesions, as you can imagine, under the nails of fingers and toes were
exquisitely painful. </p>
<p>I want to show
another disturbing image--this was important, but you can look away if you
like--which was the lesions of the eyes. Because smallpox was a major cause of
blindness, as well as death and disfigurement, in this period. Well, after
about ten to fourteen days of rash, scabs appear, and these contain live
smallpox virus as well, and are highly infective and important in the spread of
the disease by fomites. At this point, the fluid portion of the pustule is
absorbed, leaving behind the solid part. Large areas of the skin may begin to
peel off, leaving deeper tissues raw and exposed. These areas are all painful,
and contribute to the frightening appearance and the misery of the patient.
Fatal cases often occurred from about the eighth day, and an important reason
was toxemia, because these lesions were susceptible to infection. So,
attentive nursing, good hygiene and sound nutrition reduced the likelihood of
that sort of complication. And, to that degree at least, the prosperous, the
well-nursed and well-cared for were more likely to survive. </p>
<p>The appearance of the
patient was often described by physicians as mortification; the still living
patient taking on the appearance of being mummified, and the skin of the face
fixed in a grotesque mask, with the mouth permanently open. The appearance of
scabs and crusting though was a favorable sign in terms of prognosis for the
patient. But they did lead to one final torment of the disease, which was an
intolerable itching that accompanied that period; indeed, a large portion of
the scarring that resulted from smallpox was undoubtedly due to patients
scratching and tearing at their lesions. </p>
<p>Well, the appearance
and distribution of the pustules was of major importance for diagnosis, and it
could be what was called &quot;discrete smallpox,&quot; where the rash
was--each lesion was distinct and separated from the next. And this meant that
you had a case fatality rate of as low as about nine percent; you had a ninety
percent chance of survival. If instead the lesions were much closer
together--semi-confluent it was called--the case fatality rate rose to
something like thirty-seven percent. Or in cases of what was called
&quot;confluent smallpox,&quot; in which the lesions touched one another and
formed a network surrounded by islands of unaffected skin, the case fatality
rate was about sixty-five percent. So, the appearance of the lesions was very
important in your prognosis. </p>
<p>The rarest form was
hemorrhagic smallpox, which had a hundred percent mortality, so-called because
the natural clotting mechanisms of the blood were impaired, and the victim died
of massive internal hemorrhaging. Overall, the case fatality rate for smallpox
was estimated to be about thirty to forty percent. The virus then attacked not
only the skin and the throat, but also the lungs, the heart, the liver and
other internal organs, and could result in hemorrhaging and death. A major
danger was also secondary bacterial infection of the lesions; a very common
cause of mortality. Meanwhile, the lesions of the mouth and throat were of
great epidemiological importance, because they&#39;re the source of the viruses
that commonly form droplets in the air and infect others. Also, the tongue
became swollen and misshapen. There was difficulty breathing. The patient
became hoarse, swallowing was difficult. And all of that was important. </p>
<p>There were other
sources of anguish and suffering: blindness, scarring and disfigurement,
respiratory complications. But after the drying up of the rash, the patient
began to recover. And among the population that survived, the symptoms
declined and the patient regained strength and possessed a lifelong immunity
from a second exposure. All of this led, of course, as you can imagine, to
tremendous fear of the disease--as in this picture--of <i>Variola</i>. </p>
<p>Well, how did
physicians deal with this disease? Smallpox no longer occurs naturally
anywhere on the planet. But it&#39;s worth remembering that there is still no
specific remedy or cure for the disease. Treatment, should a case appear
today, would be largely supportive, depending above all on intensive nursing,
to keep the lesions scrupulously clean, to prevent bedsores and to minimize the
breakdown of the skin. In addition, modern medicine would replace lost fluids
and nutrients, and would administer antibiotics, not to deal with the virus,
but with the bacterial infections that are its complications. </p>
<p>What were traditional
remedies? Some of them were surprising. One was a great vogue in the color
red. There was a vogue to hang red curtains around the bed of a patient. Red
furniture was brought into the sickroom, and patients, including Queen
Elizabeth I of England, were wrapped in red blankets. Later on, the discovery
of ultraviolet rays in fact gave new impetus to this traditional mania for red,
and red glass went up on windows. In the late nineteenth century, medical
journals published studies suggesting also that red light could be soothing to
the eyes of the sufferer, and that perhaps it prevented scarring of the skin.
So, that was one factor. </p>
<p>Another idea that was
very common was to open the pustule with a golden needle, to drain the fluid,
and then sometimes the lesions were cauterized in an attempt to prevent
scarring; procedures that were exceedingly painful. The next idea was what was
called &quot;the hot regimen,&quot; to pile the sufferer with blankets, to
induce him or her to sweat profusely, to rid the body of the over-abundant
humor. Or the patient could be immersed in a hot bath. Light and fresh air,
according to this therapeutic fashion, were deemed to be harmful, and the
patient was kept in the dark, if possible, with minimal ventilation.</p>
<p>Sunlight was said to
aggravate the disease and increase scarring. And sometimes patients were given
internal medications, sudorifics, to help the evacuation of the excess humor.
The opposite was also tried, the so-called &quot;cold regimen,&quot; to keep
the room cool, and frequently to sponge down the patient with cold water, to
place-ice bags on the face. Then there was purging and bloodletting. There
was also the administration of opiates, in the nineteenth century, and
especially morphine, to calm the patient in delirium. Astringent eye drops
were resorted to. </p>
<p>A particularly
perverse theory, with no empirical basis, was the idea that scarring on the
face could be reduced or prevented by causing more intense irritation of the
skin elsewhere; so that mustard plasters, mercury and corrosives were applied
on the back, in order to save the face. There were also all kinds of local
applications to the face, to try to prevent scarring. Nitrate of silver,
mercury, iodine, mild acids, a lotion of sulfur; all of those had their
vogues. There were ointments and compresses of virtually every substance known
to man. Some physicians held the theory that their preparations would soften
the lesion and mitigate scarring. So, indeed, ingenious doctors applied lint,
boric acid or glycerin; or they covered the face with a mask, leaving holes for
the eyes, nose and mouth. Or they wrapped the face and hands in oiled silk. </p>

were administered to deteriorating patients to revive their energy. And
sometimes delirious patients were actually tied to their beds. Some doctors
recommended restraints, such as splints, in later stages, to prevent patients
from scarring their faces by scratching. After hearing of all of these
treatments for smallpox, perhaps you&#39;ll appreciate the work of Thomas Sydenham,
in the seventeenth century, the so-called English Hippocrates, who decided that
the wealthy and noble who received extensive attention and treatment for
smallpox perished of the disease more frequently than the poor, who had no
access to treatment. And his advice was that the best physician was the one
who did the least. He was an advocate of therapeutic minimalism. He advised
instead a simple cool regimen, giving his patients fresh air and light bed
coverings. </p>

disease afflicted the human body. What I want to do next time, now that we
understand this terrible disease and the suffering it caused, is to deal with
its impact historically, its effect on society, and to look at the development
of a public health strategy, which was to be vaccination.</p>
