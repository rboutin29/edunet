<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden: </b>Good
morning. We&#39;ll get started. As you know, this isn&#39;t--there isn&#39;t going to be
a lecture this morning at all. We&#39;re going instead to have a review session,
in which I&#39;ll be very much dependent on your having questions, and our having a
joint discussion. So, what I&#39;m expecting to be able to do is to, when you have
questions, or want to contribute to--I&#39;ve got some questions as well--we can
put our heads together. And there&#39;ll be a microphone, I hope, that we can pass
around, and everyone will be audible. </p>
<p>The first thing I
should say is just to talk, just for a minute, about the exam itself; because
I&#39;ve now written it. So, at least we can say on that much I&#39;m the world&#39;s
authority. The exam will look like this. There will be two parts. The first
part will be the ID section, and that will have--let&#39;s see, you&#39;ve got the list
of identifications, and I&#39;ve literally just chosen ten of them, and that will
constitute two points each, or a total of twenty points for the ID section.
And, so, you can work out how to budget your time, in that regard. Clearly,
you&#39;re not meant to write an essay; just even bullet points or a short
paragraph is all that&#39;s expected with regard to the identifications. </p>
<p>The second part of
the exam consists of three essays, and I&#39;m--that is, three on a list of
three--and I&#39;ll ask you to write on two of them. And each of the essays
therefore will count forty points. So, part two of the exam will count eighty
points altogether. That tells how you should budget your time. The essay
questions are much more important than the identifications. That&#39;s really the
structure of the exam. I can&#39;t think really of anything else that I can say
about that. But let me see if anyone--before we turn to substantive issues,
does anyone have any questions about the format of the exam or what&#39;s likely to
be on it?</p>
<p>I can repeat what
I&#39;ve said before. The exam period itself is notionally three hours, though you
also get an additional half-hour as a grace period. That, I understand, is the
Yale system, and we&#39;ll adhere to that. The exam will also--I wanted to stress
this--it will cover the whole of the course, from the beginning, and it won&#39;t simply
be on the last part of the course, since the mid-term. It will cover
everything that we&#39;ve dealt with since January down to today. So, are there
any questions before we turn to the substance, about the format of the exam, or
what you could expect or not expect, or anything of that nature? Yes? </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Do we need to bring
in any sort of readings on the ID section?</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
The question was, do you need to bring in readings on the ID section? I think
that depends entirely on which ID you deal with. Some of the IDs are directly
based on the reading that you&#39;ve done. So, for example, if I ask Daniel Defoe,
to identify, it would be really odd if you didn&#39;t bring in the <i>Journal of
the Plague Year</i>, and why it was important. Okay? But if I asked you about,
say, the Paris School of Medicine, that you didn&#39;t actually have readings on,
then it wouldn&#39;t be necessarily. So, it really depends on the nature of the
particular ID in question. Okay? </p>
<p>Anything else about
the exam? Okay, thanks. Then let&#39;s move on to the substantive part of the
review, and the issues that we&#39;ve been dealing with in the course. And I
thought one way we might start would be for me to ask you a question; which is
what do you think I should sensibly ask you about on the final? What would
make good final exam questions for you, based on the material that you&#39;ve
covered? And then we could put our heads together a little bit to think about
what might be some elements of the answers that you&#39;d provide in them. Does
anyone have a question that I ought to ask you? It&#39;s never too late; I could
change the questions I wrote yesterday. You think I should ask you nothing?
It&#39;s always a possibility, too. </p>
<p>Okay, well I&#39;ve got
some thoughts, if you like, for things that we might want to deal with. One
was this-- and I&#39;m going to ask and see if any of you would like to help me
think through this particular issue-- if we&#39;re dealing with the impact of major
epidemic diseases on society, what would be--is it true to think that it&#39;s
really the overall mortality that provides the major way in which we can assess
whether this was an important event or it wasn&#39;t? Is that how we judge the
significance of the passage of an epidemic disease through society? Do we--is
the body count, in other words, the most important factor? Or is it something
else? How do we--what factors determine whether an epidemic disease really is
a significant historical event or it isn&#39;t? Do you have any thoughts on that
particular issue? Yes--please? Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Morbidity.
&lt;Inaudible&gt;</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay, thanks very much. Did everyone hear? The candidate for an answer would
be that it&#39;s not just the mortality, but we need to look at the morbidity, and
even more than that we need to look at the class, or the profile of the victims
of the epidemic, and that it makes a big difference whether the victims of the
disease are the elderly, and perhaps infants; in other words, whether it seems
like a normal event in the life of that society, or whether it targets instead
a different patient population. If it targets people in the prime of life,
it&#39;s experienced in a very different way. So, clearly the class profile is
important, and not just the mortality, or even the morbidity. Are there other
factors? Yes? </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> One argument in
favor of mortality mattering is it didn&#39;t really have much of an impact on
things like society, and it didn&#39;t prove lasting. Like you could control
things. So you&#39;d have like a really big morbidity but a small mortality, and
so that prevented a panic.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
That&#39;s great. </p>
<p>&lt;Technical
adjustments&gt;</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Maybe you could start again. I don&#39;t think everyone could hear you.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> One argument in
favor of mortality mattering is that flu, which didn&#39;t really have that much of
a lasting impact on society, had a really high morbidity but a really small
mortality, and everyone knew that, and so they weren&#39;t panicked when it came.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. There&#39;s the idea then that we shouldn&#39;t retreat too much from mortality,
that it really does matter. And I&#39;m really happy that you did something very
important, which was not just to leave this matter hanging in the abstract, but
to tack it to a particular example. And, so, it&#39;s really important that you
bring in particular diseases to clinch your argument. Talking about influenza
is exactly the way that the argument ought to go, and weighing that versus
other diseases that were different. That&#39;s good. Thank you. Right, someone
else? Oh, there we go.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> At the same time, I
think that what that really speaks to is more the reaction of society to
something. So, that it&#39;s important to say that it&#39;s not just a number that
matters; that mortality rate isn&#39;t so much the important part as much as how
people were able to kind of incorporate that into their lives. Because as you
were saying, flu wasn&#39;t necessarily the most striking example to people.
However, I think that certain--even times like tuberculosis, where you have
people who are dying but in very much longer periods. So, you have more time
for reactions in literature and art, and those have just as much of an impact.
And, in fact, they&#39;re really lasting impacts because we still have those pieces
of epidemic art and literature to look back on, to see how they had impacts on
society.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay, yes, thanks very much. So, it&#39;s--you want to complicate the matter even
more--it really depends on how it&#39;s perceived, perceptions-- and also that&#39;s
reflected in the arts and in literature, and you&#39;re giving the example of
tuberculosis and the time period and how lasting the impact is. That
tuberculosis has--one of its reasons for having such an impact was that it was
such a slow event, and was with society for so long, and people reflected on
that, and it impacted the arts and culture.</p>
<p>Absolutely, I think
that would be. So, we&#39;ve got now--in order to deal with this, we&#39;ve dealt with
influenza and tuberculosis as contrasting factors, two diseases, in very
different ways. And it&#39;s certainly true that also on the exam we will be
dealing--I&#39;ll be asking you to be comparative in your discussion of diseases,
and to bring in more than one disease in order to deal with major questions
that cut across the whole of our course. Okay, thanks. Anything else we ought
to put in to our answer to this question? Would it be good to deal with just
two diseases in dealing with that? Would this be--would you get an A+ for
bringing in influenza and tuberculosis? What other diseases might be important
in considering this question? Yes, thanks. </p>
<p>&lt;Technical
adjustments&gt;</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> You might consider
cholera, because it was sort of the opposite of tuberculosis, in that it had a
very rapid onset, and so the specifics surrounding the disease itself had an
effect on how it was perceived as something frightening, and something gross.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. So, you would throw cholera into the mix. And I think the reason
you&#39;re--if I&#39;ve understood you, you&#39;re saying that this should take us into
another whole realm, which is to deal with the symptoms, because there was
something particularly frightening and disgusting about Asiatic cholera, and
that conditioned its impact. People were really terrified by its arrival,
because of the nature of its symptomatology. That&#39;s another dimension that we
ought to consider. </p>
<p>It&#39;s not just
morbidity, not just mortality, not just the profile of the victims, but the
kind of suffering that the disease imposes on its victims. So, the
symptomatology is tremendously important. Okay, anything else on that
question? Our grade is going up all the time. Several examples, specific
cases, that&#39;s comparison, that&#39;s all extremely important. Anything else anyone
wants to throw in on this question? So, collectively we&#39;ve got what? An A+ on
this? Okay, we&#39;ll pat ourselves on the back, and let&#39;s move on and see if
there are other issues we might like to discuss. </p>
<p>What is it--let me
see, I&#39;m wondering--I mentioned something in passing, and threw out a phrase,
which was that we might want to consider some diseases in our course &quot;diseases
of modernity.&quot; I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s actually a useful concept. It may be
that I misspoke. Or is modernity in some senses a factor that promotes our
vulnerability to high-impact epidemic diseases; or at least certain ones among
them? Is that true or is that wrong? Great.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> always like to put
a finer edge on it &lt;inaudible&gt;</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
You really do, yes.</p>
<p>&lt;Technical adjustments&gt;</p>
<p><b>Student: </b>I might put a finer
edge on it for the class by asking them if any real progress in social or
medical response to epidemic disease has occurred over the time span of the
course? </p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. In other words, are we more vulnerable now, or much less vulnerable, as
a result of public health policies and understanding of infectious diseases,
since, let&#39;s see, poor Daniel Defoe lived through the bubonic plague. That&#39;s
sort of your question, right?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Precisely. </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> It struck me that
your definition of a disease of modernity refers to structural factors.
Right? So, for instance, the role of mass transit technologies, perhaps
urbanization in abetting the spread of disease. Isn&#39;t that the sense of disease
of modernity? </p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
I think you&#39;re right. Who knows what I meant when I said it. But it would
seem to me, if we were retrospectively to try to make sense of a phrase like
that, we--and this is important and all. Here&#39;s a general point for any
answers that you give in an exam. You would have to provide a definition of
what it actually means. Modernity is a lovely phrase, but it doesn&#39;t
really--its meaning is not self-evident, and it was only--your grade would rise
very significantly if you weren&#39;t just to talk about modernity, but you were
actually to do what you just did, but to say, &quot;What does that mean?&quot;
and point to factors such as urbanization, mass transit, population growth,
things like that, that give it a meaning; and possibly also the development of
an understanding scientifically of the biology and the medicine of the
diseases, and therefore public health policies and practices. </p>
<p>That, I think, would
be a much better way to approach this idea of whether it&#39;s a disease of
modernity or not. And I&#39;m just wondering what would you say? Are we less
vulnerable now than London was at the time of Defoe; or is it still the same;
or are we vulnerable, but vulnerable to different kinds of diseases, at least
here in the West? Okay, great.</p>
<p>&lt;Technical
adjustments&gt;</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I would say that
we&#39;re more vulnerable to the spread of disease and to diseases that are a
result of over-sanitation, but that we&#39;re also more capable of dealing with
them, scientifically and technologically. </p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. So, it&#39;s neither--you&#39;re rejecting that opposition of being more or less
vulnerable. We&#39;re more vulnerable in certain ways, and less vulnerable in
others. Perhaps we&#39;re not as susceptible to certain diseases in the same way,
but we&#39;re susceptible to other diseases in different ways. Maybe the mode of
transmission is an important factor. But you wanted to say something too. Let&#39;s
come to you.</p>
<p>&lt;Technical
adjustments&gt;</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I also think that
in a way though we&#39;re sort of like shifting from one vague misconception of
disease causality to another. Because the earliest modes of disease prevention
were quarantine and just, like, whatever they could--like sanitation, like with
Chadwick. But then we moved to this magic bullet thing, once we figured out
that it was the germ theory. And for a really long time--and I think it still
sort of persists--is this idea that we can cure something just by finding a
magic drug. And that isn&#39;t really how it works, and there are a lot of other
factors. And even though we sort of acknowledge that sometimes, I don&#39;t think
that it&#39;s necessarily permeated our efforts to cure a lot of different
diseases. Like with AIDS you can kind of see that there&#39;s efforts at education
and things like that. But as long as there&#39;s poverty, there&#39;s going to be
diseases that disproportionately affect the poor, and I don&#39;t think that we&#39;re
anywhere near solving that problem.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. So, as I understand it, you&#39;re saying that we have made advances in
understanding, and there are diseases for which there are public health
measures that are effective, and there are sometimes magic bullets. But we
have become rather over--we overemphasize the importance of treatments, and we
underestimate the social economic determinants of disease. And, so, diseases
thrive on certain social and economic conditions--and you mentioned poverty,
for example--and so until those underlying substrates of epidemic diseases are
dealt with, we&#39;ll always remain vulnerable. So, that would suggest--maybe we
should take that on for a second. </p>
<p>Is that a valid
conclusion from the course, from your readings and all the rest, that diseases,
all diseases, are diseases of poverty?--would seem to be something you were
maybe suggesting. Or even if you weren&#39;t, I&#39;m suggesting it on your behalf.
Is that a valid conclusion to draw; that really the essential driver of
epidemic disasters is poverty? All diseases are diseases of poverty; is that
right? Right. Great, thanks.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I would disagree
with that statement because although--</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. I would too. </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> We see that, in
some cases, notably cholera, it did only strike the poor, and the rich were
pretty much unaffected by the disease, in terms of health, health-wise.
There&#39;s been plenty of other diseases that really haven&#39;t shown any liking to
any specific socioeconomic class. The flu just came in and, since it was so
easily spread from person to person, even if you were walking into a store run
by someone of a lower class, you could easily get that from them. So, I think
most diseases, even though some did strike the poor to a greater extent, you
can&#39;t classify them solely as being diseases of poverty. Where poverty might
have--not embellished--but poverty might have--imight have made it worse.
Someone in poverty would probably be worse off due to influenza than a richer
person. But I don&#39;t think it caused most of the diseases we&#39;ve talked about. </p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. There is the theory, then, that it really depends on which disease, and
that it&#39;s a gross oversimplification to say that poverty is the cause of
epidemic disease. It exacerbates the situation, probably for all. But there
are clearly certain diseases that are driven by other factors--and influenza
was a case in point--there&#39;s certain diseases that really do seem to be equal-opportunity
afflictions, in that they seem to strike all rungs of society, rather than just
certain economic and social classes. And influenza was a good--respiratory
diseases perhaps veer towards that pole. But then I think you&#39;re saying that
in any case it&#39;s probably not fair also completely to eliminate poverty; that
it&#39;s a sort of spectrum, and some diseases are more responsive to poverty, and
others less. But that even influenza---perhaps if you&#39;re poor, you don&#39;t have
access to medical care, to nursing, and to medications, and so on. And, so,
it&#39;s more of a problem, but it&#39;s a universal problem nonetheless. </p>
<p>Have I understood you
right, correctly? Okay. Good, thank you. I think you&#39;d be right. And I
think it would be good if in the answer--let&#39;s say we give a more coherent
answer if we gave a range of diseases in dealing with the answer, some at one
end of the spectrum and others at the other. Right? So, influenza would be
great. But it would be a mistake just to put influenza into the answer. We&#39;d
want to give contrasting examples. The answer, then, as many historical
answers, has to be qualified and nuanced, and just to say all diseases are
diseases of poverty is probably quite wrong. Okay. There was another--you were
going to--</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Well I was just
going to ask if we could maybe take the diseases that we looked at and almost
rank them in the order of how they affect--like how much certain diseases
&lt;inaudible&gt; from flu to cholera. </p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. Well, why don&#39;t I be a really, really nasty person and ask if you could
help me out? How would you rank them?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I haven&#39;t got a
clue. &lt;Inaudible&gt;.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
You&#39;ve got lots of people to help you out. You&#39;re not on your own. Okay?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> &lt;Inaudible&gt;.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
No.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I would start with
flu and then I&#39;d get to cholera.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. So, one end of the spectrum, we put influenza; and that would clearly be
the least responsive to poverty as a driver. The other end of the spectrum
you&#39;d put Asiatic cholera, which is clearly very sensitive to social and
economic factors, to living conditions, to dirt and filth, to lack of light, to
overcrowding. I hope you would then--you see, in your essay poverty too needs--it
is not self-evident what it means.</p>
<p>Why is poverty a
factor? And I hope you would talk about filth, access to medical care,
education, overcrowding, bad housing, sewage. Those are the things that
cholera thrives on. So, you would be right that way, putting influenza and
cholera at opposite poles of the spectrum. But once again, we have to remember
that this is not absolute, because wealthy people also succumbed to Asiatic
cholera, just in much smaller numbers. Okay. Right, thanks.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I think I would put
malaria, and to a lesser extent than plague, on the cholera side of things.
Malaria, because they--it was a big working condition disease, and a lot of
people who were in the lower classes worked in the rice fields where--and
worked and lived in areas that they couldn&#39;t have the simple protection against
mosquitoes. And I said plague to a lesser extent on the cholera side because,
as we saw in <i>Journal of the Plague Year</i>, a lot of the richer people were
able to leave London and use financial means to get away from the disease. And
even though it spread, the poorer people couldn&#39;t do that and they had to stay.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank Snowden:</b> Okay. So, we have
a couple of other examples of diseases that might be along the level of poverty--being
driven by poverty. And malaria was an example because of the particularly
laboring and living conditions. It&#39;s partly an occupational disease, and so it
strikes peasants and people who work in conditions that make them vulnerable;
and it&#39;s a house disease that depends on overcrowding and living in housing
that&#39;s porous to flying insects. Poverty clearly is important to the spread of
malaria. </p>
<p>We&#39;ve seen, to some
extent, that plague has some--it could be argued either way, but you&#39;re
absolutely right to introduce plague as something--a case to be argued as to
whether it is or isn&#39;t. I&#39;m wondering what about some other diseases
transmitted differently? One factor might be--then you might say it might
depend partly on means of transmission of the disease; perhaps airborne disease
is less driven by poverty. Ones that travel by the oral-fecal route, or by
vectors, might be important. What about sexually transmitted disease; and is
syphilis a disease of poverty? You wanted to--</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I would put AIDS
and syphilis towards the flu end of things. Although by modern maps of where
these diseases are highly prevalent, it would seem otherwise. But I think that
there is actually a sort of not poverty-based reason for that.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. So, we have a candidate then for--two other candidates to go at the
influenza end of the spectrum: syphilis and AIDS. I&#39;m wondering if everyone
would agree with that. Yes, please? Oh sorry. Go ahead first.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Yes, I would put
AIDS more towards the middle of the spectrum, because AIDS did have a
predilection for marginalized groups. But at the same time it could affect
anyone, including a heterosexual man from a wealthy family. So, I think it
sort of goes in the middle. If I could add one to the list, maybe I would put
SARS as closer to the flu end of the spectrum, because it did seem to--and this
adds to the idea that airborne diseases are less driven by poverty--because it
did seem to affect everyone. But at the same time, it did hit areas that had a
strong health infrastructure, and that helped to quell the disease somewhat.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. I&#39;m wondering--I like your answer and I&#39;m just wondering if with
HIV/AIDS we would want even to make distinctions, in that HIV/AIDS seems to
have different phases and different epidemiologies, according to different
circumstances; and that in the industrial West it seems to be a disease, more of
marginal groups, at least at the moment. It used not to be. When it was first
introduced into the United States, for example, it wasn&#39;t an example of
socioeconomic marginality; but rather people who, because of sexual
orientation, or through blood supplies and so forth. But it would seem that if
you were dealing at a global level now, with AIDS in Africa for example,
poverty does seem to be a very important factor in the disease. Would you not
agree with that?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Yes definitely. I
think in countries where there is more wealth, it&#39;s seen more as a chronic
disease. So, definitely.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. Great, well thank you. So, we could even talk--divide--break some of
the diseases down into different periods in their transmission. And you wanted
to add something?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> That was the
comment.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Oh, that was what you wanted to add. Okay. Well, there&#39;s another. Thank
you. </p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I was just going to
say that tuberculosis should be added to the list--probably more on the end of
influenza--simply because they kind of regarded it as disease of the rich for
some time--and a disease of genius, I think it was--because of the people that
it affected.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. So, there&#39;s the thought that maybe tuberculosis ought to be added to the
influenza end of the spectrum, in that it seemed to be, looking back on the
nineteenth-century experience of the disease, it was even described as a
disease of beauty, of genius. And clearly we can make a long list of high
society people--celebrities, artists, kings and queens--who were afflicted by
tuberculosis. And I think that if you were dealing with the nineteenth
century, that would be a splendid argument to make, and I agree with you entirely.
</p>
<p>I&#39;m just wondering
though if we come forward, fast forward in time to today, then I think we have
to say that the epidemiology of tuberculosis today is different, and that it
thrives on preexisting conditions, on overcrowding. So, I think the time
period can also be important. Tuberculosis has retreated to areas of poverty,
I would argue, now. Would you agree with that?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Yes. I was going
to say that what you were just talking about; how, like, different time eras
actually can delineate whether or not it is a disease of poverty or not, just
by the people that it affects, the effect it has on the society at the present
moment. </p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay, thanks very much. Yes. I think we&#39;re seeing that describing diseases as
diseases of poverty is really a complex and also debatable position, and it
depends on what diseases, where, when and so forth. It&#39;s actually--one needs
to break down what poverty is, and one needs to have a spectrum of diseases.
But I think we&#39;re dealing with it much more effectively. And I think one of
the things we see is that the more complexity, the more nuance, the better our
answer is becoming; also the more interesting. </p>
<p>I think it&#39;s rather a
bland and not very convincing answer to say simply all diseases are diseases of
poverty, and I think we now see that actually the situation is much more
complex than that; that poverty&#39;s an important factor but it doesn&#39;t simply--we
can&#39;t reduce our course to that one variable. Okay. In the meanwhile have you
thought of other questions that we ought to be dealing with in our course? Or
shall I put it another way; are there major themes in our course? What--could
we make maybe a shortlist of themes that you should be thinking about as you do
your revision? What are the major themes that we&#39;ve been dealing with this
semester? Disease and poverty is an example. Are there other themes? Go for
it.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I guess another
theme has been the magic bullet theory of combating disease, and the idea that
any epidemic disease can be solved basically by coming up with some sort of
scientific cure that--so just, I guess, quinine in the case of malaria. I
guess in the case of--or quinine and then DDT in the case of malaria. And I
guess that theme has been one that has sort of been underlying what has been
sort of this triumphal age of American medicine, and one that I think, at least
in emerging and remerging disease, is something that we&#39;re increasingly viewing
as not exactly the most effective way of dealing with epidemic disease.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay, thanks very much. Yes, one of the--another theme of our course has been
the tendency to think of finding a magic bullet to each infectious disease.
And you were just starting to do what I think would then be really important if
that were a question on the final, which is to look at what is the history of
magic bullets, and have they actually delivered on the promise associated with
them? And examples that you gave--let&#39;s see, quinine with regard to malaria, or
later on DDT with regard to malaria, and has that--would that be--would malaria
be a good example of a disease that&#39;s been highly responsive to magic bullets?
You&#39;re shaking your head. Do you want to add to your headshake?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> No. Because there were
side effects to these mass treatments, and it wasn&#39;t a one-size-fits-all sort
of response to malaria. And there were other social factors that weren&#39;t
considered. And people were thinking at that time that if we applied DDT for a
certain amount of time, then malaria would be eradicated forever. But that
certainly wasn&#39;t the case, and conditions could change and the disease came
back. I think it was the case near Italy where they built the dam, and then
during the war the dam was broken, and then later the disease came back, during
the war. So, these measures aren&#39;t permanent, as they thought they initially
were. In that sense this magic bullet can&#39;t be the permanent final answer.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. So, we have a problem with malaria. There was this great euphoria of
thinking that a magic bullet could be found, and quinine and DDT were examples,
but they ended up not actually delivering on the promise. Chloroquine would be
yet another example of a magic bullet, for dealing with malaria. So, I would
agree entirely. Malaria would be a wonderful example of enormous expectations
of a magic bullet as a solution, and yet we see that, in fact, the biology of
the disease is much more complicated than being dealt with in that way, and
we&#39;ve seen resistance being developed by mosquitoes and by plasmodia. And, so,
the promise of the magic bullets, with malaria, turned out to be a tool. And
they&#39;re useful but they haven&#39;t rid the world at all of the disease. And there
was--you wanted also to say something.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Yes. And I think
to go along with that, there&#39;s another reason why magic bullets can&#39;t entirely
work--and that&#39;s another theme of the class--which is the idea of disease as a
social construction. And the fact is that even if a magic bullet can have a
great effect on the biology, or the symptomatology, of a disease--I think
Barnes is the author who really went into the idea that in order to really
attack a disease, it goes into the substratum of society and to our ideas about
disease and what we place, the stigma that we place on them.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. So we can&#39;t just think in terms of magic bullets. We also have to think
about the ideas in people&#39;s heads. How do they understand the disease? What&#39;s
the social construction? And you gave the example of tuberculosis as a good
example. Okay, I would entirely agree with that too. I&#39;m wondering if there
are other examples of magic bullets that have either delivered on the promise,
or have failed to deliver on the promise. We&#39;ve talked about malaria: quinine,
DDT, chloroquine. What about other--have magic bullets played a role in our
course with other diseases? Yes, go for it.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The original magic
bullet was with syphilis though--right?--with penicillin. And I think that was
a pretty good example. I mean, and Brandt&#39;s point, in <i>No Magic Bullet</i>,
is that it didn&#39;t really--I mean, it helped, but it didn&#39;t really slow the
incidence. Like it would sort of go in crests and waves, where there were
people who were soldiers in the army and they would get prostitutes, and then
it kind of didn&#39;t really matter whether there was a cure for syphilis or not,
because like they just wouldn&#39;t have had access to it; like even if they
contracted the disease. So, education and other programs like that are just as
important as drugs, when it comes to preventing something like an STD.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. The history of syphilis would be another good case study for whether
magic bullets are the way to eradicate or control major diseases. And you used
the example of penicillin, which is a good one. But I think we&#39;ve had, with
syphilis, even further back, other things that at the time were thought of as
magic bullets; mercury before that, and salversan, would be other earlier ideas
considered magic bullets that also didn&#39;t eliminate the disease. The diseases
tend to be much more complicated than to be simply amenable to a magic bullet
solution. So, syphilis is another example, along with malaria. Right? Are
there other examples? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> One instance where
this magic bullet idea did seem to work was in the case of smallpox, where a
vaccine was developed and given to all the population, such that the disease no
longer had a host of humans, a reserve full of hosts to infect, and the disease
eventually was eradicated. And I think that&#39;s one example where this magic
bullet was effective. But it was a very special case, in the case of smallpox,
because the smallpox vaccine was very effective. And I think we talked about
how it&#39;s very much disease-specific. And smallpox seems to be an exception
rather than the rule, in terms of how magic bullets can work.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay, thanks. So, we need to be careful, even in our skepticism about magic
bullets, that there may be cases when they can actually work; and a good
example being smallpox in which the vaccine has actually eradicated naturally-occurring
smallpox from the world. There are examples. But then one has--you were also
saying what lessons should be drawn from smallpox? And you were saying perhaps
one of the lessons though is that smallpox is atypical. It had certain
specific features about it that made it particularly vulnerable to attack by
vaccination. But we can&#39;t throw out then the hope for finding tools that will
actually eradicate diseases, and smallpox is an example of something that
really did work. Yes, okay. </p>
<p>Any other examples
that ought to be thrown into our mix? How about TB? And streptomycin would be
another example, I would think, of something that seemed, after World War II,
that it would be possible to close all of the sanitaria; and that largely
happened, and the outlook seemed to be that TB would be eliminated by this
magic bullet. But we see again the problem of drug resistance, and we&#39;re
living now in a world in which there&#39;s multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis.
And, so, once again we have an example of a disease that&#39;s been much more
recalcitrant, because we see the--I guess that Darwin was right--the influence
of evolution and its impact on the microbes surrounding us. Okay. </p>
<p>Is there another
major theme of our course? We&#39;ve seen magic bullets, we&#39;ve seen poverty, we&#39;ve
seen modes of transmission as major impacts on disease. We&#39;ve talked about
mortality, morbidity, and whether--how you--what are the--symptomatology--what
are the factors that contribute to the impact of a disease on society? We have
just a few more minutes. So, I&#39;m wondering if we have at least one more
candidate for a major theme of our course. Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> The evolution of
public health strategies in response to epidemic disease. </p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. That&#39;s not fair. You read my mind. I was thinking of exactly that.
And I did want to say that it would be unfortunate if you went to the final
exam in our course without also thinking about public health as a major theme
that we&#39;ve covered in our course. And let me just--could we make a list now?
We don&#39;t have time for discussion, but what are some of the major forms of public
health strategy that we have talked about? Okay.</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Quarantine.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. Quarantine. And maybe we might enlarge that by saying--could we talk
about plague strategies of defense against infectious disease? Meaning
quarantines, sanitary cordons, possibly lazarettos and pest houses, all the
rest that go with that. Yes, that&#39;s a recurrent--and that&#39;s not only against
plague, but plague strategies were rolled out again and again in our course.
We&#39;ve seen them applied, not very helpfully, against cholera. We&#39;ve seen them
also--plague strategies--being applied against HIV/AIDS, in the early days.
Okay, so that&#39;s one style of public health. What other measures of public
health have we seen? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> We&#39;ve seen
vaccinations, concealment, educational campaigns.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay, you&#39;ve got a list here, that&#39;s three more styles. We&#39;ve seen vaccination
as--you remember going back to Edward Jenner and--that was a long time ago, I
admit, but that&#39;s important to remember. There were--we&#39;ve also seen
concealment, and we saw concealment in the case of SARS. It occurred in the
case of cholera, in our course. We&#39;ve talked about education and its impact on
public health. Are there other styles of public health that we&#39;ve come
across? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> Miasmatism, for a
time.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay. We&#39;ve seen public health based on miasmatism, and with the filth theory
of disease. And therefore sanitation, introducing urban cleanups, sewer
systems; even the rebuilding of cites, as we saw under Haussmann in France.
And we saw that in the rebuilding of Naples also. So, those are additional
styles of public health. Anything else anyone wants to throw in? Or is there
maybe another final sort of question or theme of the course? We&#39;ve just
briefly suggested public health, and a few dimensions. There are others, and I
hope that you&#39;ll dig them out also. Is there any final question anyone wants
to bring up? Yes?</p>
<p><b>Student:</b> I think maybe we
missed the intrusion of the modern state played a role in it; dispensaries and
registries of victims of disease.</p>
<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay, okay. We could discuss also the way in which the modern state has played
a role in the control of disease, and that we can see that in tuberculosis,
through dispensaries, sanatoria. We can see that also playing a role through
malaria, and the same sort of idea of dispensaries again. And there are other
diseases as well. The state playing a role in education, the state playing a
role in the plague measures also. So, I think we can see the role of the state
as a major player, a central player, in public health could indeed be an
important theme of our class. But having said that, another theme is stopping
when we&#39;ve run out of time. And, so, I&#39;ll do that, and wish you good luck on
the final. And thank you this morning for helping us put our heads together.
And I liked your comments. Thanks very much.</p>
