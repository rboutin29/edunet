<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
I&#39;d like to welcome you back, and hope that you all had really good breaks.
We&#39;ll be talking this week about malaria, both today and on Wednesday. And I
think I may be saying a couple of things that you may find surprising. I
suppose--this may be an assumption--that when I mention malaria, that most of
you think of it as an exotic tropical disease, and probably think that it&#39;s
very distant from us, and has relatively little to do with the modern world, or
with modern history, and probably nothing at all to do with the United States
and with those of us here. But the point I&#39;m wanting to make, this time and
next, is that the reality of malaria is quite different from that; that when
we&#39;ve come to talk about this disease, I could say that of all human diseases
it&#39;s one of the oldest; and some question, a question that some of you might
ask me, is of all the diseases in our course, which is the one that, in the
aggregate, has caused the most human suffering and death? And I think that of
all of the diseases in our course, it&#39;s probably malaria which has that
primacy. </p>
<p>The relationship of
human beings to malaria has been so close, and so extensive, that we could also
say that we, as a species, and malaria, as a disease, have evolved together,
and that the human genome bears the imprint of our experience with malaria.
Good examples of that are a couple of genetic diseases that I&#39;d like to
mention, one that may be familiar to you also, one being sickle-cell anemia, a
second being thalassemia, and a third being what&#39;s called Duffy negativity.
Now, all of these are genetic diseases, and they have in common the feature
that there&#39;s a difference between the trait which--it&#39;s a recessive in all
three cases, the recessive features. </p>
<p>And, so, a
heterozygote--that is, a person who has just one X chromosome, rather than X
and Y, expressing the trait for the disease--enjoys a protection from malaria.
But if, in fact, you are a homozygote and have it on both X and Y chromosomes,
and you develop the syndrome for sickle-cell anemia, instead you have a
terrible disease that leads to--it causes sickle cell--it affects the quality
of the hemoglobin and the red cells, and therefore it leads to anemia,
occlusion of blood vessels, sometimes hypoxia, and serious respiratory
diseases. So, it&#39;s a fatal illness in many cases. But if you have the trait,
then in a highly malarial area you have a great selective advantage in enjoying
a great deal of resistance or immunity. </p>
<p>In terms of human
evolution, in intensely malarial areas there was a strong Darwinian pressure
for the retention of the sickle cell trait. The same would be true of
thalassemia, which affects not the quality of the red cells but rather their
quantity, and leads to again terrible complications in homozygotes, and with
asthma and terrible anemia, or Duffy negativity, which is another genetic
disease that leads again to terrible diseases. Another feature of malaria,
apart from the fact that our genome has actually been strongly influenced by
our history with malaria, is that until very recently it extended more or less
across the globe, affecting not only the tropics in Africa, Asia and South
America, but also the north, including most of Europe and North America. So, I
thought I&#39;d show you a map of malaria in the United States in the nineteenth
century, just to give you an idea--this is 1882--to show how extensively
prevalent it was in this country, as recently as the late nineteenth century.
And indeed it comes up--Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a book on malaria in New
England. </p>
<p>This is a map of
1912, when it&#39;s receded a great deal and is primarily a disease of the South.
But remember that it had a major impact on public health in this country, until
the end of the Second World War, which is when it was eradicated in the United
States. It&#39;s sobering to remember, for example, that the Centers for Disease
Control, the CDC, in Atlanta, was originally founded as an anti-malarial
agency, and that the disease played a major role in the settlement of the West,
and in the economic and social development of the South. And if you read Mark
Twain, for example, you can read a great deal about shivering along the banks
of the Mississippi River. In terms of our discussion of relationship of
diseases to the big picture of history, malaria is also one of the diseases
that I think helps us to make the case most effectively. </p>
<p>Malaria, it&#39;s now
believed, played a major part in the fall, for example, of the Roman Empire,
when an epidemic of <i>falciparum</i> malaria led to the disruption of
agriculture and the Roman Legions. And I&#39;m not trying to say that malaria
caused the downfall of the Roman Empire. I&#39;m saying that it was a major factor,
leading to the kinds of military problems and social dislocation that we can&#39;t
ignore in discussing that major series of events. It&#39;s led to major impacts on
the outcome and on the conduct of warfare. One need go back only to the Second
World War, when malaria was a major preoccupation of the armies on both sides
of the conflict. It had an enormous role and impact on European expansion and
colonization, and one of the great challenges to colonial expansion, in the
Indian subcontinent, and in Africa, was what to do about the problem of
malaria. </p>
<p>It&#39;s affected the
pattern of human habitation and settlement, the way that cities and towns are
built across the landscape, where human habitation often was a form of
prophylaxis for malaria, and people lived far from swampy areas, and often on
high ground, above dangerous wetlands low down. Malaria is also a major factor
in economic development and under-development today, in ways that we&#39;ll be
discussing. A decisive factor in its prevalence, and in its history, has
always been the relationship of human beings to agriculture and the
environment; that is to say that intensive forms of agriculture, with modern
livestock raising practices, modern crop rotations, water management,
ecological sanitation, with improved housing and conditions of diet, wages and
clothing, have led, wherever they&#39;ve been introduced, to a spontaneous
recession of malaria and much better health outcomes. </p>
<p>And this has been a
major factor in the divergence between the global North and the global South;
the North with modernized intensive systems of agriculture, and in the South
instead the persistence of extensive forms of practice that are conducive, for
reasons we&#39;ll be examining, to the transmission of malaria. So, malaria both
reflects and reinforces developmental differences and disparities. Now, let&#39;s
remember that malaria is vitally important in our world today. Let me give you
an example of some of the pictures that represent the global burden of malaria,
and let me show you a map of where malaria is prevalent today; that is, in the
twenty-first century. Indeed, at the moment, one can say the statistics are
extraordinary. </p>
<p>About 500,000 people
become seriously ill of malaria every year. Approximately a million people die
of it, the majority of them being children under five, and pregnant women,
concentrated particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, one can say that a
child dies of malaria, in Africa today, every thirty seconds, making this
disease a global public health emergency, along with HIV/AIDS and
tuberculosis. Let&#39;s look at more particularly the areas. This is the
epicenter, if you like, of the present day resurgence of malaria as a major,
major public health problem. And there are--malaria kills 3,000 children every
day of the year. The burden of malaria though is greater than statistics for
mortality and morbidity suggest. It is, for example, one of the worst possible
complications of pregnancy. It leads to high rates of miscarriage; to maternal
death through hemorrhaging and severe anemia, and all of the sequelae that
follow from severe low birth rate. </p>
<p>Malaria also can be
transmitted vertically; that is, trans-plancentally, from mother to fetus, and
can lead to the birth of infants who are congenitally infected. We also need
to remember, as we&#39;ll say in a moment, that malaria is a major
immunosuppressive disease, and its victims therefore are highly susceptible to
other opportunistic infections; especially respiratory infections,
tuberculosis, influenza, pneumonia. In those areas of the tropical world where
malaria is hyper-endemic, and transmission continues throughout the year, the
population at risk can be infected, re-infected and super-infected every single
year. If the victims of malaria survive, they possess a painfully acquired
immunity. But it comes at a terrible price, because repeated bouts of malaria
lead to severe neurological deficit and cognitive impairment. The results are
ineradicable poverty, illiteracy and compromised economic growth, a stunted
development of civil society and political instability. </p>
<p>We&#39;ll be talking in a
moment about Ronald Ross, who was the Nobel Laureate, who was one of two people
who discovered the mosquito theory of transmission for disease. And he wrote,
quite movingly, that those malaria doesn&#39;t--in areas where malaria is
prevalent--&quot;those it doesn&#39;t kill it enslaves.&quot; Malaria, in other
words, in our present world, is a major contributor to inequalities between North
and South, and to the economic and political international dependency of
third-world countries in the tropical world. Well, let&#39;s talk about
the--malaria also will be of interest to us because it&#39;s an extremely complex
disease, and so we need to spend a little bit of time talking about how it&#39;s
transmitted, and about its effects on the human body, in order, after that, to
talk about how the discoveries that led to our understanding of it, and to the
impact on society and on history. </p>
<p>Until the end of the
nineteenth century, malaria was thought to be explained by a theory that you
already know, by miasmatism. In other words, malaria was a form of bad air.
In fact, that&#39;s what the word means, from the Italian <i>mala</i>, bad, and <i>aria</i>,
air. So, malaria was bad air that somehow a susceptible person inhaled, and it
got in his or her body, or was absorbed, perhaps, through the pores of the
skin, and led, in susceptible people, to this terrible fever. It was also
sometimes called paludisme, from the word for swamp; so it was swamp fever. So,
the disease then was absorbed or breathed in, in some way. </p>
<p>In fact, malaria
isn&#39;t one disease. It&#39;s a family of four different diseases, caused by a
parasite, with an extremely complex lifecycle. The parasite is known as a
plasmodium, and there are four species of plasmodium that cause human malaria.
And I have them on your handout. They&#39;re <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, <i>Plasmodium
vivax</i>, <i>Plasmodium malariae</i>, and <i>Plasmodium ovale</i>. For the
purposes here, the first two, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and <i>Plasmodium
vivax</i>, are the most important, medically and historically, and the ones
we&#39;ll be talking about mostly. Now, the plasmodia differ fundamentally from
the other microbial pathogens we&#39;ve examined so far in the course--bacteria,
for example, and viruses--in that they&#39;re much more complex life forms, with
complex lifecycles that we need to unravel. </p>
<p>Plasmodia were
discovered in 1884 by Alphonse Laveran--there he is--a French Army doctor
working in Algeria. It turns out that the plasmodia don&#39;t exist free in the
environment at any stage of their lives. Instead, they&#39;re adapted to live
either in the body of human beings, or in the gut of certain species of
mosquitoes. And--there we are--this is an anopheles mosquito doing its thing;
that is to say, having a blood meal, which is the way that malaria is
transmitted from person to person. The plasmodia--this is again, in a more
schematic way, it gets the point across about the relationship of human beings
and the mosquito. </p>
<p>Plasmodia migrate in
the body of the insect to the salivary glands in the biting apparatus. So, a
biting mosquito, like this one, is in effect an extremely efficient vector.
It&#39;s sometimes referred to as a flying syringe, because what it does, the
mosquito does, is to inoculate the plasmodia directly into the bloodstream of
the host. At this stage the parasite--we&#39;ll move to look at what happens
next. The first thing we have is the mosquito taking a blood meal and
inoculating the plasmodia directly into the bloodstream of the unfortunate
victim. </p>
<p>At that stage--and
here we&#39;ll see one of the points about the plasmodia, is that it undergoes a
series of morphological changes in becoming distinct stages in its life, both
in the human body and in the body of the insect. Initially when it&#39;s injected,
it&#39;s known as a sporazoite, and what it does next is it migrates, after just a
few hours after inoculation--say you were bitten right now, within a few hours
the plasmodia in your bloodstream would have migrated to your liver. And this
begins the incubation period in which the plasmodium reproduces--that is,
asexually--in the liver. And you see its reproduction. And then after just a
number of days or weeks, it&#39;s released again now in a new phase, this time
known as a merozoite, into the bloodstream. So, it returns at that point to
the bloodstream. </p>
<p>One of the points of
the migration to the liver is that when it&#39;s in the liver, it&#39;s safely beyond
the detection of the human immune system, and so it reproduces safely in the
liver and then emerges, much more numerous, into the bloodstream in a new phase
in its lifecycle. At this point in the bloodstream what happens is that the
merozoites--that&#39;s what they&#39;re now called, the new name of the parasite for
that phase--it enters into--it attaches itself to and enters into red blood
cells or erythrocytes. Once safely inside the red blood cell--again it&#39;s not
detected by the immune system--it reproduces asexually--and you can see it
doing so--until at a certain point it has destroyed the red blood cell and
ruptures the red blood cell, and the parasites return once again to the
bloodstream. I have--this is a picture. </p>
<p>These are of the--by
electron microscope--of the actual rupturing of red blood cells, and the
emergence, once gain, of the parasites that have just reproduced, returning to
the open bloodstream. At that point, the much more numerous merozoites keep
repeating this process of invading red cells, reproducing, destroying the red
blood cells, and then bursting them at periodic intervals. The interval of
time that it takes is determined by the species of plasmodium. For <i>Plasmodium
falciparum</i> and <i>vivax</i>, it&#39;s every forty-eight hours. And so for <i>Plasmodium
malariae</i>, it&#39;s every seventy-two. </p>
<p>Now, eventually,
among the brood of merozoites--that is, let&#39;s see, again--after it&#39;s gone
through a number of cycles, they produce among their offspring what are
called--it&#39;s a new morphologically different stage in the lifecycle, and that
is gametocytes, that are male and female; and these are in the open
bloodstream. And then the next anopheline mosquito that takes a blood meal, as
it does so it sucks up the male and female gametocytes that reproduce sexually
this time--we see them here--in the gut, in the body of the female mosquito,
and then that begins the phase of life in the body of the mosquito where once
again we find it reproduces; and eventually it leads to the production of
sporozoites that migrate, once again, to the biting apparatus, the salivary
glands of the mosquito. </p>
<p>The mosquito again
takes an infective bite and then--in its next blood meal--and the whole cycle,
this complex cycle of both asexual reproduction in the body of man, and sexual
reproduction in the body of the mosquito, the cycle is then complete. Now,
let&#39;s return for a second to the plasmodia and to the insect. And let me just
deal with the fact that in order--the reason that the female--and it&#39;s only
female anophelines that take blood meals on human beings--and the reason that
the female anopheline does that is that it needs blood in order to mature its
eggs and to lay them. Having taken a blood meal, she&#39;s able to mature her
eggs, and at that point lays them in water, and they pass through the cycle of
larvae, pupae, and then the adult mosquito known as an imago. </p>
<p>Now, what happens at
that point? It takes about a week for the eggs to develop as larvae, pupae and
then adult mosquitoes, and then the mosquito is ready to take flight and to
visit you and me. From the breeding site to the blood meal, the anopheles
mosquitoes have delicate wings and are normally weak flyers. So, normally she
flies about no more than three kilometers or so, from her birthplace. Most
species of anopheles avoid sunlight, that dries up their wings, and they avoid
strong winds. But as they take flight, they&#39;re able to orient themselves to
places of human settlement. Why? Because on their antennae there are sensors
that are highly stimulated by carbon dioxide in the air. And, so, this--the
carbon dioxide plume arising from human settlements and human bodies, enables
the mosquitoes to be attracted to them. </p>
<p>Having arrived at
closer range, the mosquitoes then detect, with other sensors, odors emanating
from sweat. They&#39;re also attracted by light. And then at close range they
finally use their vision to settle on the site of the body most suitable for
their feast. And human beings cooperate in this enterprise in that anopheline
mosquitoes feast between dusk and dawn, and they thereby attack sleeping
bodies, lying mostly motionless. Now, when you hear the buzz of the harmless culex
mosquito that buzzes noisily around you and attracts your attention, you can be
happy, because most anophelines that transmit malaria are silent and therefore
don&#39;t disturb their hosts. </p>
<p>You&#39;re probably
wondering, how is it that transmission is maintained if the vast majority of
mosquitoes don&#39;t transmit malaria? Only the females of certain species of anophelines--and
I&#39;ve included two on your handout as being most important to us: <i>Anopheles
gambiae</i>, which would be my candidate for the most deadly insect for human
beings on our planet, and <i>Anopheles labranchiae</i>, which was one of the
most important vectors of malaria in Europe and in parts of Africa. You&#39;re
probably wondering if a female anopheline mosquito lives on average just a few
weeks, and needs to be infected herself before transmitting the disease, how
can transmission be maintained? </p>
<p>Well, there&#39;s a
couple of facts that we need to remember. First, is the vast numbers of
mosquitoes involved in areas where malaria is endemic. In most areas of high
endemicity, no more than two percent or so of female mosquitoes are infected at
any given time. But on average, a human being can be bitten thousands of time
in a year. And it&#39;s also true that an insect like <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> is
famished and doesn&#39;t feed a single time, but having entered a place of human
settlement feasts repeatedly, moving from one body to another, thereby ensuring
that in crowded conditions one malarial patient is a major source of danger to
all of those around him or her. </p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s the
story from the standpoint of the mosquito. What happens to the human victim?
What are the symptoms of malaria? How does the disease have its impact on the
human body? After the incubation period, symptoms begin when the plasmodia
have achieved a critical threshold number in the bloodstream. It&#39;s then that
the classical symptoms of malaria begin, with their onset. Now, let&#39;s remember--return
to our diagram. This process of reproduction, of entering--that is to say the
parasite enters the blood cell, reproduces, bursts the blood cell and returns
to the bloodstream--occurs simultaneously for an entire brood throughout the
bloodstream. In other words, this is happening at the same time throughout the
body. And it&#39;s when there are sufficient numbers of the parasite in the open
bloodstream that the immune system of the body can detect the parasite, and
it&#39;s then that symptoms begin. </p>
<p>The term for malaria
also--it has many names, this disease. It was often called intermittent
fever. This process of synchronicity was known as Golgi&#39;s law, after the
malariologist Camillo Golgi, who discovered it; and he talked about the
different timings of fever. Tertian fever, that is to say, every forty-eight
hours; or Quartan fever, every seventy-two hours; or Quotidian fever. You can
also have a bout of intense fever every twenty-four hours, and that means that
you have more than one species of plasmodium in your bloodstream. You don&#39;t
have to choose just one, you can have several species and several types in your
bloodstream at once. If that occurs, you can have fever, intermittent fever,
every twenty-four hours. </p>
<p>The recurring classic
symptoms then are this intermittent fever, recurring at regular intervals, like
a train schedule. You have recurring paroxysms of high temperature, plus
chills, profuse sweating, headache, general malaise, exhaustion, and with it
often nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The precise symptoms depend on the
species of plasmodium, and the most virulent is <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>,
which causes the most frequent life-threatening complications, and <i>Plasmodium
malariae</i> and <i>ovale</i> are the most mild. You see that by entering the
red and attacking red blood cells, the parasite initiates a cascade of
consequences. The red cells can become misshapen, and they adhere to one
another in clumps, thereby causing blockages in blood cells- blood vessels,
that can be rapidly fatal, depending on the organ that&#39;s affected. </p>
<p>A frequent cause of
mortality is cerebral malaria, in which there are blockages in the brain. But
the heart can also be affected, or the gastrointestinal system; and if malaria
attacks the gastrointestinal in particular, it mimics the symptoms of Asiatic
cholera. Destruction of the red blood cells also is a cause of profound
anemia. Another important symptom of the disease is--and this is a child who&#39;s
a malaria patient, and what you see is a painful and pronounced swelling of the
spleen. This is one of the classic signs of malarial infection. As I&#39;ve said,
also malaria is terrible in its effects on pregnant women, leading to
hemorrhaging and miscarriage, and also to congenital malaria with infants born
with the disease. </p>
<p>Malaria also is a
disease that&#39;s a major immunosuppressive disease. It suppresses the immune
system of the body, and therefore gives rise to complications, especially
respiratory diseases; as I mentioned earlier, pneumonia, influenza and
tuberculosis. So, we should say that the tuberculosis emergency in the present
day, and the malaria emergency, are inter-locking and inter-related; malaria
provides the substratum for rampaging re-emerging tuberculosis. I also said
that recurring bouts of malaria lead to neurological damage, and in the worst
cases to a state known as cachexia, in which a person is indifferent to his or
her surroundings; is unable to learn to be productive, to take part in civil
society. </p>
<p>Another feature of
malaria is that it can lead to relapses; that is, with <i>Plasmodium vivax</i>.
You remember that after the plasmodium is injected into the bloodstream, it
migrates to the liver. Well in <i>Plasmodium vivax</i>, the parasite does
emerge, but not all of the parasites. They continue to nestle in the liver,
and they&#39;re beyond the detection of the immune system. And they can then--even
after the patient thinks that he or she has recovered, there can be a relapse
when the plasmodia, the parasites, re-emerge from the liver into the
bloodstream. This can be months later, or even years later, after the initial
infection. Immunity--that is, once you&#39;ve had lots of bouts of malaria, and
you survive, you develop a partial immunity, an acquired immunity. But it is
short-term, and it&#39;s also at considerable cost in terms of neurological damage
to the body. </p>
<p>Well, the impact on
society, as you can imagine, is severe; and we&#39;ll be talking about that next
time. But it leads, this disease--the symptoms, listing the symptoms, helps us
to understand that someone like this as an adult, who&#39;s anemic, who has perhaps
respiratory diseases, moves painfully and slowly, and is therefore not a
productive worker in agriculture or in industry. So, malaria leads to backward
systems of cultivation, low productivity, and lack of investment in
agriculture. It leads to the desertion of whole- of some of the most fertile
areas, land, because it&#39;s particularly dangerous, and known to be so. It leads
then to poverty, to illiteracy. </p>
<p>Indeed, malaria and
poverty are mutually reinforcing in a kind of vicious downward spiral. Poverty
makes people vulnerable to the disease. Poverty, that is, makes people
vulnerable because it causes them to live in poor housing, overcrowded housing;
housing that&#39;s porous and vulnerable to flying insects. It also leads them to
occupational hazards in having to work in areas where the disease is prevalent.
It leads to poor diet, which makes people more vulnerable; to inadequate
clothing, which makes them more vulnerable to biting insects. But malaria, in
turn, then leads to further poverty. The burden of looking after the ill, that
falls on families and communities; low productivity; low wages; limited
education. This was what Ross meant when he says, &quot;Those malaria doesn&#39;t
kill, it enslaves.&quot; </p>
<p>Well, when was the
mosquito theory of transmission unraveled, and how so? The idea that
mosquitoes were involved in this disease wasn&#39;t at all obvious. It wasn&#39;t
obvious because, well, first of all scientists and physicians knew that there
are lots of places where there are gazillions of mosquitoes and no malaria. It
was also clear that mosquitoes--there was no clear correlation between being
bitten by mosquitoes and developing the disease. And so the dominant theory in
the nineteenth century was of miasmatism as the cause of the disease. The
unraveling of the disease--you&#39;ll remember this man, Patrick Manson, the father
of tropical medicine. He was also one of the figures who was most closely
associated in the development of tropical medicine, and of the mosquito theory
of transmission, which he discovered for a different disease called filaria.
And then he had the idea that perhaps if filaria could be transmitted by
mosquitoes, possibly malaria could as well. And so he joined forces--he
worked, Manson, in London. </p>
<p>This is Ronald Ross,
who was a British military physician working in India. Now, India was a
tremendously important place in terms of malaria. Let me just--there was a
book that you might be interested in, and that I would recommend to those of
you who are, which is the correspondence between Ronald Ross and Patrick
Manson, that led them to the discovery of the mosquito theory of transmission.
Now Ross worked in India, and he noted that malaria, amongst the general
population of India in the 1890s, led to 5,000,000 deaths. And he said that it
was the greatest problem of public health in India. &quot;I think on the
whole,&quot; he wrote, &quot;that the Indian population of 400,000,000, it
causes directly or indirectly 10,000 deaths a day. And apart from this amount
of sickness, malaria is, of all diseases, the most important in political,
agricultural and military affairs,&quot; he wrote, &quot;since it renders large
tracts of fertile land uninhabitable, impedes cultivation, planting and public
works, and is the most fierce, vicious enemy that armies in the field have to
contend against. On the whole I think we&#39;re justified in claiming that the
malaria question is as important as famine or bubonic plague.&quot; </p>
<p>In India, what Ross
and Manson did was to discover--let&#39;s go back to our picture of the lifecycle
of malaria. They traced--through microscopy, were able to detect in the body
of the mosquito after it had bitten, and they did experiments in which
they--among not human beings but birds--and they discovered that it was
possible to detect the plasmodia responsible for avian malaria, under the
microscope, in the body of the mosquito. That was a first major insight, that
the mosquito was in some way implicated. But then they went further and they
followed the process by which it changed various phases in the body of the
insect and reproduced, and they traced the migration of the parasite to the
biting apparatus of the mosquito. And then they were able to take healthy
birds and have mosquitoes, who were known to be infected, feast on them, and to
produce malaria experimentally on birds. </p>
<p>And, so, in 1898, if
you were reading this correspondence, there&#39;s a eureka moment in which Ross
announces that he&#39;s discovered the mosquito theory of transmission, and proved
it. And he claims that he feels like Captain Cook, the explorer, or possibly
like Napoleon. And he was not, however, a naturalist, and he didn&#39;t know about
the speciation of mosquitoes, and the mosquitoes he described, he described as
dappled, brindled or light brown. He didn&#39;t know about the species of <i>Anopheles
</i>mosquitoes. </p>
<p>It&#39;s at this point
that we should mention then a second major figure--oops, anyway we&#39;ll see--it
doesn&#39;t matter--<em>Giovanni</em> Battista Grassi, who was the next
figure in the development of the mosquito theory of transmission, and he does
so for human beings. And what he does is he discovers that it&#39;s possible--in a
place called Capaccio he takes railroad workers, in the midst of a major
malaria outbreak in the summer, and he introduces one variable in their lives,
from a control group of railroad workers and the surrounding peasantry; and that
is that one group he has living from dusk until dawn in well-screened houses;
and this difference protecting them from the one factor, which is from the
bites of mosquitoes, prevents their being contracting malaria. This was one
place in which he did that. </p>
<p>And then he also did
a different experiment, which was to use quinine, which kills malaria parasites
in the open bloodstream. He gave it prophylactically to a series of workers,
as a control group, in a place like Ostia, during the summer malaria season,
and found that he could protect them as well from malaria by establishing a
chemical barrier between the mosquitoes and human beings. And then he took the
further step of actually taking mosquitoes who were known to have feasted on
people ill of malaria, and took them to a hospital in Rome known as the Santo
Spirito Hospital, where he had a volunteer on the second floor who was in a
room where at night they released hundreds of intentionally infected mosquitoes,
and a couple of weeks later they had their eureka moment when he had a spike
and a temperature of 104, and they knew that they had successfully transmitted
malaria by human experimentation to someone who had been healthy until
mosquitoes infected with the disease had been allowed to feast upon him. </p>
<p>So, this then happens
between 1898 and 1901. And this then is a powerful factor in the development
of tropical medicine. But it also leads to programs to combat malaria. Having
discovered the pathogen responsible to it, the plasmodia, and the vector,
female anopheles mosquitoes, we see the development of public health programs
to destroy the disease--either by attacking the plasmodia with chemical
therapy, that is, through quinine; or by killing mosquitoes, that is, vector
control--the idea of possibly being able to eradicate malaria. And next time
what I&#39;d like to do is to follow the practical application then of the
discoveries we&#39;ve talked about today, about the life cycle of plasmodia and of anopheline
mosquitoes, and see how that leads to the development of public health
strategies. And I&#39;d like to talk about how those strategies are being used in
the real world today to combat this crisis of this dreadful vector-borne
disease. </p>
