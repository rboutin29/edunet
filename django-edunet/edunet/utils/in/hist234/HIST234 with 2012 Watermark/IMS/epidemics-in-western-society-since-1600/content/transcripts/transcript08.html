<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay, well good morning, and we can get underway. So far, as you know, we&#39;ve
dealt with two major epidemic diseases, plague and smallpox. And we&#39;ll be
examining quite a number more, beginning next time with Asiatic cholera. But
our course, as you remember I explained in the beginning, isn&#39;t simply one
epidemic disease after another. There are also other themes that are very
important to us. One of those is already taking shape, I hope, in your minds
and in your section discussions, and that is the history of public health
strategies; that is, ways in which societies organize to defend themselves
against the incursions that we&#39;re discussing. </p>
<p>We&#39;ve noted the first
form of public health, which consisted of those draconian plague measures, and
we&#39;ll see that they aren&#39;t confined only to bubonic plague, but they&#39;ll be
cropping up again and again in the course of our lectures. And you&#39;ve also
seen that smallpox brought about a second major style of public health, and
that is vaccination, and clearly we&#39;ll be returning to that as well. So,
public health is a major theme of our class. And a third major theme is also
crucial, and that&#39;s the history of ideas, and especially medical ideas. </p>
<p>So, we&#39;re
examining--one way of thinking about the course might be as an examination of
the career of what might be called scientific medicine, from humoralism through
several subsequent incarnations, down to the modern biomedical paradigm. In
later weeks we&#39;ll be looking at the germ theory of disease, at the debate about
contagionism and anti-contagionism. We&#39;ll be looking at the idea of tropical
medicine as a concept, and its implications. But this morning I want to take
another step by looking at a very crucial moment in the development of modern
medicine that took place, this development, between the French Revolution and
the middle of the nineteenth century, and it occurred in Paris, and is
universally known as the Paris School of Medicine. </p>
<p>This is a development
that was so important that sometimes it&#39;s referred to, maybe just a shade
glibly, as the moment of transition from medieval medicine to modernity. So,
our plan this morning is to look at this through first understanding major new
developments that were a series of shocks to the old humoral system of
Hippocrates and Galen. We&#39;ll see firstly some crises there. The second thing
we&#39;ll need to do is to look at positive precursors to the developments of Paris.
</p>
<p>As is so often the
case, it&#39;s misleading to think of the Paris School as suddenly appearing out of
nowhere. It had its bases intellectually and institutionally in a series of
prior developments. Those were preconditions that made it possible. Then we&#39;ll
look at what actually happened in Paris, roughly in the period 1794 to 1848;
the establishment of a new concept, a new embodiment of scientific medicine.
And this is a step that laid the preconditions for the germ theory that came
later in the century, for reasons we&#39;ll be discussing. And then the last thing
we&#39;ll do this morning is to look at the achievements, but also the limitations,
of what happened in Paris. </p>
<p>Now, in our career in
scientific medicine, we&#39;ve noted the first embodiment in antiquity. We&#39;ve
talked a bit about Hippocrates and his establishment of the importance of
naturalistic causes of disease instead of magic explanations; the rejection, if
you like, of religious or demonic interpretations of disease. In Hippocrates&#39;
hands, disease was clearly a natural phenomenon with naturalistic causes. We
should remember that this had an importance for medical epistemology. By
epistemology, I mean what do we know, and how can we know it, what&#39;s the basis
of knowledge, what are its sources? </p>
<p>We know that
Hippocrates and his corpus of writings established or embodied a medical
epistemology that held that knowledge in matters of healing is derived from
direct observation, at the individual patient&#39;s bedside. It&#39;s therefore often
referred to, as this first incarnation of a scientific medicine, as bedside
medicine. The locus, the source of knowledge, is at the bedside, through
empirical observation. We know too that this had as a corollary an educational
program. How do you learn medicine? You do so by apprenticeship to doctors on
their rounds to the domestic bedside where the essential task was to observe. </p>
<p>Then we saw another
development in scientific medicine, and this was in the form of Galenism. This
is to say that humoralism in Galen&#39;s writings was primarily concerned with the
ancient texts, texts that Galen considered essentially infallible. They were
to be enhanced, and he thought that he was the person ideally suited to do that
work, but they could never be overthrown. There was no possibility of a
conceptual paradigm shift, or conceptual revolution. This was what was called
library medicine. In other words, for Galen there was a new understanding of
medical epistemology. </p>
<p>Knowledge was derived
from considering the ancients, from a careful study of their texts. So, it&#39;s
textually based medicine. And it had, of course, an educational corollary.
And indeed until 1794 in France, for example, medical education consisted
primarily of lectures on the classics, delivered in Latin, and of a program of
reading the ancients in the original languages. This, then, was library
medicine. </p>
<p>The whole humoral
system, as we&#39;ve been looking at it, underwent a series of shocks and
intellectual criticisms. It didn&#39;t seem to fit all of the evidence that
emerged. Let&#39;s look at a couple of these shocks to the humoral system. One
we&#39;ve already mentioned, and that was the great work of William Harvey and the
circulation of the blood. Now, this meant Harvey&#39;s work, although he didn&#39;t
take the step of rejecting Galenism, nonetheless it&#39;s true that his work
undermined Galen&#39;s anatomy, and it undermined humoral physiology. So, this was
ultimately, then--Harvey&#39;s discoveries were incompatible with the medical
thinking of his time. </p>
<p>We&#39;ve mentioned also
that the chemical revolution, the work of people like Lavoisier, was extremely
important, and it was important in undermining humoralism. Because you know
that the humoral approach was based on a theory of the four elements or the
four humors, essentially on Aristotelian natural philosophy. Chemistry,
however, undermined the humoral elements, the four elements, and began to
replace them with a wholly different set, leading ultimately to the periodic table.
So, the whole basis of the four elements comes to be undermined by the chemical
revolution. </p>
<p>Indeed, there is a
development of what&#39;s called iatrochemistry, which is the view that health is
the balance of chemicals in the body, and that healing consists primarily of
finding the right chemical to correct the imbalance. So, medicine, in this
view, becomes reduced more to chemistry. An important figure in this is
Paracelsus, who lived from 1493 to 1541, and was known as &quot;the Martin Luther of
medicine,&quot; a Swiss healer and a rebel against Galenism. Indeed, he burned--he
boasted that he himself had burned the masters&#39; texts. He was a leading figure
in the development of iatrochemistry, which was particularly strong in the Low
Countries. He introduced a number of chemicals to medical science, such as
zinc and laudanum, or opium. </p>
<p>Another shock to the
system, of course, was the spirit behind the scientific revolution. The
scientific revolution was empirical. It was a democratic process, and it
rejected the cult of authority. Authority could be challenged by anyone&#39;s
observations and measurements. And this was ultimately incompatible with
Galen&#39;s system of worship of the Ancient texts. Then there was the experience
that we&#39;ve been looking at the last couple of weeks of epidemic diseases.</p>
<p>Epidemic diseases
created problems for humoral interpretations. How was it that so many people
in a single place and time had this marked imbalance in their humors? And
there came to be, alongside the Galenic system, the idea of contagion instead,
which was a non-humoral idea. Indeed, Fracastoro developed this strongly, and
it gained a wide purchase in popular culture, and the search came to be for
some agent responsible for epidemics, not humors, but perhaps a chemical. Even
some people postulated that it might be a living thing of some kind. </p>
<p>All of these were
severe criticisms for the humoral system. But although Galenism then had these
loose threads, if we might say, well before 1794, no consensus arose around an
alternative to replace it. We might make a distinction between medical science
also and medical practice; that is, the scientific basis of Galenism was
eroding. But until indeed the late nineteenth century, medical practice, what
physicians actually did at the bedside, remained traditional. So, we see critiques
of Galenism abounding, chipping away at its foundations. But there was no new
medical science that was robust enough to create a new medical practice. </p>
<p>Note also that when
we talk about the coming of the Paris School, a couple of things that we won&#39;t
be pointing to. This new revolution in medicine that occurred in Paris was not
based on some new development in the natural sciences. It wasn&#39;t based on a
technological breakthrough. It wasn&#39;t based on some path-breaking medical or
scientific discovery. So, let&#39;s look now, with that as the background, at this
new incarnation of medical science, the Paris School of Medicine, which was a
conceptual revolution in the understanding of disease. It marked a
transformation in medical epistemology--where is the source of medical
knowledge?--and also in medical education, and it led to a new position for the
regular physician in society, with new claims to authority, in competition with
various competitors, like homeopaths or members of various medical sects. </p>
<p>This new medicine
comes to be called hospital medicine. And there are a number of classic
studies, if you want to read further about it, that you&#39;ll be glad to know
aren&#39;t on the reading list; which I&#39;m not extending. But there are places
that, on a purely voluntary basis, I hope that you&#39;ll be going to read more
about it. One is the work of Erwin Ackerknecht, who&#39;s one of the founders of
the modern discipline of the history of medicine, and he wrote a work <i>Medicine
and the Paris Hospital</i>. Or there&#39;s my colleague here at Yale, John Harley
Warner, who&#39;s written <i>Against the Spirit of System</i>, which is a study in
particular of American physicians and students, and their experiences as they
made a medical and intellectual pilgrimage to Paris. </p>
<p>There&#39;s a famous book
by Michel Foucault called <i>The Birth of the Clinic</i><i>,</i> and I will
wish you luck with that particular work. It&#39;s one of the classic studies that
everyone refers to with regard to the Paris School and its importance. But let
me just tell you anecdotally that I&#39;ve read it I think four times. The first
time I read it in French and thought there was something wrong with my French.
So, I read it in English, and decided there was something also wrong with my
English. And then my third and fourth times I think I decided maybe there was
something wrong with Foucault. But I&#39;ll leave that for you to judge and make
your own decisions. In any case, it&#39;s one of the classics in the literature,
and it covers the ground we&#39;re dealing with this morning. </p>
<p>Well, what were the
sources of this new medicine? First, I would say there&#39;s an institutional
basis that made it possible, and that is the hospital. Hospitals already
existed, but not as places of treatment so much as safety nets or dumping
grounds for the aged, the incurable, the orphaned. The Industrial Revolution
and urbanization, however, radically increased the numbers of patients, and the
hospitals were often associated with philanthropy and the church. And Paris,
the great center of Western Europe, urban center of culture, also became the
locus for some of the most famous hospitals in Europe: the Hôtel-Dieu, the Charité and the Pitié, that we&#39;ll be
seeing in a moment. <br />
<br />
</p>
<p>And, so, for a second
then I think it&#39;s worth doing a little bit--taking you for a moment on a bit of
medical tourism. And in doing so, we go to the center of Paris, here, when we
see the location of the Hôtel-Dieu hospital,
here in the middle of the Seine, on the Ile de la Cité. The Hôtel-Dieu was perhaps
the oldest hospital in the world. It had a history of providing care on this
very site ever since the seventh century, and it was the largest general
hospital in Paris. And as you can see, it&#39;s located at the very center of the
city. This is its architectural plan. It was a very large structure. By the
end of the old regime in France, it had four great wards that could accommodate
4,000 patients, often sleeping several to a single bed. We can see another
picture of it. </p>
<p>This is a picture of
the entrance to the church and the hospital, taken in 1871, at the time of the
Paris Commune. And we can see its present-day structure. This is the great
courtyard of the Hôtel-Dieu. And I&#39;m
pointing it out to us because it&#39;s impossible to understand the Paris School of
Medicine and the new understanding of medical science without taking into
account the great hospitals of Paris that were its site and were crucial in the
development of its ideas. This is the Hôtel de la Charité, another one of the
great hospitals. And this is the Hospital de la Pitié. </p>
<p>So, the new hospitals
become places of instruction, under the control or auspices of a centralized
state. They&#39;re large, and have an enormous array of patients, and they&#39;re
dedicated--and this was crucial--to furthering scientific knowledge. Indeed,
they&#39;re more dedicated at this stage to furthering knowledge than to treating
people. </p>
<p>Then there are--if
that&#39;s an institutional basis then, the great hospitals--there are also
philosophical origins for the Paris School. The first is the Enlightenment,
with its questioning of authority, its skepticism, its empiricism. And then
I&#39;d like to turn to John Locke in particular, the great figure from 1632 to
1704, and his crucial work, the essay &quot;Considering Human
Understanding,&quot; of 1690, which some people regard as so important that
they place it at the very beginning of the whole movement of the
Enlightenment. Well, Locke postulated, as you already know, that the mind at
birth was a blank slate or <i>tabula rasa</i>. And his idea was what&#39;s called
philosophic sensualism; that is, that ideas and knowledge gained by the mind
are not innate but are derived entirely from sense impressions and reflections
on those impressions. This is the cover of the &quot;Essay Concerning Human
Understanding.&quot; </p>
<p>So, we have in Locke
then a radical idea of epistemology. The source of knowledge--hence the word
sensualism--is the five senses used to conduct a rigorous examination of
nature. Locke, also in his epistemology, not only saw the source of knowledge,
but set rigorous limits to what we can know, putting God, for example, beyond
the realm of knowledge, and establishing rigorous steps for being certain of
the things that we can know. Then there&#39;s another very important figure, and
this is someone we&#39;ve also mentioned before, who&#39;s becoming an old friend to
us. This is Thomas Sydenham of the seventeenth century, who was in fact a
close friend of John Locke and is called variously the English Hippocrates, the
father of English medicine. </p>
<p>Well, Sydenham was
politically a radical. He was a Puritan, a left-wing Protestant, who rebelled
against the Crown in the Civil War in England, and served, in fact, as an
officer in Cromwell&#39;s Army. He was also radical in his medical ideas. His
prescription for medical practice was rooted in the idea of sensualism. He
called for a rigorous return to observation of the patient, and he himself
called for the idea of abandoning theory and all pre-established medical
systems. The advance of medical knowledge would proceed by a systematic comparison
of case by case, setting aside the classics and setting aside general system
and general theory. </p>
<p>Oddly, Sydenham did
not wholly reject humoral medicine. But his ideas, in fact we could say,
were--and his practice--were still influenced by Hippocrates. But what he did
was to suspend ideas of general theory and return from the texts to direct
observation of the patient at the bedside. In some sense he was skipping over
Galen and returning to Hippocrates. He believed that the physician should trust
his own independent reasoning based on experience. He distrusted bookish
learning and university education--although he himself had attended Oxford--and
in return he was scorned by the medical and academic elite of his day. </p>
<p>Sydenham gave his
attention also to epidemic diseases. He studied smallpox, malaria,
tuberculosis and syphilis. Indeed, he would be a good figure for talking about
the impact that epidemic disease had on the undermining of humoralism and the
rise of a new scientific paradigm. He&#39;s known also for his work on hysteria,
and on gout, from which he himself was a great sufferer. In his work on
malaria, he also did something radically new, of reaching the conclusion that
he was dealing not with a humoral imbalance in general, but rather with a
specific disease entity. Indeed, he thought he was one of the harbingers of
the idea that diseases are all specific entities, rather than a single
dyscrasia, and he suggested that the time might come when they would be
classified in the manner of Linnaeus. He even wrote, &quot;All diseases ought
to be reduced to certain determinate kinds, with the same exactness as we see
it done by botanic writers in their treatises on plants.&quot; </p>
<p>Sydenham also was new
and radical in sometimes embracing the idea of contagion in his dealing with
epidemic disease. He wrote, for example, of the plague: &quot;Besides the
constitution of the air, there must be another previous circumstance to produce
the plague; namely the effluvia or seminum from an infected person, either immediately
by contact or immediately by some pestilential matter conveyed from some other
place.&quot; So, we see here a radically different idea. And he wrote a work,
a famous work, of 1676 called the <em><i>Observationes Medicae</i></em>, a revealing title
stressing medical observation. </p>
<p>Sydenham is famous
for introducing a number of practices into medicine, as well. He popularized
the use of quinine for malaria. He introduced opium into his practice. He
used cooling drinks and fresh air to treat fevers, rather than bloodletting,
and he introduced the cool regimen that we talked about for smallpox. Often,
he wrote, the best advice he could give a physician was to do nothing at all. </p>
<p>There was another
important philosophical influence, and that&#39;s this man, Pierre Cabanis, a
French <i>philosophe</i> who lived from 1757 to 1805. He was a physician, a
physiologist and medical philosopher. He was also an administrator of the
hospitals in Paris, and an early supporter of the French Revolution. But the
point I want to stress today was that in terms of medical philosophy he was a
sensualist. He believed that all mental processes are derived from the five
senses, and therefore in medicine the source of knowledge should not be ancient
texts but direct observation of patients. </p>
<p>So, that was--these
series then we&#39;ve seen institutional foundations and philosophical ones. I now
want to look at a third major foundation for the coming of the Paris School,
and this is the French Revolution itself. This is a famous painting of Eugène Delacroix of &quot;Liberty
Leading the People.&quot; You get the idea. What I want to stress
is a general feature of the French Revolution, that it was an opportunity to
wipe the slate clean, that it marked a radical new departure that facilitated
opposition to older authorities, and in specific nature to medical
corporations. It was also a time of French nationalism which urged on that
instruction should take place no longer in Latin but in the vernacular; that
is, in French. </p>
<p>There are also some
other specific features that made the French Revolution an important moment for
the development of a new medicine. One was, of course, that this was a time of
continuous warfare--from 1792, for a whole generation, until 1815--and
therefore there was an urgent practical need for physicians and for adequate
hospitals. It was a time of reform in the structure of medicine as a career
and a profession, and also of medical training. </p>
<p>It was a time too,
during the French Revolution, when the hospitals were reformed, centralized. There
was only one patient to a bed. They were state-owned and centralized. And the
wards became specialized--and this was crucial for the development of new
medical ideas--specialized according to the type of patient being treated.
These hospitals were no longer devoted to hospice and orphanage care, but
rather they became scientific institutions. </p>
<p>Patients were seen as
having a service to perform in the name of science and the advancement of
knowledge. Their bodies were made radically accessible to physicians and
students, both in life, and very crucially also after death in terms of
post-mortem examinations. Alive, the patient was a source of knowledge, as
physicians conducted physical examinations to study the signs and symptoms of
disease with rigor and precision. In death, their lesions were a source of
knowledge to pathologists, to surgeons who practiced their techniques, and to
anatomists and physiologists. </p>
<p>Well, the reform of
medical education meant that the locus of medicine was entirely clinical and
practical on hospital wards. You were trained as a physician, a medical
student, for three years, followed by an internship. And the Faculty of
Medicine in Paris now consisted of full-time professors, appointed by
competitive examination. And the French Revolution was important for its
values, stressing a meritocracy by the encouragement of ability instead of
privilege, birth and cronyism, and by a new democratic spirit that provided a
new dynamism and a world of competition. The new banners inscribed--the new
mottos of the medical profession were words such as &quot;reform,&quot; &quot;progress,&quot; &quot;observation&quot;<i>
</i>and &quot;precision.&quot; </p>
<p>What, then--those are
the preconditions--what was the substance of the Paris School of Medicine? And
here we see an extraordinary development where one city becomes the world
center of a new medicine. Paris was dubbed &quot;the universal faculty of medicine.&quot;
Its students and physicians came from all over the world to observe and to be
trained in Paris. Its work was concentrated in the Latin Quarter, that became
a sort of mecca for scientists and students from everywhere. Indeed, large
numbers of Americans made a pilgrimage to Paris to study with its masters, to
bring their ideas back to this country, and to place themselves in a position
to raise their fees because of the prestige which went with the time spent on
the wards of Paris. </p>
<p>So, in medicine, the
rise of the Paris clinic was said to mark a time of transition between the
medical Middle Ages and the beginning of a modern era. This was hospital
medicine, based on radical empiricism and opposed to abstract theory. The
great motto in Paris was <i>Peu lire et beaucoup voir</i>, read little but see
a lot. The basis of knowledge was said to be facts, grouped into great facts,
with linkages established by statistics, and no room for abstractions, apart
from the facts and their mathematical linking. This was observation-based
medicine. But it went beyond the medicine of Hippocrates in that--this is a
picture of René Laennec, represented
on a Paris ward, and what he&#39;s doing is conducting a physical examination of
the patient. Laennec, in fact, invented--he was famous for his studies of
masses of tubercular patients. </p>
<p>It&#39;s important to
know that tuberculosis was rampant in nineteenth century Paris, and René Laennec had the
opportunity to examine and treat thousands of patients with tuberculosis, which
he himself contracted, and he died from it in the end, at a young age. Well,
he invented--and this is the point I wanted to stress at the moment--the
stethoscope in 1816, so that the modern physical examination became more one--not
just observing the patient, but examining him or her, and the stethoscope
became a hallmark and symbol of the Paris School. Indeed, it became a symbol
in nineteenth-century medicine. </p>
<p>Here we see--this was
the monaural stethoscope of the type used by Laennec. It may have been
important also that he was a musician, and specifically a flutist, and that may
have influenced his method of proceeding. This is the precursor of what is
more familiar to us. He introduced the procedures of oscillation and
percussion. He tapped and listened to the internal sounds of the body, and he
described them, what he heard in the lungs of his tuberculosis patients, as
rales, rhonchi, and all the other modern terms used to describe the modern
sounds that he heard. </p>
<p>Now, this vast number
of patients on the wards was crucial. A professor of medicine in Paris might
examine some 5,000 patients a year. And crucially, they produced a new concept
of disease; that is, disease specificity. Diseases were thought to be discrete
entities that could be classified. This is the beginning really of nosology,
which is the classification of disease entities, labeled variously
tuberculosis, smallpox, et cetera. Rather than the humoral idea that there&#39;s
just one disease, the humoral imbalance or dyscrasia, now we have a Linnaean
type nosology or classification. </p>
<p>On wards--and this
was very important--another innovation of the Paris School was that the
symptoms observed on the ward, after the patient died--if the patient died, and
very many did--were correlated with the lesions in organs and tissues seen in
post-mortem examination. So, an important part of Paris then was the linking
of medicine with pathology, a physical examination with post-mortem autopsies.
There came to be another word then associated with Paris--a couple of words: localism,
diseases had a particular location in the body; solidism, which set them apart
from the fluids that were the humors. Instead the location of diseases was in
solid organs and tissues. </p>
<p>Now, the main
diseases in Paris at the time were pulmonary TB, pneumonia, typhoid, heart
disease, puerperal fever, cholera. With these discrete entities now being
classified, we also see the rise of medical specialties. So, Paris was
important in moving beyond the general practitioner to create specialties of
internal medicine, psychiatry, geriatric medicine, pediatrics, pathological
anatomy, venereology. And there was a new notion of medical education; that
is, lectures were still given, but the main place of learning was the hospital
ward where famous professors, like Laennec himself, or Pierre Louis, conducted
their rounds with a retinue of hundreds. Then there was the autopsy table,
also in the hospital, where observation and ideas, based on the ward, were
confirmed or not. </p>
<p>The new medical
education was practical instruction, and it was hands on, with training on the
ward from day one. And the students who attended, attended year round, with no
vacation, and there was a roll call for attendance. Remember, this was
introduced at the time of the revolution and then under Napoleon. And under
the Empire, professors even had ranks and wore uniforms. So, the practitioners
were doctors. But there was also a new licensing system, and students were
encouraged to learn through their senses, through seeing, hearing and
touching. This was sensualism not only in theory, but we might call it applied
sensualism, with a rejection of dogma, of theory and of authority simply as
authority. </p>
<p>Note too that there
was not an integration into this of the basic sciences. This was medical
science in a sense on its own, without what we would now--they called the basic
sciences accessory sciences. Now, the weak aspect of the Paris School though
was its therapeutics. This was a medical revolution in terms of medical
science. It was less revolutionary in terms of its therapeutics. The new
understanding of disease did not lead automatically to improved treatment for
the patient. Indeed, visitors from Britain and the United States often
expressed severe moral reservations about what they observed going on in the
Paris clinics. There was said to be little concern to alleviate suffering or
to preserve life.</p>
<p>Knowledge and its
advancement were what counted most. The patient, some visitors said, was an
object to be observed, as in a Natural History museum; more to serve science
than to recover. One American said, in fact, that a French version of <i>Uncle
Tom&#39;s Cabin </i>ought to be written about hospital patients on the wards of
Paris. And Eugène Sue, the Charles
Dickens of France, who wrote the famous work <i>The Mysteries of Paris</i>, did
a caricature of Pierre Louis, one of the heroes of the Paris School, who
appears as Dr. Griffon; and in Dr. Griffon, in the story, tells his students on
the rounds, on the ward of the hospital, that the lesions that they&#39;re
observing--that is, the symptoms--they can soon look forward to seeing when the
patient dies. Griffon declares that a patient is a human sacrifice on the altar
of science. </p>
<p>So, the Paris clinic
was also sometimes described by visitors as a theater, with patients as stage
props, and where surgeons saw human bodies as a means to greater manual
dexterity. Physicians and their students were not taught that their primary
mission was to heal, but rather to advance science. Treatment remained what it
had been for a long time. Therapy--we can see one of the lynchpins was still
venous section or bleeding by leeches. </p>
<p>Here we see a
picture, very widespread on the Paris wards, where hundreds-of-thousands of
leeches were imported monthly by these hospitals. And indeed they discovered
also, made a medical discovery, how do you get a leech to bite? Well, I can
tell you the answer to that. What you can do is you can wrap the poor thing in
a towel and soak the towel in wine or vinegar, which irritates it enormously
and makes it bite the next thing that it can reach. </p>
<p>So, the therapeutics
then were traditional and not different from what humoral physicians had been
doing for centuries. The strengths of the Paris School were in diagnosis,
pathology, classification, surgery and anatomy. Leading figures: Laennec,
Pierre Louis, Pierre Cabanis, Claude Bernard. But this stimulated imitation in
other countries. In England, St. Thomas Hospitals and Guy&#39;s Hospital in
London; in Austria, the Vienna School of Medicine was directly influenced by
Paris; and in the U.S., our own country, the linking of the Harvard Medical
School with Mass. General Hospital was directly based on the idea that had
originated in Paris. </p>
<p>But by mid-century,
the dynamism of Paris was on the wane, and it had to do particularly with
therapeutics. There was a therapeutic pessimism. All of the statistical
methods of the Paris School revealed that standard medical practices were of
doubtful efficacy, and tremendous advances in medical knowledge had done little
to advance therapeutics. Medical science and medical practice were quite
distinct. So, it&#39;s in the second half of the nineteenth century that we&#39;ll be
looking to yet, very soon, another incarnation of scientific medicine, when
scientific medicine moves from France to Germany, and from the hospital ward to
the university and to the laboratory. Then we&#39;ll see a new epistemology that
stresses the laboratory bench as the source of knowledge, and we&#39;ll talk about
the coming of laboratory medicine and experimental medicine as a paradigm
shift. </p>
<p>But all of that would
not have been possible, and we wouldn&#39;t have the coming of the germ theory of
disease, if it hadn&#39;t been for the idea of specificity and classification that
were developed in Paris between 1794 and the middle of the nineteenth century.
And next time we&#39;ll turn to another epidemic disease--and this is a timely one
as we&#39;re moving into the nineteenth century--and that is Asiatic cholera.</p>
