<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Okay, well let&#39;s begin. And, as you know, in our class one of the topics, or
themes, that we&#39;re considering is intellectual history. And lurking in the
background, of course, is the big question of medicine itself and what it is.
What is medical science? What does it mean to have a medical science? Well,
this morning we&#39;ll be considering that. Is medical science purely the
technical application of neutral knowledge? Or should we think of it as a
cultural institution, also, built by dominant social groups in society, that in
some way may reflect their worldview, sometimes may embody their prejudices,
and may promote their interests? And at least we should ask the question, if
we accept the biomedical paradigm of disease, what are the implications of that
acceptance? What are the costs? What are we giving up? </p>
<p>So, that&#39;s the big
issue. And today what I&#39;d like to do is to look at a subset of the bigger
problem, and this is the medical specialization that&#39;s known as &quot;tropical
medicine.&quot; It emerged in the 1890s, in a period, that is, of--it gained
rapidly enormous prestige and influence, and is still a major subfield in
medicine. The discipline thus far has undergone three periods in its history.
The first is the one that we&#39;re going to be concentrating on this morning, and
that&#39;s the period from roughly the 1890s until more or less the First World
War. That marks the real heyday of tropical medicine, the time when it was the
cutting edge of medical science, when it made a series of major discoveries,
and served the most obvious political purposes. </p>
<p>It was followed in
its history by a second period, that lasts more or less from World War I until
the 1970s, the next half-century of tropical medicine. And during this period
the discipline loses a lot of its scientific momentum. Tropical medicine came
to be confined essentially to parasitology, and at this period, the dynamism in
medical science moved instead to microbiology and such offshoots as immunology,
and that boosted such major developments as antibiotics and a series of
effective vaccines, and that attracted the lion&#39;s share of research funds. So,
tropical medicine, in the period from the First World War to the 1970s, made
relatively few major, major discoveries. </p>
<p>Then, after World War
II, and accelerating from the 1970s, we see a third phase, ushered in by such
things as decolonization and a new attention to public health in the Third
World, and with it a new influx of research funds through the World Health
Organization and powerful foundations like the Rockefeller and MacArthur
Foundations. Well, what I want to do this morning is to look critically at
tropical medicine. And by that I don&#39;t mean for or against. What I want to do
instead is to look at why it arose as a discipline when it did. What interests
did it serve? What were its implications? And I&#39;m going to argue that
tropical medicine, and particularly in this formative early period before the
First World War, was clearly socially constructed. </p>
<p>This is a period that
coincides with the high tide of colonial expansion, the age of the scramble for
Africa. And tropical medicine gave expression to an imperial view of the
world, and it marked the relationship, in medical terms, between Western
Europe, on the one hand, and Asia and Africa on the other, and between the
United States and Latin America. As a discipline, it served as a major
instrument also in promoting European expansion overseas, and American hegemony
in the Americas. In its applications, and in the policies it promoted,
tropical medicine was not only value-neutral science; it was also an instrument
of power, and we need to bear that in mind. </p>
<p>Now, the emergence of
tropical medicine marked a transition, a transformation, from something that
had preceded it, and that I hope won&#39;t be confusing. But from the middle of
the eighteenth century, more or less, until the closing decade of the
nineteenth century, there had been an older tradition that can be summarized
under the label of &quot;diseases of the tropics.&quot; And there were a couple of
classic statements of this older tradition. One was a work, an important work,
by James Lind, an eighteenth-century physician, who wrote &quot;An Essay on Diseases
Incidental to Europeans in Hot Climates,&quot; and this was built on the
experience of Europeans in the West Indies. And then there was another work by
James Johnson called &quot;The Influence of Tropical Climates on European
Constitutions,&quot; built on the experience of Europeans in India. </p>
<p>What these works, and
other ones of their kind, meant in the expression &quot;diseases of the tropics&quot; was
something particular. They meant that in the colonial world--in, that is, the
area of hot climate, as it was expressed at the time--Europeans were subject to
special diseases as challenges, that arose as a result of conditions peculiar
to warm climates, and to the resulting conditions of temperature, humidity and
local ecology. Under those conditions, the diseases that would afflict
Europeans were not, however, different in nature from those familiar at home.
The diseases of hot countries were heightened in their virulence, perhaps, and
the constitutions of white people were now subjected to new and unfamiliar
stresses that made them peculiarly vulnerable in these climates to disease.
But the issue was simply--in the era, should we say, of diseases of the
tropics--was simply one of degree, rather than kind. </p>
<p>The diseases of the
tropics were simply intense variants of familiar disease processes. And there
was an educational corollary to that, which was that physicians who had studied
general medicine, in European medical schools, were fully equipped to treat the
entire spectrum of human diseases wherever they occurred. Diseases of the
tropics weren&#39;t a special category. They were simply heightened versions of
familiar maladies. In other words, the concept of diseases of the tropics
presupposed a universality of a single medical discipline that viewed the diseases
of the tropical world as posing problems of degree, but not of a thoroughly
different kind. </p>
<p>We should also say
that this idea of diseases of the tropics already did have embodied in it some
troubling and important questions that had to do with a colonial or imperial
and racial view of the world. European bodies, the concept presupposed, were
different in some way from those of Asians and Africans. They weren&#39;t intended
for the conditions prevailing in the colonies, and so the question was, were the
tropics in fact inhabitable for Europeans? You can see this in expressions
like &quot;darkest Africa,&quot; &quot;teeming Asia&quot;--those imply dangerous places--and even
more the expression of &quot;the white man&#39;s grave.&quot; </p>
<p>And, so, the question
was whether settling in the tropics was going to be possible. Was it simply
that Europeans needed a period of seasoning--another term of the time--or
acclimatization, after which they&#39;d be stress-hardy and able to survive in
these new settings? Physicians who dealt with diseases of the tropics thought
of themselves as performing an indispensable service, one that was useful to
European states, and especially to explorers, travelers, settlers, colonial
administrators, and of course sailors and soldiers. The service was to provide
assistance and advice during the time of acclimatization, advice on exercise,
diet, clothing and housing; in short, everything that new arrivals would need
to protect themselves from the rigors of the new environment. But the 1890s
marked a transition to something different--from this view of diseases of the
tropics, to something that sounds subtly different, but was profoundly so, and
that is tropical diseases and tropical medicine. </p>
<p>Now, what was implied
in this transition, this transformation? It was a vision of the world in which
Asia and Africa, for Europeans, or possibly Latin America, for U.S. citizens,
were conceived in a really charged fashion as harboring disease that were
conceptually different from other diseases, that could not be treated by physicians
who had graduated from European medical schools unless they had undergone
special postgraduate training. And the implication too was a different form of
hygiene. And there was a work that was a foundational text for this new
medical specialty, one of the most influential medical works of the whole of
the nineteenth century, and one that had enormous influence on the relations of
the metropolitan powers to their colonial dependencies. This work was by this
man, a British physician named Patrick Manson, who came to be known as the
father of tropical medicine. </p>
<p>The work that caused
the stir was called--it&#39;s an enormous, fat volume--entitled <i>Tropical
Diseases: A Manual for the Diseases of Warm Climates</i>. And it was written
in 1898, which isn&#39;t an accident. And it wasn&#39;t also an accident that the
father of tropical medicine was British, or that Britain became the world
center of the new discipline, Britain at the time being the world&#39;s leading
imperial power. Now, what were the background conditions that promoted the
emergence of this whole new medical sub-discipline? A first, as we said, was
Britain&#39;s position as a great colonial power. There were others, as well, that
lay behind this new medical specialism. One was something we&#39;ve already dealt
with, and that is the germ theory of disease and the triumph of contagionism
over anticontagionism.</p>
<p>The germ theory had a
number of possible implications. One was the idea, as we&#39;ve seen, of clinching
the concept of disease specificity. And tropical medicine was built on the
premise that some diseases lurking in Africa and Asian now needed new
classifications, belonging in special categories, and that to understand
them--and here was another of its implications--you needed physicians who were
trained at special institutions, and had a specialized curriculum, and that
they could be dealt with by specific special remedies and measures of hygiene
that were different from those that had been successful in bringing about a
mortality revolution in Europe. </p>
<p>As you&#39;ll remember
when we examined the theories of Max van Pettenkofer, the germ theory marked
the end of an alternative approach to medicine, one that had flourished at
mid-century, particularly in continental Europe, but was intellectually
vanquished by the laboratory methods of bacteriology, and later parasitology.
This was the idea of social medicine, associated with a radical German
physician, Rudolf Virchow. For social medicine, medicine was a collective
enterprise in which it was important for physicians to treat not only
individual patients, but society as a whole, dealing with issues of sanitary
conditions, poverty, nutrition, social justice. Well, the germ theory of
disease was a setback for social medicine, and I&#39;m going to argue that tropical
medicine went even a step further in the turn from that direction. It argued
that in the tropical world the chief problem--and we&#39;re talking with the period
down to World War I--the chief problem was to preserve the health of European
settlers. </p>
<p>As a discipline,
until much later in its life, tropical medicine largely ignored the general
health of indigenous societies. This also came to mean something somewhat
sinister, when the logic was applied to the global north and south, and
black/white relationships. It seemed to suggest that the bodies of Africans
and teeming Asians were medically dangerous, that they were the reservoirs for
diseases that posed serious new threats for Europeans. And there was an
implication, a possible strategy for hygiene, and that was that perhaps the
best way forward was for Europeans and indigenous peoples to be segregated in
their housing arrangements, that Europeans should live in the tropical world in
special enclaves where the latest prophylactic measures would be applied. Whereas
natives, or indigenous peoples, could be left as they had been found. </p>
<p>Alternatively, if you
read some of the literature produced by works of European writers such as
Somerset Maugham, you&#39;d see that the Europeans were advised to take to the
hills during the dangerous summer months, leaving dangerous natives behind.
But we shouldn&#39;t forget that tropical medicine, at the turn of the century, was
also where the scientific action and excitement in medical science were taking
place. Beyond the germ theory of disease, tropical medicine embodied the
various latest developments, and above all the new science of parasitology.
And it attracted some of the leading figures, indeed, in the development of
microbiology to enter this new discipline. This was true, for example, of
Robert Koch, who came, made a voyage, to Italy to study parasitology in the
form of malaria, and then set off for the colonial world. Pasteur at this time
had just died, but his institute saw affiliates or satellite institutes set up at
Saigon, at Tunis, Algiers, in the 1890s, all preaching the new discipline of
tropical medicine. And Pasteur&#39;s most famous and able disciple, Émile Roux, became a
specialist in this new discipline. </p>
<p>To understand it, we
need to remember two major breakthroughs. The first was by Patrick Manson in
1883. At that time, he discovered something that was radically new. He was
dealing with the disease of elephantiasis, and he found that the filarial worm
that causes it is transmitted by mosquitoes; the first example of a vector
borne disease transmission. This was epoch-making in that respect. And it was
also a movement from bacteria or--though it wasn&#39;t known at the time--viruses,
to more complex life forms, the interaction of humans with biologically more
sophisticated protozoa or helminths or worms, and with insect vectors.
Diseases could now be seen to be part of a much more complicated process, and
with complicated life forms. </p>
<p>Then there was,
following this, the establishment of the mosquito theory of transmission for
malaria, which took place during the end of the decade of the 1890s, with two
figures, who were working independently of each other, but in 1898 established
that malaria was a parasitical disease, transmitted by certain species of mosquitoes.
So, malaria--which is a disease that we&#39;ll be dealing with after the spring break--was
of decisive importance in the establishment of tropical medicine, and malaria
was the disease that was at its heart and its center. </p>
<p>The two people were
in Italy--and we&#39;ll be coming back to this in a couple of weeks, when we resume
classes--in Italy there was Giovanni Battista Grassi, who made a very elegant
demonstration, and a very convincing one, that human malaria was transmitted by
mosquitoes. And he did so by experiments in which he introduced just one
variable in the exposure, during the warm summer months, of large populations
to biting insects. He protected, by screening, or later by chemical means,
select groups of people, while everyone around them was falling ill of
malaria. They lived in exactly the same conditions as those around them,
except for one variable; that they weren&#39;t subject to the bites of flying
insects. And thereby he established that it was indeed insects, mosquitoes,
and certain types of mosquitoes; we&#39;ll be returning to that. Not all
mosquitoes, just anophelene mosquitoes, and certain species of them, that
transmitted the disease of malaria. </p>
<p>At the same time,
Ronald Ross, a British physician in India, was working instead with malaria
among the avian--that is, birds--avian malaria, where he demonstrated that it
too was transmitted by the bites of mosquitoes. And he argued, by analogy,
that human malaria was probably transmitted by mosquitoes as well. Now, this
was the age of a ferocious imperial rivalry, and Ross was the first British
scientist to discover the pathogen of a major disease, and he became a national
icon, the British answer to Pasteur or Koch. He won the Nobel Prize, and along
with Manson became one of two decisive figures in the founding of the
discipline of tropical medicine. </p>
<p>It was quite
interesting that there was an extraordinary collaboration between Manson and
Ross in India, where Ross wrote home what he was finding under his microscope
in India, and sent that back to Manson, who worked with him in suggesting new
directions for his research, and pushed him forward. So, in many ways the
discovery of the transmission of malaria belonged to Manson as well as Ross.
Well, in any case, malaria became the template, the ideal type of tropical
diseases. And in Manson&#39;s great work malaria occupies the largest amount of
space in the volume; the reasons being that it was a perfectly
vector-transmitted disease, a perfect parasitic disease. The plasmodium that
causes it, as we&#39;ll see in a couple of weeks, lives in a closed cycle, and
never exists free in the environment. Human beings don&#39;t happen upon it, and
the plasmodium has an extremely complicated lifecycle in both man and
mosquito. And the involvement of the mosquito also is scientifically
complicated; in other words, it was useful and important that Grassi was a
naturalist, was well as a physician. </p>
<p>Parasitology was
scientifically interesting, and intellectually so. To study malariology, one
needed to be a physician, but also an entomologist, a naturalist, and to have a
knowledge of the basic sciences. So, in 1898, for a whole generation,
parasitology replaced bacteriology as the cutting edge of medical science, and
it became the foundation of this new discipline, the rising discipline of
tropical medicine. Well, if that&#39;s how it emerges, what is the new
discipline? Manson defined tropical medicine in his great work. For him, it
was a special discipline, with diseases of an area defined by geography and
warm climate. Diseases there, he said, were unlike the diseases of the
temperate zone, and they require therefore a special medical discipline to deal
with them, and they require physicians who are specially trained in
post-graduate institutes. For that reason, tropical medicine emerged outside
of established medical schools, because it presupposed that physicians needed a
special curriculum and training to deal with diseases that were conceptually
different. </p>
<p>For example, in 1898,
in association with Joseph Chamberlain, the secretary of state for the
colonies--and you can see the role of the state in the promotion of this new
discipline, which was seen as important for the promotion of imperial
interests--and with the collaboration of Patrick Manson--there was founded the
London School of Tropical Medicine, with the specific intention of training
colonial medical officers in a new medical discipline; or very closely
associated was the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Another idea that
Manson said was essential to the new discipline was that tropical diseases were
caused not usually by bacteria but by more complex biological agents, with
complex lifecycles--protozoa and helmets--and that they were transmitted by
insect vectors, like mosquitoes or the tsetse fly. </p>
<p>Malaria had pride of
place. It was the ideal type to illustrate this, and it&#39;s the first disease
that Manson discusses in his work, and the disease he discusses at greatest
length. There were others of this type, like trypanosomiasis, which was African
sleeping sickness, which was caused by a parasite also that multiplies in the
human bloodstream and causes skin eruptions, anemia, chronic fever,
debilitation, lethargy and perhaps coma and death. It was transmitted by the
tsetse fly. Or there was schistosomiasis, caused by worms, with the snail as
its alternative host. Or leishmaniasis, or yellow fever--a viral infection, it
was later discovered--transmitted by a certain species of mosquito. </p>
<p>Well, so far, if you
were reading Manson&#39;s work, you would&#39;ve found the diseases I&#39;ve just mentioned
would be the ones that you would&#39;ve encountered, and there was a kind of
logical coherence to what they were. Diseases of places with warm climates,
transmitted by mosquitoes, caused not by bacteria but rather by more complex
life forms. But Manson then goes on. And what we see then is something of a
grab bag of diseases, that don&#39;t seem to have much of a scientific connecting
link. He mentions certain infectious bacterial diseases, some of them very familiar
to you already: bubonic plague, Asiatic cholera. He adds leprosy. He then
moves on to certain nutritional diseases: pellagra, which is caused by a
deficiency of niacin, if your diet consists not of wheat, but exclusively of
corn; or beriberi, or certain fungal diseases. And he even calls heatstroke a
tropical disease. </p>
<p>Another background
factor was institutional. Should we call it the institutionalization of this
new medical discipline? That is, it coincides with the high point of European
expansion. And this wasn&#39;t just a coincidence. It was an important instrument
in the domination of Africa and India, for instance, as important as gun
powder, enabling settlers to run mines and plantations, traders to travel,
administrators to govern, missionaries to preach, and soldiers to perform their
duties. For this reason, tropical medicine rapidly attracts governmental
backing, certainly in the British case, and institutional support and
assistance, from powerful economic interests, with concerns in the tropical
world. So, these institutions--in Britain we&#39;ve already talked about the
London School of Tropical Medicine, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,
the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. And it&#39;s embedded in a new
major journal, <i>The Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</i>, founded in
1895. </p>
<p>In France, we see the
Pasteur Institute; in the United States, such institutions as Johns Hopkins,
the Rockefeller Institute--and in particular its International Health
Division--the American Academy of Tropical Medicine, the American Society of
Tropical Medicine. And in the U.S., there were a couple of distinctive
features. One was the association of tropical medicine with the military, and
its leading figures, Walter Reed and William Gorgas, were in fact Army
officers. And it was in the Western hemisphere too that yellow fever replaced
malaria as the quintessential tropical disease. Some of the institutional
links can be seen in specific cases. An example that&#39;s recently been studied,
somewhat intensively, is the relationship of the Harvard Department of Tropical
Medicine to the colonial establishment of American power in Liberia, and in
particular the Firestone rubber plantations. And one can see there the clear
role of tropical medicine in promoting, if we like, the expansion of company
interests to extract resources from Liberia. This was an important
illustration of the uses that tropical medicine could be put to. </p>
<p>Well, what were
some--if that&#39;s what tropical medicine was as a discipline--what were some of
its implications, the implications of the worldview that it suggested? One is
that Africa, Asia and Latin America had something in common. This was an
artificial construction of European imagination. They were seen as reservoirs
of diseases that threatened Europe; Europe protected by the ramparts of
civilization and medical science. So, tropical medicine embodied, down to a
later period--certainly in this period down to the First World War--a
Eurocentric worldview. It was initially not responsive to specific locations,
as the tropics were artificially constructed as some single homogeneous place.
The natives of the tropics were also conceptualized as somehow dangerous,
harboring a vast array of lethal and highly contagious diseases. </p>
<p>Another implication
was that tropical medicine was concerned, in the early decades of the new
century, primarily overwhelmingly, with the help of Europeans--settlers,
administrators, missionaries and soldiers. There was little concern for the health
of the indigenous population. Indeed, the medical problems of the colonial
world that received attention were those that threatened Europeans, not the
health problems of the indigenous population. There was little attention to
the social and economic determinants of what we might today call Third World
problems of health, such as poverty, labor conditions, malnutrition. And there
was a neglect of major diseases that were often the major health problems of
the local population; say dysentery or gonorrhea, pneumonia, tuberculosis. </p>
<p>In recent years, in
fact, the blindness of the past has even resulted in new international
attention to a group of diseases, termed neglected tropical diseases, that
cause large-scale suffering such as poverty, low productivity, poor pregnancy
outcomes, but that for decades received little funding or attention from
policymakers. More ironically, a major issue, not considered after World War
I, as I said, was the impact of colonialism itself on the inhabitants of the
tropical world; that is, there was no attention to the way in which colonialism
itself contributed to environmental degradation; or promoted labor mobility in
unsanitary conditions; the way in which it promoted unplanned urbanization, low
educational attainment and poverty. </p>
<p>In fact, this period,
the first period of tropical medicine, from 1890 to just after the First World
War, was a time, one of the times, of the greatest epidemiological disasters in
the tropical world, with virgin soil epidemics, like smallpox and measles, and
the impact of what was called constructive imperialism. Railroads, roads,
trade, the transportation revolution, all enabled a pandemic of bubonic plague,
from the 1890s to 1920, and epidemic influenza, in 1918 and &#39;19, to occur in the
tropical world as well. Colonial wars, the involvement of the colonies in the
two world wars, had major disease impacts. So did the ecological impact of
railroads, factories, mines and plantations, and the recruitment of migrant
labor. So, just as in the case that we examined at greater length in your
reading of North America, disease played an important part in European
expansion. </p>
<p>Another implication
was public health policy. In Europe and North America, hygiene had given rise
to a broad-gauge sanitarian movement; one that reformed urban living conditions
through what we might call--and introducing a new jargon into our
course--horizontal programs of public health; that is, improvements that dealt
with living conditions across a broad spectrum of diseases. We&#39;ve seen that in
the sanitary movement. In the tropics, instead, metropolitan powers applied a
different vision of what was called vertical hygiene, or tropical hygiene. Now,
vertical campaigns of public health targeted instead single diseases, and they
were designed to protect, above all, Europeans against the most menacing
epidemics. That was tropical hygiene, then; something different from what was
practiced at the same time in Europe, was one of the implications. </p>
<p>Another implication
was a new prestige and authority for physicians. Ross and Koch, for example,
now became advisors to metropolitan governments, as did Manson. It meant
also--another implication was perhaps what we might call selective historical
amnesia. Many of the diseases identified as tropical had only recently been
present in Europe, and they weren&#39;t eradicated by temperature, but by broad
social and economic improvements. Malaria itself had been a European disease,
as you know, bubonic plague and cholera also. And then tropical medicine was
clearly an instrument of cultural and ideological hegemony. It was a
justification and rationale for colonialism. </p>
<p>Europeans felt that
they had health and civilization to offer, and that medicine was a means of
winning acceptance of the colonial presence. So, tropical medicine provided a
narrative of European progress, rationality and civilization overcoming
ignorance, superstition, darkness and the witchcraft of natives. Patrick
Manson was very explicit in his vision of the relationship of medicine and
empire. In a simple sentence he declared, &quot;I believe in the colonization
of the world by the white race.&quot; Well, that was the early period of
tropical medicine, between 1890, more or less, and just at a period after the
First World War. </p>
<p>Later we see a
transformation in the discipline. And I don&#39;t want to argue that it&#39;s the same
today as it was at the eve of the First World War. Radical changes in tropical
medicine came through a number of influences. One was the Second World War
itself, which was in part--and although there were deep contradictions involved
in it--it was in part, at least, a war against racialism. The discipline was
affected by decolonization, also by the rise of American hegemony after World
War II, with new priorities. It was influenced by globalization as an explicit
idea, and its implications that we all live in a single disease environment,
and that what happens in distant parts of the world are also vitally important
for the entire world population. And then there was--what was very important
also was a transformation in funding. </p>
<p>Because of those
factors, around and during the 1970s, The World Health Organization introduced
a major new emphasis on tropical diseases, and with it, in 1975, a major new
research project. The same happened with the Rockefeller Foundation in the
1970s, and then the MacArthur Foundation thereafterwards. And this meant a new
dynamism scientifically for the discipline of tropical medicine, and also with
that a major attention, reversing an earlier trend, with an emphasis on global
health programs that would be applicable everywhere, and that would include
major attention to the health of the population of indigenous peoples in areas
that had been neglected by an earlier phase of tropical medicine. </p>
<p>And, so, the entire
discipline, if we like, was transformed after World War II, and became
something that no longer embodied a colonial position, and no longer embodied
the idea that it was the bodies of Europeans that deserved privileged
protection, rather than the health of indigenous peoples in other parts of the
world. So, tropical medicine was a very important instrument of colonial power
in the period down to the First World War, and it was slowly transformed in the
inter-war period, and radically so after World War II. I hope you&#39;ll bear that
in mind as you think about the issue of what are the implications of medical
science; and what are its implications for the kinds of society and the world
that we live in? </p>
