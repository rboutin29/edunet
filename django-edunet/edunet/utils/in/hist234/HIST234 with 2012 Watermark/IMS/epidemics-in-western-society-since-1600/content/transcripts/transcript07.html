<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Now that we&#39;ve discussed smallpox and its impact on the human body--its
symptomatology--this morning I want to concentrate instead on the impact on history,
and I want to concentrate on three aspects in particular. The first part would
be to look at its impact in Europe. The second, and much more dramatic story,
is the impact that you&#39;re reading about in Elizabeth Fenn, which is what
happened with smallpox in the New World, and also in Australia and New
Zealand. The third task for the morning is to come to the very different
story, which is smallpox and the development of a public health strategy; in
this case, the development of the strategy of vaccine. </p>
<p>So, those are the
three topics I&#39;d like to deal with this morning. And, so, let&#39;s begin with the
impact of smallpox in Europe. Smallpox has a legend about it. The legend, it
goes like this. That it was brought back to Europe from the Middle East by
returning Crusaders in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. As you know, the
Crusades lasted from 1095 to 1291, and those are said to be, this time of
armies in movement and transit, to be the means of transmitting smallpox back
to Western Europe. </p>
<p>There&#39;s no reason for
us to accept the truth of that legend as accurate. But there is something
interesting about it. First, that there&#39;s some support, which is that Saint
Nicaise, who was a Crusader of the Order of Saint John, he had an unhappy
experience in the Middle East. He was captured and beheaded. But thereafter
he became the patron saint of smallpox sufferers. A cult of Saint
Nicaise--he&#39;s from Reims, in particular--spread across the continent, and
churches were devoted to him, and there were representations of this saint in
stained glass widows, in effigies, and statues like this. This is Saint
Nicaise at Reims Cathedral, Saint Nicaise and an angel. </p>
<p>There isn&#39;t any hard
evidence that smallpox did return with the Crusaders; although, we all know
that warfare is a time that favors the spread of infectious diseases, and it&#39;s
probably true that smallpox had already been present in Europe for centuries.
But there&#39;s something about this date, which is that what it tells us is not
when smallpox actually began, but when it first began to attract attention. In
any case, we know too that smallpox, although it was present in Europe during
the Crusades, the conditions at that time led to its beginning to have a more
important impact, that reached its highpoint in the late-seventeenth and then
throughout the eighteenth century. And that had to do with preconditions that
enabled it to flourish, preconditions associated with industrial development,
the commercialization of agriculture, and rapid, unplanned urbanization. </p>
<p>In the eighteenth
century, smallpox had clearly replaced plague as the greatest and most feared
killer of its time. Now, in its history, the fact that a sufferer--and we
mentioned this last time--who recovered possessed a robust, lifelong immunity
to this disease was important. No one was naturally infected twice with
smallpox. So, a typical pattern emerged in the cities of Europe, and that was
that smallpox became an ever-present disease that most people who survived
childhood had suffered. The adult population therefore possessed what we might
call an extensive herd immunity to smallpox as a disease. </p>
<p>So, it became an
endemic disease of childhood. But at intervals, perhaps every generation or
so, smallpox would erupt as a major epidemic among the general population. A
couple of factors came into play, to reinforce this pattern. Obviously not
every child contracted the disease, and so over time there&#39;d be a slow
accumulation of non-immune, susceptible adults who could fall ill of the disease.
It was also true that European cities in the early modern era were so unhealthy
that they sustained or expanded their population, not by growth from within,
but by a constant influx of people from without. Peasants driven off the land,
perhaps by hunger or warfare, or the search for work, failed harvests. And
these newcomers, in large numbers, to use contemporary medical jargon, were
immunologically na√Øve; that is, they were susceptible and added to the pool of
susceptibles in urban centers. </p>
<p>In every generation
or so, urban centers, whose children had already suffered smallpox as an
endemic childhood disease, suffered major epidemics among not only children but
young adults, adolescents and older people. So, smallpox is an example of a
disease--and we&#39;ll see malaria as another one--for which there&#39;s no simple
distinction between endemic and epidemic. Smallpox was both endemic year in
and year out, in Europe, and it was also epidemic sporadically every generation
or so. It thrived in crowded urban environments, with throngs of people, and
poorly vented houses and workshops. </p>
<p>Now, in the
eighteenth century, statistics are elusive. But smallpox is commonly
thought--and this is just a guesstimate--to have caused perhaps a tenth of all
deaths in the century in Europe, and a third of all deaths among children under
ten-years-of-age. Half the population of the continent is estimated to have
been scarred or disfigured by this disease. And smallpox was also the leading
cause of blindness. </p>
<p>Across Europe,
perhaps half-a-million--this is again only a guesstimate--people died annually
from this disease. In other words, it was the equivalent of--the largest city
in Europe at the time, in the eighteenth century, was Naples, with half a
million people--it was if a city of that size disappeared from this single
disease every year. The nineteenth century English poet and historian, Thomas
Babington Macaulay, wrote this about smallpox. &quot;The havoc of plague had
been far more rapid. But the plague has visited our shores only once or twice
in living memory. But smallpox was always there, filling the churchyards with
corpses, tormenting with constant fear all whom it had not yet stricken, and
leaving on those, whose lives it spared, the hideous traces of its power,
turning the babe into a changeling, at which the mother shuddered, and making
the eyes and cheeks of the betrothed maiden objects of horror to her
lover.&quot; </p>
<p>Two of the most
famous descriptions of smallpox in this century were those that described it as
&quot;the speckled monster&quot; and &quot;the most terrible of all the
ministers of death.&quot; Furthermore, like plague though, smallpox was an
airborne disease--unlike plague--but like influenza. And it was an affliction
that was universal, and had no predilection for any subset of the population,
such as the poor. It wasn&#39;t really in that sense a social disease. Even royal
families were scourged by smallpox in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. Famous sufferers and victims included King Louis XIV and Louis XV
of France; William II of Orange; Peter II of Russia; the Holy Roman Emperor,
Joseph I. </p>
<p>In England, smallpox
was even directly responsible for a dynastic change. It extinguished the House
of Stuart. The last Stuart heirs to the throne all died of smallpox, between
the death of Queen Mary, in 1694, and the death of eleven-year-old Prince
William, also from smallpox, in 1700. So this was a clear case in which a
disease produced a constitutional crisis, and led to the Act of Settlement of
1701, that prevented another Catholic from being crowned, and brought in the
House of Hanover. So, smallpox had a major impact in Western Europe. But its
impact is not a simple repetition of the story of plague. </p>
<p>Although it was
dreaded, smallpox did not give rise in Europe to mass hysteria, scapegoating
and a religious frenzy. And there are reasons for that we can surmise. Unlike
plague, smallpox was not a sudden outside invader that took society by
surprise. Nor did it maximize its fury by targeting young adults and the
middle-aged, who were the mainstays of families and of the economy. Smallpox
was an endemic disease that was ever-present, and so it was considered almost
normal, especially because it targeted infants and children, as a rule;
although, as I&#39;ve said, it did lead sporadically to broader epidemics. So, as
a result everyone had some experience with smallpox, and half the people you
might meet on the street, in a city of Western Europe, would be pockmarked, as
a reminder of its passage. </p>
<p>So familiar was
smallpox that it bred a kind of fatalism, the belief that it was inevitable in
people&#39;s lives. And this attitude was so pervasive that it wasn&#39;t uncommon
even for parents to expose healthy children intentionally to mild cases, in the
hope that they could protect them from something much more catastrophic. We
could look at this attitude by--or appreciate it--by thinking about European
literature, particularly British literature, let&#39;s say in the eighteenth
century. Let&#39;s think, for example, of Henry Fielding&#39;s novel <i>Tom Jones</i>.
In that, when it was useful to have a change in plot, all the author had to do
was to introduce the idea of smallpox, because no one would question that that
was appropriate, or consider that this was a clumsy or artificial artifice. </p>
<p>Everyone expected
smallpox. And in Fielding&#39;s novel, <i>Joseph Andrews</i>, we find that there&#39;s
a heroine who is pockmarked. Or consider Thackeray&#39;s <i>The Adventures of
Henry Esmond</i>, set in the eighteenth century, where smallpox drives the
plot. Smallpox, quite simply, was just there, and it came to seem, for many
people, a terrible but everyday part of the human condition. So, smallpox
didn&#39;t cause great European cities, like London, to empty of their population,
when people took the road in flight, as plague did in the seventeenth century
and, as we shall see, that cholera was to do again in the nineteenth century.
And there wasn&#39;t an urge to seek scapegoats for what seemed an almost natural
or normal event. But this is a generalization, and there are reports of some
who lost their nerve at the approach of smallpox and sought refuge in flight. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s return to our
novel, <i>Henry Esmond</i>. There&#39;s a heroine, Lady Castlewood, who contracts
smallpox as an adult, in a country village. Her husband--and this was
surprising because we&#39;re told early on that he was an extraordinarily brave
soldier, but he was a man who couldn&#39;t bear to face a disease that he couldn&#39;t
fight and threatened him, not only with death, but this seemed to matter
perhaps more to him than death itself--he thought he was extremely handsome and
he was afraid that he would be maimed if he survived. So, unwilling to put his
fair complexion, and his even fairer hair, at risk, Lord Castlewood took to his
heels, and he deserted his household for the duration. But he wasn&#39;t part of a
mass exodus. Although Thackery does have Henry Esmond, the hero of the story,
tell us himself that smallpox was, in his words, &quot;the most dreadful
scourge of the world.&quot; </p>
<p>We also know that as
a result of her ordeal, Lady Castlewood lost her beauty, and that her gallant
husband, on his return, no longer loved her as he once did. As readers then,
we know that one of the effects of smallpox was that it had a big impact on the
marriage market. It disfigured people and made them less likely to succeed in
those sweepstakes. We learn that Lady Castlewood, according to the author:
&quot;Her beauty was very much injured by the smallpox. When the marks of the
disease cleared away, the delicacy of her color and complexion was all gone.
Her eyes had lost their brilliancy. Her hair fell and her face looked old. It
was as if a coarse hand had rubbed off the delicate tints of that sweet
picture, and brought to it a dread color. Also it must be owned, her
ladyship&#39;s nose was greatly swollen and red.&quot; </p>
<p>In any case, as you
can imagine, having scars and pockmarks was also a source of great
psychological distress and unhappiness, and this too was part of the plot of
Thackeray&#39;s novel as it unfolds, and part of what we should remember as the
impact of smallpox on the terrible eighteenth century. But that was smallpox
in Europe: a major source of anxiety; a major impact on population; a source of
the Cult of Saint Nicaise; a major factor in demography. But there&#39;s a more
dramatic story that we need to come to, as we cross the waters and turn to the
New World, or also Australia and New Zealand. </p>
<p>This is the story of
what happened when the disease was suddenly introduced to populations in part
of the world where it was a new invader; where it arrived from outside, had
never been an endemic infection and therefore against which the native or
aboriginal population had no immunity at all. Then it produced real
catastrophes, events described as &quot;virgin soil epidemics.&quot; These were
catastrophes that accompanied European expansion to the New World, Australia,
New Zealand. And there smallpox, and another childhood disease that
accompanied it, measles, had a transformative importance in clearing the land
and promoting settlement by Europeans with their robust immunity. The impact
of smallpox and measles was greater than that of gunpowder. </p>
<p>In the New World,
you&#39;ll be reading about this in detail in that wonderful book by Elizabeth
Fenn, <i>Pox Americana</i>, and you might want to be reminded of the simple
fact that the author was actually a Yalie, and that the book that you&#39;re
reading began life here, as a Ph.D. dissertation. In any case, though, I want
to have a division of labor between the lectures and the reading, and so I
won&#39;t repeat the story that Fenn tells so movingly and so well. But there are
a few points that I would like to highlight as specific examples, and a couple
of general points. And first the general idea we should remember is that of
something sometimes referred to as &quot;the Columbian exchange.&quot; That is
to say that the European encounter with the New World brought about the
large-scale exchange from one side of the Atlantic to the other, and in the
reverse direction, of fauna and flora.</p>
<p>Certainly, as you
know, Europeans brought back the potato, maize and quinine, as examples, from
the Americas. And there&#39;s been a debate as to whether this also involved a
microbial component. And there are those who speculate that Columbus and his
sailors brought back the disease syphilis, as well from the New World. We&#39;ll
be returning to that argument later in the semester, when we come to talk about
syphilis as a disease. What&#39;s beyond doubt though is that there was also a
terrible movement of microbes in the other direction, as Europeans unintentionally
introduced smallpox and measles to the Americas. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s illustrate with
a specific example of the Columbian exchange--the exchange Fenn tells us
about--by looking at this much-travailed island of Hispaniola, the mountainous
Caribbean island where Columbus landed in the 1490s. Hispaniola--that is, what
is modern Haiti and the Dominican Republic. And as we know from today&#39;s news,
Haiti has a long history of natural and manmade catastrophes, and the arrival
of Columbus was certainly one. The aboriginal inhabitants, a tribe known as
the Arawaks, are estimated, or guesstimated, to have numbered something like a
million people in 1492. Columbus described Hispaniola as almost an earthly
paradise, a place of great natural beauty. And he reported that the Arawaks
were a welcoming and non-warlike people, who greeted the Spanish warmly and
showed them great kindness. But unfortunately for them, the kindness wasn&#39;t
reciprocal. </p>
<p>The Spaniards were
interested in profit, and international power politics. And Hispaniola was
strategically located. It also possessed fertile soil, a favorable climate,
and land that the Spanish Crown coveted for cultivation. So, European interest
was based on commerce, profit and international power considerations. The Spaniards
militarily dispossessed the Arawaks of their land, and intended to reduce them
to slavery, first in mines and then on the land. They were assisted in the
process, up to a point, by two great assets: gunpowder and disease. And as you
know from reading Fenn, the aboriginal population of the Americas lacked
immunity to European diseases like smallpox and measles. </p>
<p>There&#39;s no evidence
that there was a plot of genocide or bioterror in the intentional use of
disease as a means to clear the land and resettle it. What happened was
spontaneous, and not intentional. But the encounter between the Europeans and
the indigenous peoples of Hispaniola resulted in an extraordinary and
terrifying die-off. Between 1492 and 1520, the Native population was reduced from
a million people to 15,000. Disease thoroughly cleared Hispaniola for European
colonization, virtually without resistance. On the other hand, smallpox thwarted
the Spanish intention in Hispaniola to enslave the aboriginals. They simply
died off at too extraordinary a rate. It therefore led the Spaniards, out of
necessity, to turn to a different source of labor for mines and plantations.
And since Africans and Europeans shared disease reservoirs that were partially
overlapping, their people were resistant to many of the same epidemic diseases
that had destroyed the Native Americans. </p>
<p>So, disease was a
major factor in the establishment of the African slave trade and the
development of New World slavery. The Spaniards hardly delayed. 1517 marked
the beginning of the importation of African slaves to Hispaniola. Santo
Domingo, by 1789, received into its ports every year some 1,600 ships,
employing 24,000 sailors. And it accounted for 11 million pounds of the French
total of 17 million pounds of exports. Its trade was the foundation of the
wealth of port cities, like Nantes, Bordeaux and Marseilles, its cotton, a
basis for the French textile mills in Normandy, and the growth was
exponential. Between 1783 and 1789, production doubled, and with it the importation
of slaves: 10,000 a year in 1764; 15,000 in 1771; 27,000 in 1786; 40,000 in
1787. The leading port of Santo Domingo, the prosperous city of Le
Cap-Francois, had 20,000 people and was called &quot;the Paris of the
West.&quot; </p>
<p>The Columbian
exchange played a major role in the history of Hispaniola, and that was writ
large in the New World as a whole. A similar story could be told about Hernan
Cortez and his fellow conquistador, Francisco Pizarro, with regard to the Aztec
Empire of Mexico and the Incan Empire of Peru, which were destroyed not only by
gunpowder, but also by smallpox, that destroyed agriculture, led to famine,
destroyed the aboriginal military capacity to resist, and had, we&#39;re told, a
tremendous psychological impact, because their gods seemed not to protect
them. And, so, there was a wave of conversion to the European god, who seemed
to protect his own people. </p>
<p>Now, you also know,
from reading Elizabeth Fenn, that although this process was primarily
unintentional, there were moments within it, within the larger catastrophe, of
occasional acts of intentional genocide. And one was by Lord Jeffrey
Amherst--whom we&#39;re portraying here--who intentionally gave Native Americans
infected blankets. I thought I&#39;d perhaps tell you a little anecdote that I
won&#39;t vouch for historically. I know of it from oral history, from friends I
had at the time who attended Amherst College and told me about a demonstration
that I think took place in 1968. But that was that the plates--you&#39;ve just
seen Lord Jeffrey, who actually intentionally aimed at the die-off of
aboriginal populations, and intentionally gave Native Americans blankets
infected with smallpox scabs. </p>
<p>Well, the plates at
Amherst College in the 1960s looked like this, and they show Sir Jeffrey scourging
the Indian population with a whip, on horseback. And, so, in 1968, learning
about the experience of genocide, there was a demonstration when the students
of Amherst College stood up and smashed all the plates in the dining hall. In
any case, it was also the case that this sort of tremendous die off that
affected the Americas, cleared the land for European settlement, was repeated,
again not intentionally, but with regards in Australia to the Aboriginals, and
in New Zealand with regards the Maoris. But you have that story told vividly,
and on a large canvas, by Elizabeth Fenn&#39;s <i>Pox Americana</i>. So, I&#39;ll
leave you to read about that. </p>
<p>I&#39;d like to turn now
to our third point of the morning, which was the importance of smallpox for an
entirely different reason, and that is the development of a new and major
public health strategy; the strategy of inoculation initially, and that becomes
more definitively the strategy of vaccination. Well, let&#39;s begin with
inoculation. What is inoculation? It was an empirical practice--we might call
it a folk art--and it was developed in various parts of the world as a result
of two very simple observations. The first was that smallpox was clearly
contagious. The second was that those who had recovered from the disease--and
it was easy to know who had suffered from it because they were scarred and
pockmarked, or also they were often blind--and it was a simple observation that
they never caught smallpox a second time. </p>
<p>So, the idea
developed that it might be a wise measure to induce a mild case of smallpox
artificially, to protect a person, or especially a child, from the risk of
acquiring a naturally occurring but severe and life-threatening or maiming
case. And the practice that resulted was called variously inoculation,
variolation, or, in a gardening metaphor, engrafting. There were variations,
but the major technique was that liquid material from a smallpox pustule--you
saw those last time--of a patient selected for having a very mild case was
allowed to soak into a thread. The thread was then inserted into a superficial
cut, made with the lancet--this sharp instrument that you&#39;ve seen pictures of,
in an earlier lecture--into the arm of the person to be protected, and fastened
there for twenty-four hours. Twelve days later, the subject usually fell ill
with smallpox; hopefully suffered from a mild case for about a month;
convalesced for a further month; and then remained immune for a lifetime;
hopefully not pockmarked or blinded. </p>
<p>This practice of
inoculation was common in places like Turkey in the eighteenth century, but not
in Western Europe. A major role in bringing this practice to Britain and
Western Europe was played by this lady, the wife of the British Ambassador to
Turkey, Lady Mary Montague, who lived from 1689 to 1762. And she was
preoccupied with smallpox, in part because her own beauty had been compromised
by a severe attack of the disease, and she elected to protect her own children
by having them inoculated, by the practice I&#39;ve just described, while they were
in Constantinople. She returned to England in 1721 and launched a one-person,
a one-lady, mission to convince society to introduce the practice of
inoculation. She devoted herself to propagandizing British society in the
practice. She was able to convince the Princess of Wales, who had her
daughters inoculated, and the practice spread rapidly. </p>
<p>This was the first
major public health advance in dealing with smallpox. And, as I tried to
suggest last time, I would argue that it had a role--note that I&#39;m saying only <i>a</i>
role, not <i>the </i>role--as part of the background for the coming of the
Enlightenment. Indeed, leading <i>philosophes</i> became ardent advocates of
inoculation; people in France, like Voltaire and Charles de la Condamine; or on
this side of the water, people we might also describe as philosophes, like
Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Inoculation, appropriately, gained
most favor in England; the epicenter, perhaps, of smallpox in Europe. But it
gradually spread also to France, Holland, Germany, Sweden. In Russia, the
procedure was introduced by Catherine the Great, who imported an English
physician to inoculate her in 1768, after which the nobility rapidly adopted
the practice. </p>
<p>The cresting wave
then, of the smallpox epidemic, in the eighteenth century in Europe was met by
the first practical measure of public health against it. Well, why did
inoculation work, at least to the extent that it did? And I would say that
inoculation was a partial success. Biological processes were at work that are
still poorly understood. But there are a couple of relevant factors that we
could note. One was that as a matter of practice, this procedure took
infective material only from very mild cases. That was--the selection then of
cases was one reason behind its success. The infective matter also was made to
enter the body through the skin, in a way that doesn&#39;t happen in nature, and,
for reasons that aren&#39;t understood, attenuates the virulence of the virus. So,
the portal of entry into the body also seems to have made a difference. And
lastly, for all that one knows, those who were inoculated were also selected,
and you were only chosen for inoculation if you were healthy and robust. </p>
<p>There were, however,
problems. Inoculation was also a partially flawed procedure. All too often,
despite all precautions, it failed to produce the desired mild infection, but
led instead to severe illness and death; and invariably it caused a month or
two of immense suffering. It was also costly, since physicians insisted on a
lengthy period of preparation when they were performing the procedure. Wanting
to ensure that those they inoculated were in excellent health, they selected
patients carefully, and then isolated them for a month before the procedure,
during which they regulated their diet, their fresh air, their exercise; and
this was obviously an expensive process. So, inoculation was simply not
accessible to the poor. </p>
<p>Another factor was
that inoculation could run the risk, because it introduced actual smallpox
cases, and therefore it ran the risk of setting off an epidemic,
unintentionally, that those who contracted the disease would then spread it to
others around them. And to prevent that, smallpox inoculation hospitals--such
as one in London, that opened in 1746--were set up to care for the patients
who&#39;d been inoculated, and to quarantine them, so that they were no longer a
risk to others. But nevertheless, there was a spirited debate over the whole
issue of whether, on balance, inoculation saved many more lives than it
killed. </p>
<p>Well, that brings us
to this figure, a decisive figure in the history of medicine and public health,
and that is Edward Jenner. It was in the context of this smallpox catastrophe
of the eighteenth century, and of disappointments and anxieties surrounding
inoculation, that we see a decisive discovery in the history of medicine and public
health, associated with this English country doctor. To understand what
happened, we need to remember what we said last time; and that is that there
were three species of the genus of orthopoxviruses: <i>Variola major, Variola
minor, and cowpox</i>. The first two are exclusively infectious to human
beings, but the third mainly affects cattle. But the point is that, under the
right conditions, cowpox can be transmitted to humans, among whom it induces a
mild illness, but it provides--and this was the crucial point--a robust
crossover immunity to <i>Variola major</i>. </p>
<p>Now, in Britain, the
people thought most likely to contract cowpox were milkmaids. And Jenner--and
this is why I stressed that he was a country doctor; this is his home in
Barkley in Gloucester, in the west of England--he made an observation that
could only have been made by a doctor with a rural practice, in a dairy county,
at a time of severe prevalence of smallpox. And this observation was that
milkmaids never seemed to come down with smallpox. Jenner, like others--he
wasn&#39;t the first to make this observation, but he took it to heart and
attempted the next step of an experimentation. </p>
<p>A crucial experiment
occurred in 1796. The milkmaid Sarah Nelms contracted cowpox, and this is
the--we&#39;ll see the experiment. Edward Jenner took the infective material from
Sarah Nelms and vaccinated the eight-year-old son of his gardener, on his
property, in 1796, and then, after a period of time, had a challenge in
vaccination with live smallpox virus. And happily the experiment was a great
success, and Edward Phipps demonstrated that he was immune, by this procedure,
to smallpox. And, so, soon thereafter, Edward Jenner--whatever one thinks, by
modern terms, of the medical ethics of that particular experiment--in 1798
Edward Jenner wrote one of the most influential works in the history of medicine,
inquiring into the causes and effects of the <i>Variola vaccinae</i>. </p>
<p>His genius was not
just to devise the experiment; that was scientifically flawed, perhaps, in the
sense that he extrapolated from a very small database. But in any case, the
point is that he recognized the significance of what he&#39;d discovered. He
thought that he saw immediately the possibility of eradicating smallpox from
the planet, an idea whose importance the British Parliament recognized soon
afterwards when it declared vaccination, &quot;the greatest
discovery&quot;--I&#39;m quoting--&quot;in the history of medicine.&quot; Jenner
wrote, in 1801, that he longed for, &quot;the annihilation of the smallpox, the
most dreadful scourge of the human race. That must be the final result of this
practice.&quot; </p>
<p>So, Jenner had the
genius to see the full implication of his discovery, and then he devoted the
remainder of his life single-mindedly to the cause of promoting this
revolutionary method, not only in Britain but also globally. It was also the
first example of a new and highly effective style of public health, by
vaccination, a method that&#39;s proved its effectiveness; certainly with regard to
smallpox, but you could also mention polio, tetanus, rabies, influenza,
diphtheria, shingles, and a host of other diseases. And Jenner soon made
influential converts, who established vaccination as a major instrument of
public health: Napoleon in France, Pope Pius VII in Rome, Benjamin Waterhouse
and Thomas Jefferson on these shores. </p>
<p>Jenner&#39;s method, then,
was a means to combat smallpox. And unlike inoculation, vaccination didn&#39;t
introduce an infection of smallpox itself, and therefore had no risk of setting
off an unintended epidemic. It also had a low risk of serious complications
for the individual patient, and no risk at all for the community. But there
were problems with Jenner&#39;s method, and it was to require a series of
subsequent improvements to make vaccination a fully successful procedure. The
problems involved such things as he required, at the time, an arm-to-arm
method, and this entailed the risk of spreading other diseases, in particular
syphilis, while trying to present smallpox. </p>
<p>There were also
failed vaccinations that led to complications, and Jenner made a crucial
mistake. He made it an article of dogmatic faith that the immunity derived
from smallpox vaccination artificially was life-long, just like the natural
immunity that was acquired, and he steadfastly refused to consider evidence
that ran counter to his dogma. In fact, artificial immunity wears off, it&#39;s
now known, after a period that&#39;s not quite understood, but ten, fifteen, twenty
years, and requires, to still be valid, re-vaccination. This blindness on
Jenner&#39;s part discredited vaccination in some quarters, and was one
factor--these various limitations then--for one of the most powerful mass
movements of the nineteenth century, and one that&#39;s still with us today, and
that is the antivaccination movement. </p>
<p>Vaccination became
one of the contested debates of nineteenth-century medicine. In Britain, an
Antivaccination League was founded, and became a major political influence.
There were various sources of opposition. There was the empirical observation
of failure, as I&#39;ve said, when people who had been vaccinated actually
contracted smallpox. There was the opposition of liberals and libertarians to
what they regarded as the excessive power of the state in making vaccination
compulsory. And there was religious opposition, people who considered it an
act of impiety to introduce material from animals into a human body, and there
were sardonic posters featuring people undergoing vaccination while they
sprouted horns or turned into cows. </p>
<p>But despite vaccination, there was, in
Britain, an Act of 1840 that provided for free infant vaccination. And from
that time, the annual toll from smallpox began to plummet, despite the fact
that the nineteenth century provided conditions that would have been favorable
to promoting the disease: improved and speedy transport, with steamships,
canals and the railroads; crowding with a population that was ever more mobile,
massive growth and urbanization and large cities. And those changes and
advances were reproduced across Europe and North America.</p>
<p>And there were
technological improvements as well--all of which leads me to the end of this
morning--which is to say in 1959, the World Health Organization undertook the
unprecedented step of launching a global smallpox eradication program by means
of vaccination. In 1977, the final natural case occurred. And in 1980,
smallpox was declared, by the WHO, eradicated everywhere on the globe. So,
vaccination then comes with this extraordinary history of public health, of
combating a major disease like smallpox and actually eradicating it. </p>
<p>What we&#39;ll want to
do, as we move through the course, is to ask what are the conditions that make
vaccination an appropriate tool for public health? When is it not
appropriate? Why are there such difficulties with poliomyelitis, as we&#39;re
speaking today? Was smallpox the beginning of a wave of diseases to be
eradicated this way, one by one? Or was smallpox an exception, a special
case? Well, stay tuned, and we&#39;ll deal with that. </p>
