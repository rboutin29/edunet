<h2>RLST 152:<strong> Introduction to New Testament History and Literature</strong> (Spring, 2009)</h2>

<h3>Syllabus</h3>
<h4>Professor:</h4>

<p class="lastParagraph">Dale B. Martin, Woolsey Professor of Religious Studies, Yale University</p>

<h4>Description:</h4>

<p class="lastParagraph">This course provides a historical study of the origins of Christianity by analyzing the literature of the earliest Christian movements in historical context, concentrating on the New Testament. Although theological themes will occupy much of our attention, the course does not attempt a theological appropriation of the New Testament as scripture. Rather, the importance of the New Testament and other early Christian documents as ancient literature and as sources for historical study will be emphasized. A central organizing theme of the course will focus on the differences within early Christianity (-ies).</p>

<h4>Texts:</h4>

<p>A modern translation of the Bible. <em>The New Revised Standard Version</em> is recommended. A good study-Bible edition is <em>The New Oxford Annotated Bible with Apocrypha</em>. Other reputable modern editions, such as <em>The New English Bible</em>, <em>The Jerusalem Bible</em>, or <em>The New International Version</em>, are acceptable. This is meant to exclude old versions, such as the <em>King James Version</em> or the <em>Douay Version</em>, and modern paraphrases, such as <em>The Living Bible</em>.<br />
