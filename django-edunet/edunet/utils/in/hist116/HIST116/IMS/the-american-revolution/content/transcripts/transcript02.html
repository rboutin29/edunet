<p><strong>Professor Joanne Freeman:&nbsp; </strong>Today we're going to be talking about being a British
colonist, which means we're going to be discussing how you would feel if you
were part of the British Empire in the mid-eighteenth century, living in the
North American colonies shortly before the onset of the Revolution. And for
those of you who were not here on Tuesday, I talked for a little while--I'll
just mention it here--about how this course was really going to be exploring
the mindset of the people who were experiencing the Revolution to really try to
get at the logic behind both what the British colonists and the British
authorities were doing, and how that ultimately resulted in a war.&nbsp; So we're
really -- we're going to try to really kind of create two opposing forms of
logic and understand how they came to oppose each other and how that ended up
leading in to conflict.</p>
<p>So it makes sense
that as a starting point we're going to start by essentially talking about some
of the basics about being a British colonist in North America: what their world
would have been like, what your world would have been like if you had been a
colonist, what your feelings would have been about yourself as part of the
British Empire if you were a colonist in the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Now I'll note here
just in passing that the first part of Gordon Wood's <em>Radicalism--</em>which I
already mentioned once--that actually deals a lot with a topic that I'll be
talking about today and I think in one or two more lectures, the sort of idea
about what the colonies were like prior to the Revolution. That book overall
presents an argument about how the colonies went from monarchy--The first third
of the book is monarchy and then the second third of the book is republicanism
and then the third is democracy, and I think I said--Tuesday I said,
"Think about what words mean," and I'm sure that will come into play
in Gordon Wood, but the monarchy section not surprisingly goes into some depth
about some of the things I'm going to be talking about today and on Tuesday,
which is, kind of: &nbsp;life in the colonies before the war, sort of just basically
what did it mean, how did it work, how did society function.</p>
<p>Okay. So let's
actually start with some of the basics. The first and most basic:&nbsp; If you were
a British colonist here in North America, you would be living somewhere along
the Atlantic seaboard. The colonial population was largely clustered right
along the shoreline for really practical reasons. I'm sure you don't have to be
very imaginative to think why. Obviously, for reasons of trade, for reasons of
shipping and even just for reasons of communication it made sense, not to
mention the fact that people had a pretty healthy fear of potentially
unfriendly Indians who were not particularly pleased with the idea of losing
land to potentially advancing settlers.</p>
<p>Now if you were male,
you might very well be a small landholder because about sixty percent of the
white male colonists owned land and, as I'll talk about down the road a little
bit, that's--actually when you compare that with the rates of land ownership in
Europe, that's actually pretty high, it's a pretty high rate of ownership, and
even in today's lecture you'll see how that actually has an impact on how
things are functioning in the American colonies. You probably would be a small
landholder. You might be if you were living in one of the small cities along
the coast maybe a merchant or an artisan. As a non-enslaved person, you would
probably have decent clothes. You'd probably have a decent home. You probably
would have some degree of economic and personal independence, and right around
the turn--let's say 1770--you would be one of about two million North American
colonists, which is actually if you think about it--Certainly, if you--if I
asked you to guess how many colonists there were in 1770, you probably would
not say two million. It's a lot.&nbsp; And that includes both free people and
slaves, and you would have been living in a society that was so booming with
prosperity that between the years 1700 and 1770--so we're just talking about a seventy-year
period--the population increased from 200,000 to over two million in just a seventy-year
period, which is amazing. So basically, things were increasing. Every decade
the population was increasing at a rate of roughly thirty to forty percent.
That's a huge rate of growth.</p>
<p>You would be living
in the midst of a host of British colonies, so it's not just you along the
seaboard but obviously to the north there is Canada, to the south there were
British islands in the West Indies which were known as the Sugar Islands, and
to the west was the vast 'scary wilderness' populated by potentially unfriendly
Indians with what felt to you as though it was an entirely foreign culture, and
then of course to the east--there is civilization to your east. There is the
metropolis, there is England, there is culture in the minds of the colonists
and probably to many people in England as well, the height of cultural and
political sophistication.&nbsp; When you looked to the east, and it really was--if
you were a colonist it was looking to the east towards England that you really
got a sense of yourself as a British colonist and really felt that you belonged
to something that was powerful and admirable and world-shaping and victorious.
Basically, you understood yourself as being part of an empire by identifying
with that center of empire to the east.</p>
<p>As an example of
this, just listen to someone who ends up being a rather prominent American
revolutionary, and I mentioned him as a matter of fact on Tuesday. I called him
the doctor to the stars and that's kind of unfair to him, but Benjamin Rush. He
actually was a really prominent man of science at the time. He moved in very
high political circles. When I was thinking about this lecture today I
remembered, or at least I hope I remembered--I think I'm not leading you astray--I
think that actually Rush helped Thomas Paine edit <em>Common Sense, </em>and I
think he edited out a sentence that I wished Paine had left in, so I don't like
Rush as an editor very much. I think I'll--we'll wait until we get to <em>Common
Sense </em>but--and supposedly, allegedly, it's Rush who came up with the title <em>Common
Sense, </em>that Paine was going to call it <em>Plain Truth, </em>and Rush--I
think Rush wins on that. I think <em>Plain Truth </em>is not as snazzy as <em>Common
Sense </em>but either way--So Rush -- The--My main point here in blathering
happily about Rush is he's not some little modest humbug of a guy. Right? He's
someone of status.</p>
<p>So this is Rush's
response when he saw the throne of the King of England.&nbsp; So Rush said, "I
felt as though I were on sacred ground. I gazed for some time at the throne
with emotions that I cannot describe."&nbsp; Okay. He's just dumbstruck at the
throne of the King of England, just looking at it. Now we sit here and we think
back. We're: "Oh, boy, aren't those monarchists really cute,"&nbsp; [laughs]
"those cute monarchists, those silly people who are amazed at a throne,"
which is pretty much I think what I thought was--wow, what an interesting phase
in American history when they were dazzled by a throne.</p>
<p>Then, a couple of
years ago I ended up being lucky enough to have a Member of Parliament show me
around the Houses of Parliament.&nbsp; And I was excited; it was pretty neat and I'm
being all American historian-ish, you know: "Oh, how similar, how
interesting when you compare." So I'm doing the geeky historian thing and
then this member of Parliament who's showing me around takes me in to what he
describes to me as the robing chamber for the Queen where she puts on her crown
and ceremonial robes before she goes in to the House of Lords, which I gather
she does at the beginning of every session of Parliament. Okay. So I walk in to
[laughs] the robing chamber and at the head of that room there's a throne, sort
of an elevated throne, so instantly, without even thinking, in my head, I'm
thinking: wow, [laughs] that's the throne, [laughs] and then I thought, I just
became Benjamin Rush. Just like that, I went right into the monarchy vortex. It
didn't really take me very long, so I can't chortle at Rush anymore. So there
is something impressive, and particularly at this moment if you had been a
colonist--and not that many people I should say necessarily even got to travel
to Europe; I'll talk a little bit about that later on too--but you certainly
would have been awestruck and impressed by something like the throne of the
King of England.</p>
<p>Okay. So, as
suggested by Rush quavering in front of the throne, as a colonist you would be
proud to be British. You would have a really deep affection for the mother
country and it would be an affection that was really rooted in bonds of culture
and tradition and language. Basically, you would really consider yourself lucky
to belong to a powerful nation that granted its citizens, you believed, more
liberty than any nation on earth.</p>
<p>Unlike other modern
empires at the time, England seemed, particularly to the English, to be an
empire that was bound together not by force but by bonds of interconnectedness
and affection as well as a joint appreciation, a real love, of liberty and
order. And we're going to come back to this idea of liberty a little bit later
in the course where we start to really talk about the logic of revolution, but
for now I'll just highlight the fact that if you asked an English-speaking
person of the eighteenth century about liberty he or she would have told you
that liberty was worth more than life. Right? Liberty was it. Liberty was what
mattered. It was the most important possession of a civilized people, and of
course the British people, colonists and all, felt that they were at the peak
of the civilized world. As somebody at the time wrote, "What signify
riches?&nbsp; What signifies health, or life itself without liberty?&nbsp; Life without
liberty is the most errant trifle, the most insignificant enjoyment in the
world." Okay, extreme, but something to think about. I suppose it's
related to what I said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>I think it's also
easy to hear some of this talk that sounds really inflated and to dismiss it as
mere rhetoric, and I'm sure there is some mere rhetoric floating around here,
but it's important I think not to dismiss things that sound extreme and
emotional as simply emotional and extreme. Some of this actually represents
sincere thought so I think before you think these guys are sort of overexcited
about things, think to yourself that they actually honestly may be overexcited;
it might just be that they're dramatic, but that they sincerely feel these
things.</p>
<p>There was a time when
historians did assume that a lot of revolutionary rhetoric from the colonists
was actually kind of inflated, kind of for propaganda purposes, and it took a
while--Actually, the <em>Faces of Revolution </em>book by Bailyn, part of the
book that I mentioned before that comes from his larger book on the ideology of
the Revolution, he's the guy who said, "I've read several hundred
Revolutionary War pamphlets and I actually think they're serious. I think we
have to take them seriously. I don't think it's propaganda or rhetoric. I think
they actually feel these things."&nbsp; So again, to us it might sound a little
inflated but their feelings are really strong, and again liberty is one of the
things that we'll find they're feeling very strongly about.</p>
<p>So as a colonist, you
would be proud to be British, you would be really obviously proud of British
liberties, and you would have been particularly proud about being British after
the French and Indian War in the 1760s, when North American colonists fought
right alongside the British army and helped them defeat England's great enemy,
the French--and more on that to come for sure, but that was a really proud
moment for the colonists, that they felt that they were right there with the
British army fighting against the French.</p>
<p>Above all else, as
British colonists you would of course consider yourselves to be British
subjects through and through, equal to all other British subjects, even those
living off in the east in the metropolis. You were a British subject and you
deserved the rights of a British subject, but as a colonist living on the
peripheries of the British Empire, on the edge of what was perceived at the
time to be a howling wilderness, which is one of those great eighteenth-century
ways of referring to North America, you also would be a little nervous about
your status as a British subject, worried about how you rated in comparison
with people living in the mother country at the center of the empire.</p>
<p>Everything seemed
more sophisticated in England, and I suppose everything was more sophisticated [laughs]
in England, but it definitely seemed that way to the colonists. The clothes
were more fashionable; the homes were grander and more stately; the
intellectual life was rich and challenging. In comparison with the
sophisticated people in England, you as a North American colonist pretty much
felt like a country bumpkin; you felt kind of dull, kind of primitive, somewhat
rude, and certainly you felt potentially irrelevant. You really did feel that
you were on the edge of a howling wilderness.</p>
<p>So in essence, like
most British colonists in North America, if you were there at the time, you
would have had an ongoing inferiority complex. Now there were a number of ways
in which you might deal with your insecurities. One way to deal with that would
have been to become really apologetic for what would have been labeled as
American speech patterns or American manners, and I've already given you one
arrogant British quote by that fellow on Tuesday who said that he was mortified
that these crude colonists spoke English and could trace themselves to us
because they speak our language. So that's sort of the ultimate nasty stab at
the colonists.</p>
<p>So you actually for
good reason might feel kind of embarrassed about your manners and your speech.
You probably would feel equally embarrassed at the meanness of your
architecture, your buildings--they're smaller and less impressive--at the
pallor of your intellectual life, at the relative unimportance of your public
affairs. Like a lot of colonial writers who wrote pamphlets or books addressed
to an English audience, you probably would apologize for the poor quality of
your work by reminding readers, as one writer did, "I live in the
uncultivated woods of America, far from the fountains of science and with but
very rare opportunities of conversing with learned men."&nbsp; That almost
sounds like someone who feels sorry for himself. 'I am so far from civilization.'</p>
<p>Or, you might boast
about colonial society, not claiming to be better than the mother country but
instead bragging that the colonies represented Britain in miniature; that
colonial legislatures in this sense were kind of like mini-Parliaments. Or, you
might admit that the colonies were different from England but boast that in the
same way that England once had been pure and virtuous, you in the colonies were
maintaining the sort of pure, virtuous England, and that England itself was
becoming corrupt and its cities were becoming cesspools, but there in the
colonies you were preserving the true British heritage.</p>
<p>Still, whichever you
chose to rationalize or understand your status as a colonist, you could not
escape the fact that you were a colonist and that you were far away from the
center of the civilized world. As the young John Dickinson of Pennsylvania put
it, and we're going to meet John Dickinson again for sure later on in the
course, he wrote to his father while he was studying law in London and he said
that when colonists went to England and saw "the difference between themselves
and the polite part of the world they must be miserable." He actually thinks if
people--any colonist goes to London and sees what the polite part of the world
lives like, they'll never be able to hold their head up in the colonies ever
again.</p>
<p>And Jefferson felt
the same way. Thomas Jefferson actually--as much as he adored being
particularly in France, he actually said more than once that he thought that
young American men should not be allowed to go to Europe because if
impressionable young men went to Europe they would be so impressed by Paris and
London that they would never be able to hold their heads up in Massachusetts or
Virginia. It would look so puny and insignificant in comparison that they would
never be good Americans ever again and that they'd have to go back to Europe.</p>
<p>Now of course the
British agreed generally with this assessment of colonial society. Colonists
obviously were inferior and rough and rustic and crude, so as promised, here is
yet another arrogant British quote in my series of arrogant British quotes. In
this case one British observer noted, "American colonists may try to ape
British habits and customs but they're no more than ruffled dunces." &nbsp;I
just think there's--these guys have a real vim and vigor for finding the little
zippy, stingy, nasty statement. I think "ruffled dunces" is a pretty
good one.&nbsp; "What else could be expected from aggrandized upstarts in those
infant countries of America who never have an opportunity to see, or if they
had, the opportunity [correction: capacity] to observe the different ranks of
men in polite nations?" Notice how the colonies are never polite. [laughs]
There are the polite nations, and then there's these scary, howling wilderness
colonists.</p>
<p>Along these same
lines, there's actually another professor here at Yale, Kariann Yokota, and
some of her work shows--I found this really fascinating--that the British
regularly sent damaged or second-rate goods to the colonists because they
figured the colonists wouldn't know the difference. They just kept the
first-rate stuff for themselves, like:&nbsp; Broken? Massachusetts. [laughs] They'll
never know. Last week's, last year's style?&nbsp; Massachusetts. So basically all of
this shows that if Americans had an inferiority complex, they had some reason
to have one.</p>
<p>Now let me add at
this point that this anxiety about how the colonists rated in comparison with
England, specifically in Europe, the polite world, generally doesn't end with
the Revolution. It's not as though suddenly we win the Revolution and we don't
really care what the rest of the world thinks. Even after the colonies and then
the states had fought and defeated the great power of the British empire and
successfully created a new national constitution, Americans were still worried
about looking sophisticated enough in the eyes of the world.</p>
<p>And my favorite
example of this--It's a little bit down the road from the moment that we're at
in this course but I just can't resist adding it in because it's just--it makes
me happy and it's John Adams--and it's actually from 1789. It's right when this
new national Constitution has gone into effect and the Senate is debating what
the title should be for the new national executive. Right? We know there's
going to be a national executive. We don't know what we're going to call him. And
so the Senate is debating this, and someone in the Senate says, "Well, why
don't we call him President of the United States?"&nbsp; Okay. This horrifies John
Adams, absolutely horrifies him, and as he says at the time--He says, "For
God's sake, there are presidents of cricket clubs." [laughs] President of the
United States: and I'll quote him exactly here. He does say there are
presidents of cricket clubs but he says in the Senate--Where is it here?--"What
will the common people of foreign countries, what will the sailors and soldiers
say?&nbsp; George Washington, President of the United States?&nbsp; They will despise him
to all eternity."&nbsp; [laughter]&nbsp; Right? So Adams is thinking in a world
where you have His Royal Highness, protector of the realm: President of the
United States--he's just thinking that there's no comparison; it doesn't rank.</p>
<p>So as we're going to
be seeing in future weeks of this course, there's a constant thinking about
what--how we are being looked upon and that doesn't go away. It shifts, it's
different, but it remains for quite some time. America in one way or another
always assumes they're being watched and judged. In the 1760s, we'll see soon
how these sort of colonial feelings of inferiority would help fuel the
hypersensitivity of the colonists to infringements on their rights by the
mother country.</p>
<p>Now despite all of
this anxiety, all of this inferiority complex that I'm talking about here, as a
colonist you did share a base of assumptions and values with your counterparts
in England. So, first of all, as an individual you assumed that you lived in a
great hierarchy, a sort of natural order, everyone in his or her place,
deferent to those that were beneath you, respected but--I'm sorry--deferent to
those above you--That's a nifty order, to be deferent to those beneath you and
respected. You would be respectful to those above, and people below you would
be deferential to you, so basically everyone is in their place and everybody is
acting respectful and deferential as they properly should, and this--you'll see
a lot of this in Gordon Wood.</p>
<p>Now of course the
American version of this great social order, this great hierarchy, is different
in some ways from its British equivalent because the colonies lacked both the
top-most and the bottom-most rungs of society in England. So in the colonies
there wasn't a titled entrenched aristocracy and there wasn't an entrenched
peasant class. Instead the colonies had what some called a middling society
which was populated mostly by either middling folk, logically enough, who had
migrated from England to better their lot in life, by the English poor who
hoped to better themselves, and by some of the lower ranks of the English
gentry like third or fourth sons of the English gentry, who basically knew they
weren't going to inherit anything in England and so their thought was: well,
maybe if I head out to the colonies I-- it'll be easier for me to get some land
there; I'll be able to better myself; I'll be able to basically make something
of myself there easier than I can here.</p>
<p>Now if you were
thinking about going to the colonies and you really wanted to get rich quick,
the West Indies was the place to go, though it also offered some of the
absolute worst living conditions in the British colonial world. Life there was
extremely hard. There was unbearable heat. All energies were focused on gaining
money and little else. West Indian planters were so focused on money, money
crops, they actually didn't even bother to grow their own food. They imported
food because they didn't want to waste land, energy, and resources on growing
their own food. They were really focused on their money crop. If you went to
the Indies to get rich quick, typically you either made it big or failed
miserably, and either way typically what happened is you would go to the
Indies, you would establish a plantation, you would find an overseer, you would
put him in charge, and then you would flee back to England and be an absentee
landlord and let the people live in misery in the West Indies while you
collected the profit off of your sugar crop back home in England. Now the
Indies, not surprisingly, might seem a little intimidating. If you wanted to
get rich quick, you might choose not to go down to the scary sugar islands.</p>
<p>You might decide
instead to go to the southern colonies to get rich quick, and for example it
was largely sons of the lesser gentry in England who went to Jamestown at the
start of the seventeenth century in Virginia. And, logically enough, since
these are sons of the lesser gentry and they consider themselves to be above
hard labor, they show up to this rather primitive new colony in Jamestown, they
refuse to work to grow their own food, and they starve to death.&nbsp; [laughs]
That's a serious commitment to your status. 'I'm sorry. I'm above plowing. I'm
going to die now.'&nbsp; [laughter]&nbsp; You think sooner or later they kind of figure: &nbsp;a
little plowing--life. It's kind of--I don't know.</p>
<p>At any rate, there's
a reason why Jamestown didn't do so well and there's--a great example of this
weird mentality is Nathaniel Bacon, who is a gentile colonist. He's a younger
son of a member of the British gentry and in the seventeenth century sure
enough he migrates, he ends up in Virginia, and he arrives in Virginia like a
lot of people assuming that he deserved power, he deserved land, and he
deserved status. He's among the lesser gentry but he still is among the upper
crust in England and now he's arriving among the rude, ruffled dunces [laughs]
of the colonies. He assumes he's someone who deserves what he wants. Lo and
behold, he gets there and he finds that actually in Virginia there's a kind of an
inner core of men, self-made men, who had been there for awhile, or their
families had been there for awhile, and basically they controlled most of the
land, they controlled most of the government offices, they had most of the
power, and thus they could exclude Bacon and others from getting what they
wanted.</p>
<p>Bacon obviously is a
person who's much more interested in making money than in the good of the
colony so he responded to his frustration at not being able to get land or
power by surrounding himself with a pack of equally-frustrated angry young men
who also wanted land and also wanted power, and eventually they came up with
the brilliant idea that they would stage an enormous attack on Indians,
massacre them all and steal their land. Brilliant plot.</p>
<p>So Bacon and his pack
of guys sort of go off and actually start this in action. The governor of the
colony sees that this is rapidly spinning out of control and becoming wild,
crazy Indian warfare so he tries to stifle it and Nathaniel Bacon and his
friends did what I suppose appeared logical to them at the time. They burned
Jamestown to the ground because they were angry.&nbsp; [laughs]&nbsp; Well, that's
serious anger. 'Oh, you're going to stop us?&nbsp; We'll just destroy the capital.'
[laughter]&nbsp; 'You're gone.'&nbsp; Now the story is kind of anticlimactic because
Bacon ultimately dies miserably of dysentery while running away from
authorities so there's not a lot of glory [laughs] in Bacon's ultimate end, but
he's definitely a really good example of greedy self-interest and of the sense
of deservedness because of his social rank and this disgust at the power of
these self-made men in Virginia. There were some gentry who would have migrated
to the colonies who would have had some kind of a similar feeling about what
they saw and what they expected.</p>
<p>But the gentry was
only a minority of the people who migrated to the colonies. Most were lower in
status, some were of the lowest rank of all, landless people and sometimes
criminals. So if you committed a crime in England, you might be offered the
option between prison in England and being sent to the colonies, and to some
this was actually a really hard choice. Right? 'Prison, the colonies, prison,
the colonies. I don't know.'&nbsp; The howling wilderness was very scary. Now some
people opted for the howling wilderness, obviously, and some people, poorer
people, decided to take their chances on the colonies, sold themselves into
servitude as indentured servants for five to seven years at a time, and in
exchange their passage was paid, they owed a certain amount of work, and at the
end of their time of indenture they would get some plot of land. So there were
a good number of indentured servants, and as a matter of fact some of those
Virginia power mongers who were blocking Bacon out had started out actually as
indentured servants. That's--When you talk self-made you're really talking
self-made, people who came, did their indenture, got some land and then really
built their way up. So self-improvement obviously is one reason to head to the
colonies.</p>
<p>Another reason,
another thing that might drive you to head off to the colonies, would have been
if you belonged to a religious minority that was seemingly increasing unpopular
in England. So if you were a Puritan, if you were a Quaker, if you were
Catholic, again probably middling in status, you might decide to try your luck
in the colonies where either you thought there might be more religious
tolerance, or just as likely there'd be land so empty of people that it
wouldn't really be a worry of yours. There wouldn't be people around there to
be intolerant of you and so it probably would be better than what you were
experiencing in England. Obviously, a lot of New England was settled by
Puritans with that mindset. Pennsylvania had the Quaker faith at its cure--at
its core. It was founded by William Penn, who was actually a member of the
aristocracy. He became a Quaker and then he used his high connections to get a
royal charter from the King to found a colony for Quakers. And Maryland began
as a place that was distinctly friendly to people of the Catholic faith.</p>
<p>Now out of all of
these kinds of colonists that I'm talking about here, what was missing was a
titled, sort of to-the-manor-born, established aristocracy of dukes and
duchesses unshakably of the highest rank in society. This doesn't mean that
colonial society didn't have an established elite, because certainly every
colony had certain great families that controlled large amounts of power and
land. And as a colonist, and an average colonist, you would have had no problem
differentiating these gentlefolk from the common masses--right?--these sort of
gentlemen and gentlewomen. They dressed differently; they held themselves
differently; they spoke differently; you addressed these people by Mister or
Madame or Esquire. You actually visibly could tell who the sort of upper-crust
people in society were. Some families held obvious power but again not in the
unquestionable way that the aristocracy remained in control in England. A lot
of these people that I just mentioned had worked their way into positions of
prominence, so ultimately the line dividing sort of upper-crusty people from
less upper-crusty people was less sort of absolute. It was less distinct than
it would have been in a country or in a place where there was a really
established aristocracy.</p>
<p>So basically even
though you could tell who the elite are and you could tell who the masses are,
there is slippage up and down between the two. It's not as though there is a
dividing line and you could never hope to become an aristocrat. It's a little
blurrier; it's again a middling society; it's part of what that means. And
because of that, things like formal titles and fine clothing were of extreme
importance in the colonies--and in a lot of ways more important in the colonies
than they were in England--because they really were ways of proving your status
in a place where you felt the need to prove your status.</p>
<p>If you think about
it, your status would have been just a matter of common agreement. You were
only as lofty in status as people believed you were and if someone felt
compelled to call you by a title or if you were wearing fine clothing that
people knew they themselves couldn't afford, that could go a long way towards
convincing people of your status and importance. So for example, if you had any
military service at all, even for the briefest moment you'd served in the
military, and you were an officer, you would insist forever after to the end of
your days that you be called always by your title like Colonel So-and-So or
Captain So-and-So. That military title counted for a lot. That was really a
sort of unquestioned symbol of rank and authority, and in fact some people
joined the military just because they knew by doing so they would get a title
and then they would be able to hang on to that title to really claim a place
for themselves in society.</p>
<p>And when I was
researching my first book I came across a case where there were these two guys--it
sounds like a bad joke--two guys in a tavern. There were these two guys in a
tavern and one of them is a military officer and one of them isn't, and I guess
the guy who wasn't a military officer wasn't so clear on the whole rank thing
and he called the fellow by a lower rank than he was: well, Captain Something
instead of Colonel Something--and the guy was so insulted that his title had
been lowered by who-the- hell-was-this-person that he actually challenged him
to a duel right there. 'I'm sorry, but I'm willing to kill you now.'&nbsp; [laughs]
'You called me Captain. You die.'&nbsp; [laughter] It was a serious insult, a dread
insult--and also he might have just been a crazy person but--[laughs] That's
possible too, but still it actually was a serious insult.</p>
<p>And because military
titles and status went hand in hand, sometimes strangers who seemed to be high-ranking
were just called Colonel or General because they seemed important and thus they
must have a military rank. And I actually found a diary of someone, this sort
of member of the South Carolina elite, and he was wandering around in the
backcountry. And he says in his diary, no matter where he went, he was called
Colonel, which amazed him because he said not only had he never had any
military service but --and I don't know what this means; I don't know enough
about him to know--but he kept saying over and over again, 'I really don't look
like a military person, nothing about me,' so I'm imagining this sort of
sloppy, scary guy who's wandering around in the back country of South Carolina
and people are saying, 'Colonel,' [laughs],--wow--and people usually loved
that. This made him happy. He wrote about it in his diary because he liked it
so much; this made him a happy guy. So obviously titles, status, they're
important and they go hand in hand.</p>
<p>Now if you were in
college in the colonies--so if you were at Yale, if you were at Harvard, if you
were at King's College, which is now Columbia--these kinds of distinctions of
rank and status would have been a part of your everyday life, because when you
entered college you were listed as a member of your class in the order of your
social rank. Okay. So the person of the highest social rank is listed at the
top of the class and the person of the lowest social rank is listed at the
bottom of the class, and at commencement ceremonies or graduation ceremonies
the highest in rank was the one who got to speak the longest and give the
longest public address--and obviously because, as I've been saying, things are
less entrenched, what this meant was lots of really petty, nasty squabbling at
a lot of universities because everybody had a complaint. 'Well, I'm not on the
bottom. Well, I certainly have a better rank than him. <u>He</u> should be at
the bottom. I should be at the--'&nbsp;</p>
<p>So certainly it's a
contentious issue at colleges, and what this meant, oddly enough, is that when
the grading system--when people actually figured out that you could have a
grading system and base--judge people based on grades, then unbelievably this
was seen as a great relief. This made people really--Grades made people really,
really happy, because it meant that you could be judged based on merit and not
based on rank or social class. So you can give thanks to the democracy of
grades. Remember that during this semester. I'll remind you. Give thanks for
your grades.</p>
<p>Okay. So we've talked
about some of the similarities and differences in social rank between colonists
and people living in England.</p>
<p>I want to just take a
few minutes to talk about some assumptions about government and about rights,
about individual rights, because one of the periods of great migration to the colonies,
which was the mid-to-late-seventeenth century, was also a period in which
Parliament asserted its dominance in England. So while all Englishmen believed
in the importance of political liberty and legislative representation and the
rule of law and all of these things I've started to talk about, the colonies
were full of people who either themselves had left England or were descended
from people who had left England when that kind of belief was at an all-time
high, so colonial governments embodied that spirit to a really extreme degree.
And it's important to realize that colonial talk of liberty wasn't some kind of
colonial innovation. It was the most heartfelt of British traditions --as I've
suggested just in this lecture, and as we're going to see in future weeks--it's
the precise meaning of liberty as translated into the colonies from England--and
as this slowly shifts over time, it's going to help raise conflict between the
colonies and the mother country. But questions about the precise meaning of
liberty wouldn't really become an issue until the 1760s, after the French and
Indian War when, as we'll soon see, the British would end what had been a long
period of what's often called a period of salutary neglect, a period when the
British largely just left the colonies alone to regulate themselves.</p>
<p>And throughout that
period of neglect colonists had lived immersed in their sense of English rights
and privileges, unaware of the ways in which the colonial experience--just the
experience of living in the colonies--had suddenly altered their understanding
of these rights. They've been able to live in that kind of a freedom largely
because of the nature of the British imperial administration. Typically, rather
than exerting great control over the colonization process the British Crown
tended to leave colonization largely to private enterprise, so like a joint-stock
company would get a grant to establish a colony, and off they'd go, and it
wasn't really necessarily the Crown that had its hand on everything. It was
these private companies that were often taking care of the colonization
efforts, and on a few occasions when the Crown did pass trade regulations they
didn't enforce them very rigorously, which basically allowed widespread
smuggling and bribery. So in a sense, the success of the British imperial
system up until the 1760s was largely due to what was not really a policy, but
the absence of a policy--right?--this neglect of the colonies by the mother
country.</p>
<p>Not until the British
began to actively regulate the colonies in the mid-eighteenth century did it
really become apparent that colonial and British ideas about the role of the
colonies and the rights of colonists had really begun to drift apart. Had the
colonists forfeited some of their English liberties by migrating to the New World
or not?&nbsp; Were they dependent on the mother country or were they just
contributors to the greater empire?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And some colonists
would come to have a clear answer to those kinds of questions. They would argue--and
we're going to see this in weeks to come, and specifically people writing this
argument and offering it to the public--that the original settlers of the
colonies had been free-born subjects of England who had left England with the
authorization of the monarchy and, taking a good many personal risks, had
created thriving English settlements at little cost to the English government,
bringing England great riches in the process.</p>
<p>So essentially some
colonists would argue not only were they English, but they made personal
sacrifices for England; they had tamed a wilderness for England, for the sake
of the empire. And ironically it would be that mentality--that kind of outcry
for the rights of Englishmen--that would help lead the colonists to revolt
against England. As we'll see, in a sense, the colonies were never as English
as when they rebelled against the mother country for the rights of Englishmen.
And I will stop there. On Tuesday we will be looking at some things that were
distinctly American about the colonial experience. Have a good weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
