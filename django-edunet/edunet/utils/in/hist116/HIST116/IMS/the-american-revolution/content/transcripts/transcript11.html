<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>But
now I will actually talk about the Declaration of Independence. Obviously, at
the core of today&#39;s lecture we have a piece of paper. Of course, it&#39;s an iconic
piece of paper to us, but it&#39;s a piece of paper just the same. And part of what
we&#39;re going to be looking at today in this lecture is that obviously this Declaration
was more than just a piece of paper produced by a bunch of guys in one room--that
actually, declaring independence was an event, and it was an event that reached
far beyond the Second Continental Congress, and actually was hashed out in
towns and cities throughout the colonies, and I&#39;ll be talking some about that
today. </p>
<p>So as you&#39;ll see
today, and it&#39;ll be logically following through other things that I&#39;ve said in
the course, what we&#39;re talking about here is a wrenching progress, a major
decision that was an act of treason, an action that the colonists knew would
set them on a dangerous path. Now given lots of the stuff I&#39;ve said so far in
this course, hopefully you&#39;re expecting--you&#39;re understanding why this would be
a wrenching process, why it would seem radical or as radical as it did. It
represented a break from the mother country that American colonists obviously
had long embraced as their own, as well as a dangerous act that set a
collection of colonies in warfare against the most powerful nation on earth. So,
big step. </p>
<p>So it&#39;s an important
act, but we need to be careful in assuming that the piece of paper that
explained its rationale had some kind of magical, iconic value at the time that
it was created, because it didn&#39;t. And as you&#39;ll see, it was not seen as the
main focus of the process of declaring independence, and in a way it was almost
seen as a formality to the actual act of declaring independence. And it wasn&#39;t
intended to say something dramatically new. It&#39;s come to mean a lot of things
over the centuries, but at the time it was not supposed to be something
radically new. </p>
<p>As Jefferson put it--And
all of these founder types, those who live who into old age, are asked
eternally through their old age to: &#39;tell us about.&#39; Right? Jefferson got all
these tell-us-about-the-Declaration letters from people. Adams got the same
kind of letters. I&#39;m going to be quoting later on from one or two of their
explanations of what happened surrounding the Declaration of Independence. But
in one of these letters when someone asked Jefferson, &#39;So how did you decide
what was going to be in the Declaration? Where did the ideas come from?&#39;--and
Jefferson said that the Declaration was, quote, &quot;neither aiming at
originality of principle or sentiment, nor yet copied from any particular and
previous writing. It was intended to be an expression of the American mind.&quot;
Okay. That was what it was--not only Jefferson intended it to be, but what he
understood the document was supposed to be doing. </p>
<p>So as we&#39;ll see in
today&#39;s lecture, the Declaration isn&#39;t filled with original thoughts beaming
out of the brain of Thomas Jefferson. Rather, it reflected American assumptions
about government and the rights of the body politic. So in essence, it
transcribed a mass of ideas that had been brought into the open and defined by
what the colonists took to be British transgressions against their rights as
colonists and as British subjects. </p>
<p>Now as I suggested in
last Thursday&#39;s lecture, the Declaration of Independence came roughly six
months after the publication of <i>Common Sense </i>in 1776, but it was by no
means the only or even the most important thing that the Congress had to do at
that time, sort of not what we would expect given that it&#39;s this iconic
document. </p>
<p>And I&#39;ll be talking
more about the other things that Congress had to do in Thursday&#39;s lecture, but
for now I&#39;ll say that by the time the Second Continental Congress met, and it
first met in May of 1775, shots had already been fired at Lexington and
Concord. So, as Thomas Paine put it, and I quoted him last week, the colonies
had been set on fire, and the Congress now faced the monumental task of
organizing some kind of either defensive effort or war effort, but whatever it
was, they had to organize it. That was going to be a big problem. It was going
to be a huge challenge. That&#39;s happening at the same time that everything that
I&#39;m talking about today is happening. So even as we&#39;re debating independence,
the Congress also has to deal with a whole range of other issues that really
are immediate and pressing and are about basically organizing a war. </p>
<p>So not surprisingly,
given that British soldiers had killed some colonists in Massachusetts in April
of 1775, when the Second Continental Congress came into session in May there
was already a strong feeling of colonial unity and what at the time they called
<i>rage militaire</i>, right?--this sort of fervent support of the colonial
cause. </p>
<p>And you can see the
mood of the colonists generally in the treatment that they gave the
congressional delegates as they traveled down to Philadelphia for the meeting.
So as Samuel Adams and John Hancock traveled down from Massachusetts and they
met up with delegates from Connecticut and New York as they went south, all
along their way local militia units came out to accompany them and seemingly to
protect them from the British. It&#39;s not like actually the British were going to
jump out from Connecticut and shoot down the delegates to the Continental
Congress, but still the impulse was there. These militia came out to guard the
delegates heading down to Congress. And all along the route people came out to
watch these delegates as they passed by and greeted them with shouts of
&quot;huzzah.&quot; </p>
<p>Okay, huzzah. Huzzah
is the eighteenth-century equivalent of hooray--huzzah, which is very somehow
eighteenth-century sounding. I don&#39;t know. Hooray with a Z in it just doesn&#39;t
sound very modern, and I have to--what pops into my head is, a million years
ago actually I had a huzzah moment, I had a personal huzzah moment, in which I
was invited to some big black-tie celebration of a founder who shall go
nameless. And at the founder sort of celebration, all--we&#39;re all in our long
dresses and tuxedos, a black-tie event--the organizer actually got us all to
stand and yelled three huzzahs for the founder. So there&#39;s a group of all these
very formal people going &quot;Huzzah.&quot; [laughs] So even now it feels
ridiculous to me, but even at the time, I thought--yeah, you just--you haven&#39;t
lived as an eighteenth-century historian until you&#39;ve had the chance to scream
&quot;huzzah&quot; in honor of a Founding Father so I had my huzzah moment.
There is my huzzah moment. There&#39;s an explanation of huzzah. </p>
<p>We have a lot of
huzzahing going for the delegations as they&#39;re heading down to Philadelphia. So
in all of that huzzahing you can see that the colonial cause is not an isolated
effort being managed by a few dozen men in a room. To all of these people at
the time, just after Lexington and Concord, the mere existence of the Congress,
which was a body formed by all of the colonies together, was proof of colonial
unity, so it had great significance even just on that most basic level. And
actually, although people didn&#39;t know it at the time, the Continental Congress
would end up being the sole government for the colonies until 1781 when the
Articles of Confederation end up being ratified, and obviously I&#39;ll talk more
about that in a lecture to come. </p>
<p>Now in Thursday&#39;s
lecture on <i>Common Sense </i>I mentioned some of the efforts of the Second
Continental Congress to reach reconciliation with Britain and, as I&#39;ve already
said, the delegates did not arrive in Philadelphia assuming that they were
supposed to be working for independence. They were working at reconciliation.
Now of course, as I&#39;ve just explained, they were also worrying about organizing
armed forces for defensive purposes and they were pursuing these two sort of
conflicting motives at the same time. So they are thinking about reconciliation
and worrying about defense as--well, as--In case that doesn&#39;t work, we really
better worry about that. So we can&#39;t take independence for granted. </p>
<p>We also shouldn&#39;t
take colonial unity for granted because yes, there is this <i>rage militaire</i>,
people are united because of Lexington and Concord, but if you look up close at
the Continental Congress you can see some of the ways in which it really wasn&#39;t
one united body, but it really did represent independent bodies, independent
colonies joining together for the moment. </p>
<p>So one example:
There was actually no single method set to determine how many delegates should
attend from each colony. So basically each colony decided on its own how many
people it felt like sending to the Second Continental Congress. So Virginia
sent seven men and they seemed to have some kind of rotation system so that
guys always seemed to be coming and going. Well, we&#39;ve got these guys there.
Let&#39;s take them home and bring these new guys there. No one else really knew
the system of what was happening in Virginia, but they always had people there.
They just changed a lot. New York ultimately appointed twelve men but they
didn&#39;t come really reliably, and so ultimately New York decided that you only
needed to have three of them present to vote. Okay. So first of all, obviously
attendance is a little quirky, but beyond that every colony is deciding on its
own how many people it wants to send. </p>
<p>So you can really see
how the Continental Congress is a body encapsulating delegations from separate
and distinct colonies. And before anything really major could be done,
delegations either needed to confer on their own or, more often, I suppose,
confer with people back home in their colony to determine what it was that
their colony wanted them to do. And obviously the different ideas and biases
and interests in the various colonies were different enough to make some
decisions extremely difficult. So you&#39;ve got a pretty distinctive kind of
legislative body. </p>
<p>And, as I mentioned
on Thursday, one of the notable things that this congress produced was the
Olive Branch Petition, which was this one final stab at reconciliation. The
Olive Branch Petition was approved on July 5, 1775, in the hope of ending
bloodshed. The Petition walked a delicate line, declaring loyalty to the King--not
talking about rights or making demands--and asking for the King&#39;s assistance in
reaching some kind of reconciliation. So it&#39;s appealing to the loyal--There&#39;s
people saying they&#39;re loyal to the King, they&#39;re not raging about rights and
demands, but they are asking for assistance in helping somehow to smooth things
over. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the
petition reached the King at the same time as news of Bunker Hill, okay, one of
those unfortunate strikes of fate. So not surprisingly, the Petition did not
have a wonderfully convincing impact on the Crown, and in August of 1775 the King
declared the colonies to be in rebellion. And basically he ignored--as I
mentioned also in the last lecture--he ignored the Olive Branch Petition and by
doing so, basically played into the hands of more radical colonists by making
reconciliation seem pretty unlikely and really almost demanding some more
dramatic action from the colonies. </p>
<p>So August of 1775,
George III declares the colonies in rebellion. He also did two other things at
roughly that time, neither one of which helped the situation or certainly
helped to smooth it over at all. So number one, two months later in October of
1775, he stated in Parliament that the American rebellion was, quote,
&quot;carried on for the purpose of establishing an independent empire,&quot;
and this is October 1775; you&#39;re not in 1776 yet. The King explained that &quot;the
authors and promoters of this desperate conspiracy. . . meant only to amuse, by
vague expressions of attachment to the parent state, and the strongest
protestations of loyalty to me, whilst they are preparing for a general revolt.&quot;
Okay. First of all, it sounds like he actually saw that Petition. Right? Yeah,
yeah. They&#39;re claiming we&#39;re so loyal to you and then at the same time there is
a &quot;desperate conspiracy&quot; lurking. </p>
<p>So the King is
arguing that actually, already they&#39;re planning revolt, and he says you could
see this because the colonists are raising troops, because they&#39;d seized the
public revenue, because they were trying to seize governmental powers. Not all
members of Parliament agreed with this sort of conspiracy theory on the part of
the King. Those who supported the American cause argued that the American
colonies had not yet declared themselves in revolt. They had not said that
they were rebelling; they had not said that they wanted independence yet; and
by speaking as he was, the King could very well push the colonies into more
radical action than they had yet declared in 1775. But the majority of Members
of Parliament at the time supported the King&#39;s statement, supported his
actions. </p>
<p>So first he declares
the colonies in rebellion, second he makes this bold statement in Parliament,
and then finally third, in December of 1775 he proposed and Parliament passed a
Prohibitory Act. And the Prohibitory Act prohibited commerce with the colonies,
period, and said that colonial ships were no longer under British protection. So
basically, colonial American ships are fair game on the open seas. Okay. That&#39;s--Clearly,
there is another bold sort of slap on the part of the Crown. </p>
<p>When news of these
actions arrived in the colonies in January and February of 1776, many colonists
were pushed towards really serious consideration of independence for the first
time. They&#39;re at least considering it, aided of course, as I explained last
week, by <i>Common Sense. </i>The Prohibitory Act was particularly upsetting to
many because it made it lawful to attack and raid American ships. As John
Hancock put it in a pretty obvious statement, &quot;The making all our Vessels
lawful Prize don&#39;t look like a reconciliation.&quot; [laughs] Thank you, John
Hancock. [laughs] And you&#39;re right. John Adams went further, stating that the
Prohibitory Act should be called, quote, &quot;the act of independency,&quot;
because it &quot;makes us independent in spite of our supplications and
entreaties.&quot; </p>
<p>Despite that kind of
statement, it is important to remember, regardless of how logical even at this
moment independence seems to us, we still need to go through a process here.
We&#39;re still--It&#39;s still not an obvious choice, and there were lots of questions
hovering with the mere thought of independence. What kind of a future does
declaring independence hold? Many well realized that that kind of a
declaration would bring with it a devastating war with Great Britain, death and
destruction of various kinds, and then quite possibly, even probably, defeat. </p>
<p>And on top of these
pretty logical fears, even as independence seemed--at least it&#39;s part of debate
if not absolutely looming on the horizon--most colonists still assumed they&#39;re
fighting for British rights despite the fact that clearly their understanding
of the British constitution and colonial rights is differing by this point from
the understanding of those same things in England. Most colonists still had so
deep a connection with the mother country that independence almost felt like a
physical condition. And John Dickinson, who was a moderate at this period,
basically put that into words and said that by declaring independence the
colonies were being &quot;torn from the body, to which we are united by
religion, liberty, laws, affections, relation, language and commerce,&quot; so
it&#39;s almost a physical ripping away. </p>
<p>So this is the
atmosphere in which <i>Common Sense </i>comes out, and by swaying large
portions of the people towards independence obviously that pamphlet is
extremely important. One of the most important things about it is that because
it swayed large groups of people--it wasn&#39;t just a highfalutin&#39; political
pamphlet written for the elite, but it really, as I mentioned already, was for
the masses--that it enabled the Continental Congress to consider independence
and ultimately to move toward independence as representatives of the popular
will. Right? So <i>Common Sense </i>is swaying the people, and so the
Continental Congress now is basically acting on the popular will. Some who
favored independence actually wanted to distribute <i>Common Sense </i>at the Congress&#39;s
expense, since it was so useful in arousing public sentiment to move towards
independence. </p>
<p>Now I want to turn at
this point to something that often gets left behind or left out when we talk
about declaring independence, but it&#39;s actually really crucial and in a way I
think it&#39;s really at the center of the story. And what I want to talk about is
what people generally in the colonies thought about independence, because
obviously it&#39;s not only guys in the Continental Congress who are debating,
discussing and considering independence. And even there, there was great
recognition that they&#39;re acting on behalf of the larger populace. Many colonial
delegations felt compelled to have direct orders from the people of their
colony before taking this kind of an enormous step. </p>
<p>And there&#39;s a book by
Pauline Maier which is titled <i>American Scripture: Making the Declaration of
Independence </i>and it makes this point really well, and this sort of larger
point that I&#39;m going to make here is partly drawn from her book. And she
emphasizes that the Continental Congress wasn&#39;t the sole focal point for
discussion of independence, and she explains in her book that while she was
studying what was going on in the colonies during the months of April, May,
June, and July of 1776 she actually discovered over ninety other declarations
of independence, all of them written by local communities or towns or at
conventions representing individual colonies. </p>
<p>And as she states in
her book, these local declarations of independence get us as close as we can to
the voice of the colonial public on the eve of independence. And actually just
looking at the process of creating these local declarations reveals a vast
amount of information about how the people at large were mobilized; how
seriously many colonies took the idea that the people at large had to request
independence, that the delegates in the Continental Congress were representing
them in just the way I suppose that the colonists felt Parliament was not. </p>
<p>So for example, in
Massachusetts the assembly asked individual towns throughout the colony to have
meetings to discuss--and this is a quote from the document that the assembly
sent to all of these towns, &quot;if the honorable Continental Congress should
decide that, for the safety of the United Colonies, it was necessary to declare
them independent of Great Britain, would they &#39;solemnly engage with their Lives
and Fortunes to Support the Congress in the Measure?&quot; Okay. So the
assembly is sending this and saying, &#39;Towns, you need to consider this
resolution. If the Continental Congress decides that it makes sense to declare
independence, will you actually support that with your lives and your
fortunes? Is that something you&#39;re in favor of?&#39; </p>
<p>Obviously, it&#39;s being
treated like, really in a sense, a personal decision, a highly significant
decision. Colonists are asked--are being asked by this statement to join in
groups and discuss independence and decide what it is they think should happen
next. And clearly, that kind of statement also reveals that they&#39;re aware of
the seriousness and they&#39;re aware--I mean, ultimately, this is an act of
treason that&#39;s being debated here. </p>
<p>Now the Massachusetts
assembly thought that--they&#39;re asking towns to vote--that this might not be
necessarily a really lengthy process, since already there&#39;s a lot of
circulating talk about maybe what should come next, but actually it wasn&#39;t
until July that all of the towns reported themselves in favor of independence.
The process took that long, it took months, because people actually were
seriously debating the issue. As a man from one town observed, independence
was, quote, &quot;the greatest and most important question that ever came
before this town.&quot; </p>
<p>Now of course by the
time that every town had reported what it thought in Massachusetts to the
Continental Congress, the Congress had already decided in favor of
independence, but the people were a part of this decision-making process. And
if the first towns from Massachusetts had not supported independence, the
Massachusetts delegates might have had a hard time promoting it in Philadelphia,
so it mattered. </p>
<p>In Maryland as well,
there was widespread participation in this decision about whether independence
ought to be declared, and individual popular declarations supporting
independence there were possibly even more important than in Massachusetts,
because the Maryland congressional delegation was undecided in what it thought
about independence. And it wasn&#39;t until the Maryland government received these
declarations of independence from towns in Maryland that they decided to
instruct the delegates in the Congress to support independence. </p>
<p>Some colonies like--At
this point I should just wait for the response. Which colony might have a
quirky response? Right? Rhode Island. Somewhere out there in the filming land--They&#39;re
filming this--There&#39;s going to be a lot of Rhode Island people who are going to
be really mad [laughs] at me for saying negative things about Rhode Island, and
yet here we have Rhode Island again. Rhode Island did not have such widespread
participation. There was a logic to what went on in Rhode Island. Apparently,
in Rhode Island the legislature did consider asking towns what they thought
about independence, but they did a little investigation first and they
discovered that it was possible that a few towns in Rhode Island might vote
against independence. Okay. Rhode Island wisely thought: if we ask people what
they think and they say, &#39;We don&#39;t want independence,&#39; this could be a bad
thing, and so they decided that wasn&#39;t necessarily the best plan; it certainly
wouldn&#39;t help the common cause. </p>
<p>Now when I discuss
colonial legislatures at this point, it&#39;s important to realize that most of the
royal colonial governments had pretty much collapsed by this point. The
Continental Congress in May of 1776 thus instructed the colonies to form new
governments, and so roughly throughout this period--some of the colonies had
already started doing this before May, some of them waited until May--but
throughout this period, in a lot of the colonies there was some kind of a
convention debating what basically the new government, and really in a way, the
new constitution of these colonies should be in the absence of having a royal
presence. So they&#39;re like little mini colonial constitutional conventions, and
it was these conventions often that were receiving these local declarations of
independence. </p>
<p>And to some people in
the colonies it was actually this resolution asking the colonies to create
their own governments that constituted the real declaration of independence,
and you can even hear echoes of the later official Declaration in the
resolution itself asking the colonies to make their own governments. It has a
preamble, a very radical preamble, that&#39;s certainly more radical than anything
that the Congress had said thus far: </p>
<p>&quot;Whereas His
Britannic Majesty, in conjunction with the lords and commons of Great Britain,
has, by a late act of parliament, excluded the inhabitants of these United Colonies
from the protection of his crown; And whereas no answer whatever, to the humble
petitions of the colonies for redress of grievances and reconciliation with
Great Brittain has been, or is likely to be given, but the whole force of that
kingdom, aided by foreign mercenaries, is to be exerted for the destruction of
the good people of these colonies ... it is necessary, that the exercise of
every kind of authority under the said crown should be totally suppressed, and
all the powers of government exerted, under the authority of the people of the
colonies for the preservation of internal peace, virtue and good order, as well
as for the defense of their lives, liberties, and properties.&quot; </p>
<p>So that&#39;s a radical
statement. To Adams--To John Adams as well as many others, this pretty much
constituted a declaration of independence even though it didn&#39;t declare
independence officially, and it&#39;s significant that in that preface Congress
isn&#39;t attacking the King&#39;s ministers; they&#39;re not attacking Parliament. They&#39;re
attacking the King himself, which is almost as good as a formal declaration of
revolt. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the
colonies the individual towns are debating what they want to do about
independence. They&#39;re expressing their opinions in written statements that, as
Pauline Maier points out, were remarkably alike in tone and content. A lot of
them listed the same grievances and had the same kind of sense of betrayal at
how the King had betrayed them. Most of them mentioned the contempt with which
the King had received their attempts at reconciliation. They mentioned recent
violence and destruction of American property by British troops. They of course
mentioned the Prohibitory Act, which declared the colonists out of British
protection. They mentioned German mercenaries hired by George III to fight the
colonists. </p>
<p>And most of them had
sort of a personal tone that they adopted towards the King, blaming him
personally for the present state of affairs and expressing great sadness at
their realization that their monarch basically had fallen to this level and
allowed this to happen. Some petitions went even further, suggesting the type
of government that they prefer to be there in place of the monarchy, and in one
way or another some of these declarations specified they wanted to establish a
republican government in the colonies; they wanted governments grounded on
popular will and actual representation. </p>
<p>So what we&#39;re seeing
here is average people in towns throughout the colonies immersed in the current
state of affairs, committing themselves personally to a course of action,
expressing their ideas about what government should be, and personally taking
part in the political process in a radical kind of a way. So obviously we&#39;re
not talking about a couple of dozen men in a room in Philadelphia. Now, news of
these declarations written in May, June and even as late as July helped push
the Continental Congress towards independence, so let&#39;s move back to Congress. </p>
<p>On June 7, 1776,
Virginia took a major step forward by making a resolution that it sent to its
delegates in Philadelphia via Richard Henry Lee--he was one of the delegates--and
the resolution from Virginia said that the delegates should promote
independence because the colonies, quote, &quot;are, and of right, ought to be,
free and independent States.&quot; Bang. So there you have it. But the
response--Okay. There it is, we should be independent, the resolution that&#39;s
going to push them to debate independence. </p>
<p>The response to that
resolution is a reminder that there were a lot of other things that were more
pressing at the time. So Richard Henry Lee presents this to Congress and
Congress says, &#39;We got to put it off until tomorrow because we actually have
more important things that we need to debate today first, so we&#39;ll talk about
independence tomorrow.&#39; Thank you, Richard Henry Lee. On to these other matters.
</p>
<p>So the next day, June
8, debate on independence got under way, and those who were less enthusiastic
about independence, men like John Dickinson, who is moderate in his politics,
or James Wilson, also of Pennsylvania, Edward Rutledge of South Carolina, they
said that they were friends to the idea but that the time wasn&#39;t yet right.
Some colonial delegations weren&#39;t yet ready to declare independence. They
didn&#39;t have permission to declare it from their home governments, and forcing
the issue might force these colonies to secede from what was already a
relatively weak colonial union or so they argued. So--and disunion--if that
were to happen, if they were to push independence and a colony should pull out,
disunion would be disastrous to their cause, not only because it would hurt the
cause, but it would certainly not encourage foreign nations to potentially help
these little colonies in fighting against Great Britain. </p>
<p>So this is what
Rutledge--Edward Rutledge of South Carolina wrote on June 10. </p>
<p>&quot;The congress
sat till 7 o&#39;clock this evening in consequence of a motion of R[ichard] H[enry]
Lee&#39;s rendering ourselves free and independent States. The sensible part of the
House opposed the Motion.... they saw no Wisdom in a Declaration of
independence, nor any other Purpose to be enforced by it, but placing ourselves
in the Power of those with whom we mean to treat, giving our Enemy Notice of
our Intentions before we have taken any steps to execute them and thereby
enabling them to counteract us in our Intentions and rendering ourselves
ridiculous in the Eyes of foreign powers by attempting to bring them into a Union
with us before we had united with each other.&quot; </p>
<p>Okay. There&#39;s a lot
of strong arguments Rutledge is presenting, but of course on the other side of
the spectrum, those who supported independence argued that without a formal
declaration of independence no nation would be willing to aid the colonies; the
colonies were basically independent already; the matter needs to be discussed,
needs to be pushed forward. </p>
<p>Lack of agreement and
the importance of the decision led Congress to postpone the decision until the
first week of July so that individual colonies could decide on a course of
action. And in the meantime, so no time would be lost, they appointed a
committee to compose a written statement formally declaring colonial
independence, and the committee included John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin
Franklin, the greatest hits--Roger Sherman of Connecticut, and Robert R.
Livingston, one of the many Livingstons of New York. </p>
<p>And ultimately the
committee appointed Jefferson to draft the document and he worked during the
last two weeks of June in 1776. Now as I mentioned at the start of the lecture,
in later years, when Adams and Jefferson were retired presidential types, lots
of people wrote to them asking, &#39;So tell us what really happened with the
Declaration of Independence. What was it like? Why did you do X? Did you
really do X? What was he like?&#39;--sort of all the things that you would want to
ask if you could ask these people, &#39;What really happened?&#39; And both men
offered accounts of the writing of the Declaration and their accounts do not
necessarily agree--and they&#39;re also pretty in character for each one of these
men, particularly John Adams&#39; account of what happened with the decision about
who was going to write the Declaration of Independence. </p>
<p>And actually in 1822,
Adams wrote a pretty lengthy explanation of how Jefferson was chosen to write
the Declaration. I just want to offer you a little piece of it, because it&#39;s
actually a pretty amazing little re-creation. So Adams writes in his letter,
&quot;You inquire why so young a man as Mr. Jefferson was placed at the head of
the Committee for preparing a Declaration of Independence.&quot; Okay. So there
is what the person wrote. So Adams, why did you pick that young new guy to
write this document? Adams says, </p>
<p>&quot;I answer . . . Mr.
Jefferson came into Congress, in June, 1775, and brought with him a reputation
for literature, science, and a happy talent of composition. Writings of his
were handed about, remarkable for the peculiar felicity of expression. Though a
silent member in Congress, he was so prompt, frank, explicit, and decisive upon
committees and in conversation, not even Samuel Adams was more so, that he soon
seized upon my heart; and upon this occasion I gave him my vote, and did all in
my power to procure the votes of others.&quot; </p>
<p>Okay. So in the end
the committee&#39;s voting who should write it, and Adams and Jefferson get the
most votes to write the declaration, so they&#39;re made, according to Adams, like
a little subcommittee of Adams and Jefferson, and now this subcommittee
supposedly is going to draft the Declaration. So Adams continues, &quot;The sub-committee
met. Jefferson proposed to me to make the draught. I said &#39;I will not.&#39;&quot; </p>
<p>And what I&#39;m going to
be reading from here now--it&#39;s my favorite part of the story--he wrote a little
script with what Jefferson says and what he responds. He&#39;s no longer even
himself in the letter. He&#39;s just recording: he said and then I said, and that
he said and then I said. So Jefferson says, &#39;Adams, you should write it,&#39; and
Adams says, &quot;I will not.&quot; &quot;You should do it,&quot; Jefferson
insists. &quot;Oh! no,&quot; says Adams. &quot;Why will you not?,&quot; asks
Jefferson. &quot;You ought to do it.&quot; Its like he&#39;s writing a film. [laughs]
He&#39;s already imagining: the movie of my life. [laughs] If movies existed, I
would be imagining the movie of my life. &quot;You ought to do it,&quot; says
Jefferson. &quot;I will not.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Reasons
enough.&quot; &quot;What can be your reasons?&quot; </p>
<p>Okay. This is Adams&#39;
response. &quot;Reason first--You are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to
appear at the head of this business. Reason second--I am obnoxious, [laughs/laughter]
suspected, and unpopular.&quot; Oh, [laughs] poor John Adams. I am obnoxious,
suspected and unpopular. Don&#39;t make me write the document. &quot;You are very
much otherwise.&quot; &quot;Reason third--You can write ten times better than
I can.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; Adams has Jefferson respond, &quot;if you are
decided, I will do it as well as I can.&quot; Okay. That&#39;s part of a really
lengthy, great letter by Adams. </p>
<p>Jefferson&#39;s account
is much less humorous and actually briefer, and he writes in 1823 to James
Madison and he says, &quot;No such thing as a subcommittee was proposed&quot; [laughs]--it&#39;s
like--oops, a basic disagreement--&quot;but they unanimously pressed on myself
alone to undertake the draught.&quot; Okay, a little disagreement between the
two guys which they never really agreed upon. And then he goes on to discuss in
this letter whether the ideas in the Declaration were new or not, and he says, &#39;No,
no. American minds,&#39; blah blah blah.</p>
<p>Okay. Regardless of
the precise details as to whether there was or wasn&#39;t a subcommittee, Jefferson
did draft the Declaration. He submitted it to the others for comment. They
commented on it. They sort of discussed it amongst themselves. You&#39;ll get some
chance in section to actually talk about some of the real specifics of the
document, the Declaration of Independence. </p>
<p>For the moment, I&#39;ll
just mention briefly what were some of Jefferson&#39;s sources. Right? He&#39;s sitting
in Philadelphia. He has basically two weeks--talk about a paper deadline--to
write the Declaration of Independence. What is going to use? He&#39;s pretty
pressed for time, so logically he turned to whatever he could for fodder, and
two notable sources were both Virginia documents logically enough. He drafted a
constitution for Virginia, since the colony is in the middle of doing that and
along with everything else, and that ended up being a source for him of some of
the grievances, the long list of grievances in the Declaration. He pulled some
of them from that. And then the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was also
part of this constitution-making process, helped contribute to the preamble of
the Declaration. </p>
<p>Now of course,
Jefferson was careful not just to focus on Virginia words, Virginia charges,
Virginia things, because obviously the document is supposed to represent all of
the colonies. So for example, when you read the Declaration, you could see some
of the things he&#39;s citing happened in Massachusetts--and some of them actually
happened in other colonies as well. It needs to be something that is coming
from some united expression of the colonial will. </p>
<p>One of the passages
that ultimately did not end up displaying colonial unity not surprisingly
concerned slavery--so in Jefferson&#39;s draft he actually has a passage that
charges the King--that the King, quote, had &quot;waged cruel war against human
nature itself, violating it&#39;s most sacred rights of life &amp; liberty in the
persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating &amp; carrying
them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their
transportation thither.&quot; Okay. So that&#39;s a notable attempt to blame the King
for slavery, but the passage ultimately gets stricken out by the Congress, in
part for obvious reasons. Right? The South is not going to support this. </p>
<p>But also, ultimately
Jefferson&#39;s declaration as far as slavery is concerned had some tortured logic
in it, because it first attacks the King for creating slavery, for transporting
slaves to America, and then attacks him for offering them freedom if they fight
for the British. You inflicted slavery upon us and you are threatening to free
the slaves. Okay. Continental Congress said, &#39;Okay. Not only is the South not
really able to grasp this at this particular moment, but this doesn&#39;t entirely
match up, Jefferson.&#39; So in a sense his ambiguity and ambivalence reflected
general ambiguity and ambivalence. </p>
<p>But in the end, the
total effect of all of these charges was to suggest that the King had sort of
de-kinged himself. He had displaced himself--that he and not the colonies, had
brought events to where they now stood. </p>
<p>Now, I think
generally we and also often scholars tend to really focus on the preamble of
the Declaration, but in fact at the time, it was the specific charges against
the King that were considered to be the real meat of the document. The preamble
was actually just supposed to be a preamble to the real charges against the King,
which were the radical part of the document at the time. And since this
document was intended possibly to be a declaration for foreign audiences as
well as domestic audiences, it was important that that preamble be a statement,
a broad, sweeping statement of epic proportions, to inspire people to support
the cause. </p>
<p>The committee&#39;s draft
ultimately was presented to Congress on June 28, and then debating and editing
began on July 1. Some of the changes had to do with specific word choices--so
for example was the King really guilty of, quote, &quot;unremitting
injuries&quot;? Congress preferred &quot;repeated injuries.&quot; Okay. That
was the level of editing taking place with the Declaration. So they thought
well, &quot;repeated&quot; is a little less extreme than
&quot;unremitting.&quot; That word gets changed. </p>
<p>Not all of the
changes were intended to tame the document. Sometimes Congress made some of
Jefferson&#39;s charges more extreme, as when they added to Jefferson&#39;s statement
about foreign mercenaries words that described it--the act of sending them to
the colonies--as, quote, &quot;scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous
ages.&quot; And then as I mentioned before, they struck the entire passage on
slavery. For the--For many southern delegates pretty much it was a deal
breaker, and it happens so often in this period. We&#39;ll certainly come up with
it again at the--towards the end of this course. The issue of slavery comes up.
It can&#39;t be dealt with. People don&#39;t know how to deal with it, particularly the
Southerners, and it keeps getting shunted to the side, and so in a sense that&#39;s
what happens here. </p>
<p>I&#39;m going to stop at
this point, and I will start with a story that should be here, but I can&#39;t tell
it here and I want to do it justice, about Jefferson&#39;s response to the editing
of his precious draft. He was not a happy camper at the editing of the
Declaration of Independence. And then I will move on to really discussing
organizing a war. <br />
