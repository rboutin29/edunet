<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>Someone
asked me at the end of class on Tuesday a very good question, and the question
is: what exactly is a broadside? So I was here sort of happily like: &#39;oh, yes,
they&#39;re posting broadsides, don&#39;t buy tea,&#39; and I never really precisely
defined what a broadside was. A broadside is actually a single sheet of paper
that something is printed on one side and it would have been posted in public
or handed out in public in town squares or taverns, and usually they were
advertising things or announcing things that were of immediate, pressing
importance like immediate news, pressing news, political events, official
proclamations, great entertainment or whatever. They were sort of immediate
news and they were not really seen as great permanent documents. They were seen
as something that you posted up, you handed out, you read it for the day or
whatever and then it would be discarded, so that was these broadsides that I
was talking about. &#39;The detested tea has arrived at our port&#39; would have been
that kind of an announcement. It would have been an immediate like: &#39;the tea&#39;s
here now, do something,&#39; kind of an instant announcement. So that&#39;s what a
broadside is. </p>
<p>Okay. So today we are
going to make our way to what on the syllabus I have called the logic of
resistance, and what I mean by that is the mindset that contributed to some of
the broad conclusions that the colonists were drawing as events were unfolding
in the 1770s as we&#39;ve seen in the last few lectures. But to get to the logic of
resistance we first have to lay out another event that contributed to the
building of that logic. And I mentioned it right at the end of the last lecture--and
that event is a series of acts that were passed by Parliament in 1774, and
Americans ended up calling them the Intolerable Acts, which will be an easy way
to remember what they are, the Intolerable Acts. They also were called the
Coercive Acts but intolerable would have been what Americans--what the
colonists would have considered them. </p>
<p>And I mentioned them
right at the end of the last lecture. As you remember, they were a response to
the destruction of the tea in Boston Harbor, which sort of dumbfounded Lord
North who had assumed that his Tea Act, passed in 1773, was going to be seen as
maybe a relief by the colonies; that North had been trying to save the East
India Company from going under; he had reduced duties on East India tea so that
people would be buying that tea, passed the act, thought this would be seen
potentially as a good thing--only to find that the colonists saw it as an
attempt of the British government to have a monopoly over what the colonists
had assumed was free trade. And that&#39;s where you get the broadsides that I was
just talking about, telling people not to buy or sell East India tea and to act
now, defend your liberties. And then eventually you end up with the
destruction of tea in Boston Harbor. And as I mentioned in the last lecture, &quot;Boston
Tea Party&quot; is actually later in the nineteenth century. They didn&#39;t call it
this at the time. They probably called it &quot;the destruction of the tea,&quot;
but it was not a party [laughs] at the time. That was later they decided it was
a tea party. </p>
<p>So now clearly,
having had that happen, North felt that something really needed to be done
about the colonies, or obedience to British law and order, in his mind, would
collapse in the colonies. As he put it, and I think I quoted this right at the
end of the lecture, that if they didn&#39;t risk something, all is over. A dramatic
statement. Thus you get the Intolerable Acts, which are passed in the spring of
1774, and although there were some in Parliament who protested against them,
still they passed with a great majority. Those who did protest against them
argued that the American colonists deserved the same rights as any other
British subjects and, as I describe the acts to you, you will understand why
these friends to America were making this argument. You&#39;ll hear the details and
see that their argument certainly made sense at that moment. </p>
<p>So there were four
acts that get lumped together as the Intolerable Acts. The first one: the
Boston Port Act, which closed the port of Boston to all shipping until the
colonists paid for the tea that they had destroyed, and I suppose also
hopefully showed some degree of remorse for having destroyed all that tea. Now
clearly that&#39;s a pretty extreme measure, right?--closing the port of Boston,
period. And North assumed that it would pretty much crush the opposition in
Boston and that other colonies would scramble for Boston&#39;s lost trade and
ignore what was happening in Boston. And we&#39;ll see this again and again--that
there is sort of a fundamental misunderstanding about when and what ends up
seeming like a joint threat to the colonists so that they act together versus
what doesn&#39;t inspire them to act together. So here we see Lord North assuming
that if Boston loses trade the other colonies will just sort of gobble it up
and the Boston radicals will sort of get silenced and that&#39;ll be the end of
this matter, but he misjudges colonial sentiment, in this case really
underestimating the sense of unity that arises from something that ends up
being seen as a joint threat. </p>
<p>So the British
government ends up being rather stunned when the other colonies not only don&#39;t
ignore Boston but instead they actually support it in its time of need. So
other colonies responded to the Boston Port Act and some of these other acts by
sending goods. So Connecticut sent sheep, Charleston sent rice, Philadelphia
sent flour. So the other colonies basically stepped up and did something in
Boston&#39;s time of need and a lot of colonies made June 1, which is the day that
that act was supposed to take effect, a day of fasting and prayer. </p>
<p>Now clearly some of
this was because people felt sympathy for what was happening in Boston; they
saw and felt for Boston and its plight. But equally if not more important,
people in other colonies assumed if it could happen in Boston, it could happen
anywhere. So in a lot of ways, Boston&#39;s cause was their cause. It wasn&#39;t
something happening far away. It was something that there was no reason why
they couldn&#39;t see it couldn&#39;t happen anywhere else where the British government
happened to be angry at something that happened. </p>
<p>So in essence Lord
North&#39;s actions did the precise opposite of what they were meant to do, because
they really ultimately brought the colonies closer together in a shared sense
of crisis. As George Washington put it in his typical kind of meandering,
indirect way--Washington is not always the best wordsmith. Washington had very
good people writing for him. He had good speech makers, that Washington, but he
tends to write in kind of a meandering style, and this will be kind of a
typical Washingtonian statement full of parenthesis and weird clauses, but his
heart&#39;s in the right place. Okay. So Washington says, &quot;The ministry,&quot;
the British ministry, &quot;may rely on it, the Americans will never be tax&#39;d
without their own consent[,] that the cause of Boston[,] the despotick Measures
in respect to it I mean[,] now is and ever will be considerd as the cause of
America (not that we approve their conduct in destroying the Tea),&quot; this
is all one sentence [laughs]--and that &quot;we shall not suffer ourselves to
be sacrificed by piece meals though god only knows what is to become of
us.&quot; It&#39;s sort of a Washingtonian sentence but still, he&#39;s making his
point really clearly. </p>
<p>So the Boston Port
Act, number one of the Intolerable Acts. The other three--still pretty largely
focused on Massachusetts--included a Quartering Act, and the Quartering Act
legalized the quartering of British troops not only in empty buildings or
taverns but also in private homes; the Administration of Justice Act, which was
an attempt to protect people who were trying to suppress revolts in the
colonies. So the Administration of Justice Act said that if a fair trial for a
British soldier or official couldn&#39;t be had in Massachusetts, the trial could
be transferred to another colony or to England. And in Massachusetts, the land
of propaganda, this became known as the Murder Act. [laughs] Just in case you
want to wonder what people are thinking about it. And as someone at the time
put it, &quot;Every villain who ravishes our wives [or] deflowers our daughters,
can evade punishment by being tried in Britain, where no evidence can pursue
him.&quot; Okay. We&#39;re not really talking so much about ravishing and
deflowering. We&#39;re really talking about [laughs] taxes and such--but still, you
could understand the logic why people feel that--again--some fundamental
liberties are being violated here. </p>
<p>And then finally the
last of these acts is the Massachusetts Government Act, and in a lot of ways
that ended up being the most controversial act of all, because it basically imposed
a new charter on the colony of Massachusetts. From now on, the governor, who
was appointed by the King, could appoint his own council rather than having the
council be elected by the colonial assembly; the council could no longer veto
the governor&#39;s decisions; all town meetings besides the one annual meeting for
electing officers now needed to be approved by the governor, and if the
governor wanted he could simply forbid town meetings; and any additional
meeting besides the one in which officers were chosen--that meeting needed to
post an agenda in advance and stick to the agenda; and the governor also now
could appoint or remove sheriffs, judges, attorney generals, marshals. So
basically the governor is a royal official and the governor is now in Massachusetts
being given a lot of power. </p>
<p>So I&#39;ll repeat the
four Intolerable Acts: the Boston Port Act, the Quartering Act, the
Administration of Justice Act, and the Massachusetts Government Act. So having
described those acts, you can see why there would have been some in Parliament
who were sympathetic to what was going on in the colonies who would have
protested that these acts were depriving colonists of some pretty basic British
constitutional rights, but these protestors were in the minority. </p>
<p>Now on top of these
acts the King sent a new governor to Massachusetts, Massachusetts General
Thomas Gage, commander of the British forces in North America. Okay. So a
military commander was sent to be the new governor--again, a pretty dramatic
statement. So now in addition to all of those acts, you have the looming threat
certainly to the colonies or the colonists in Massachusetts of a standing army
as a source of tyranny staring them in the face. So certainly people in
Massachusetts at this moment would have been justified in feeling as though
they were under military occupation. </p>
<p>Now we may look at
these pretty drastic measures and assume that reconciliation is pretty
impossible at this point. And I know a few of you came up to me after class on
Tuesday and actually were already leaning in that direction--like, &#39;when are we
getting the independence, because how in the world can they get out of this?&#39;
Right? [laughs] &#39;It&#39;s looking pretty bad. Look at these really extreme
measures.&#39; Certainly it looks as though rebellion is on the horizon. </p>
<p>But independence is
not the natural choice. That&#39;s a really, really radical move that is not at
this moment on the horizon. These are really--And I&#39;m going to talk more about
this in this lecture a little further on. These are British subjects trying to
demand the rights of British subjects. That&#39;s the logic that&#39;s at play here.
They&#39;re not thinking independence. They&#39;re thinking that they need to find a
way to get the British imperial system to work in a way that they see as being
right. They&#39;re not trying to break away. They&#39;re hoping that there&#39;s a way to
fix things, and that they will get what they feel they deserve as British
subjects. </p>
<p>So in 1774, it was in
the hope of maybe figuring out some way to settle things, some way to
compromise, some way to come to some sort of a solution that the Massachusetts
legislature sent a circular letter to the other colonies suggesting that it
might be smart to have a joint congress from all the colonies to discuss their
problems and to figure out a course of action that made sense. So what came to
be known as the First Continental Congress, right?--the congress of the
continent--met in Philadelphia at the end of August in 1774. Most of the
delegates to that Congress already had some political experience in their
separate colonies. None of them were absolute uncompromising radicals who
wanted to rip everything apart. It was not a sort of dire radical body, and
I&#39;ll be talking a little bit more about the First Continental Congress in a
lecture to come but for now, I&#39;ll just state--I guess--four significant things
about the meeting of the Congress. </p>
<p>Okay. First, and
it&#39;s actually kind of practical, the meeting of the First Continental Congress
forced the colonists to make their beliefs clear to themselves--as people from
a variety of different colonies--and to Great Britain, and to explain the
motives behind their actions as they debated and drafted petitions and resolves
and declarations. The delegates were clarifying and defining their thoughts,
and they were doing it in a room full of delegates from other colonies that
people didn&#39;t necessarily know that well. So it was actually just in and of
itself by collecting all these people together in a room and forcing them to
sort of think things through, talk things through and come up with some kind of
a resolution they were actually hashing out their problems on a broad level in
a way that they had not done before. </p>
<p>Second, a Continental
Congress forced people from very separate colonies--in a way, really sort of
separate nation-states--to meet one another and stay with one another for an
extended period of time. And for a lot of the people that were there, this was
really their first extended period spent with people from faraway colonies. So
not only did this contribute to a sense of colonial unity, but it actually on a
really practical level, it gave people a chance to see how other colonies ran
their colonial governments. And John Adams actually--He writes a great diary at
the time, and in his diary he writes about how when he&#39;s in this congress he
spent a lot of time grilling people from other colonies, asking questions about
their charters, their laws, the logic behind them. He really wanted to
understand how other colonies worked. </p>
<p>And it&#39;s interesting
because in his letters--I think also in his diary but in his letters for sure--Adams
refers to himself and his position in the Continental Congress as &quot;our
embassy,&quot; right? And by &quot;our embassy,&quot; what he means is, he
sees himself as a kind of diplomat representing Massachusetts in a sort of--today
you might say--international body, but he sees the Continental Congress as a
sort of grouping of representatives of other provinces or other countries or
nations, and he&#39;s a delegate from our embassy of Massachusetts. So in a way we
put a lot of baggage into the word &quot;congress&quot; as though, &#39;oh, it&#39;s a
bunch of Americans joined in a congress,&#39; but it&#39;s not a Congress in our modern
sense of the word. It really is in their mind a sort of delegation of people representing
different nation-states, which is why it was so interesting for them to collect
together and get to exchange thoughts. </p>
<p>And then third, to
John Adams and some others, the fact that now this Congress existed seemed to
be, or at least to hold the potential for being, some kind of a training ground
for American statesmen. And Adams put it at the time, said that the Congress
was quote, &quot;to be a School of Political Prophets I suppose--a Nursery of
American Statesmen. May it thrive, and prosper and flourish and from this Fountain
may there issue Streams, which shall gladden all the Cities and Towns in North
America, forever.&quot; John Adams always has a way of saying the big, broad
quotable thing, which is why I keep coming back to him. Hello. I will provide
you the historian with the big, broad, wonderful quote about the Continental
Congress. Thank you, John Adams. &quot;I am for making. . . [the congress]
annual, and for Sending an entire new set [of delegates] every Year, that all
the principal Genius&#39;s may go to the University in Rotation--that We may have Politicians
in Plenty. . . Our Policy must be to improve every opportunity and Means for
forming our People, and preparing Leaders for them in the grand March of Politicks.&quot;
So he&#39;s drawing a lot of big hopes for the future from the meeting of this Congress,
but certainly he&#39;s thinking--the fact that it exists and that these people will
be meeting and talking in this way on this level will be in and of itself a
sort of educational colonial experience. </p>
<p>And then finally a
fourth significant aspect of the meeting of this Congress was that at least to
some back in England the Continental Congress symbolized a move towards
rebellion. And indeed more about this to come, but in February of 1775, Lord
North passed a resolution in Parliament declaring that Massachusetts was in a
state of rebellion. And part of the reason why it&#39;s Massachusetts that he&#39;s
focusing on is because really still in Parliament, they are assuming that
Massachusetts is the ringleader of all the trouble; the real reason for the Congress
is Massachusetts; Massachusetts is the problem; Massachusetts is moving towards
rebellion; and to some people back in England looking on, this Continental
Congress looks treasonable. </p>
<p>So you can see how
things are evolving here. You can see how mutual misunderstandings are growing.
Colonists and the British administration are grappling with the real meaning of
British sovereignty in the colonies. The British government isn&#39;t really clear
on some of the logic of colonial thinking on such matters. Colonists see an
ongoing attempt to violate their fundamental rights as British subjects as they
have come to understand them, which brings us to the perfect segue into a
discussion of the logic of colonial resistance, the logic driving the colonial
mindset during the passage of the 1770s. </p>
<p>And what I&#39;m going to
do now--I&#39;m going to introduce this subject by doing something that&#39;s a little
bit illogical but I just can&#39;t resist it basically, so you are going to be
subject to it. There actually is a logic to it, but to talk about the logic of
resistance in the Revolution, I&#39;m going to use a story that actually dates to a
period significantly after the Revolution, which kind of doesn&#39;t make sense but
it does because the story actually really wraps up a lot of stuff in it. </p>
<p>And this story
relates to a conversation that took place in 1791, so it&#39;s after the Revolution.
The United States has only been in existence for a few years when this story
takes place. And Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, who is almost newly
arrived as Secretary of State, not there for that long, decides he&#39;s going to
have a little dinner party to discuss a political question that&#39;s come up, and
he invites Vice President John Adams and he invites Secretary of the Treasury
Alexander Hamilton. The reason why we know this story is because Jefferson told
it a lot, right? Because as we&#39;ll see, Jefferson draws great, deep
significance to this little dinner conversation and he repeated it over and
over again in letters and in journals. It&#39;s like the story that reveals the
meaning of everything--but you&#39;ll see why. It won&#39;t sound too dramatic now that
I&#39;ve set it up that way, but to Jefferson it was earth-shaking. </p>
<p>So a little dinner
party, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton--and Jefferson, who tells the story, says
that after they&#39;re done with their meal, quote, &quot;our questions agreed and
dismissed, conversation began on other matters. . . . The room, being hung
around with a collection of the portraits of remarkable men--among them were those
of Bacon, Newton, and Locke--Hamilton asked me who they were.&quot; So this is
Jefferson&#39;s home and in his home are these portraits, Bacon, Newton, and Locke,
and Hamilton, sitting there as a dinner guest, looks up, sees the portrait and
says, &#39;Who are they?&#39; Okay. Jefferson says, &quot;I told him they were my
trinity of the [three] greatest men the world had ever produced&quot; (this is
Professor Jefferson in full gear) &quot;naming them.&quot; Lord Francis Bacon,
the philosopher of science, Sir Isaac Newton, the scientist who defined the
laws of gravity, John Locke, the philosopher of--I suppose you could say, the
philosopher of liberty, and as Jefferson recalled hearing this, quote, Hamilton
&quot;paused for some time. &#39;The greatest man,&#39; said he, &#39;that ever lived was
Julius Caesar.&#39;&quot; Okay. Now for reasons that will become clear in this
lecture, this shocked Jefferson, shocked Jefferson, so that he told the story
again and again and again, remembered it for decades. In the 1820s, he&#39;s still
like, &#39;I remember that story, the dinner with Hamilton 30 years ago [laughs] in
which he said, &#39;The greatest man who ever lived was Julius Caesar.&#39; He
repeated it. </p>
<p>To him it was a sign
of the amazing dangerous implications of Hamilton&#39;s policies, but I want to
pull this story apart. I want to look at this a little bit as a way not really
of getting at Jefferson and Hamilton, but to get at something of the
intellectual mindset of Americans during this period and some of this has to do
with Enlightenment thinking, and some of this has to do with constitutional
thinking, but you&#39;ll see why both men said what they said. </p>
<p>Now to start with,
I&#39;m not saying that every single colonist is sitting around at this point
discussing Bacon, Newton and Locke. Okay. That&#39;s not what I mean. This is very
much a Jeffersonian parlor with these portraits up on the wall, but those three
men--Bacon, Newton, Locke--and others, did contribute to an intellectual
atmosphere that the American colonists tapped into that shaped their thoughts
about rights, about resistance, and then eventually about revolution. </p>
<p>So let&#39;s start by
looking at Jefferson&#39;s trinity of great men. Who were they? Okay. Sir Francis
Bacon, man of science who believed that truth discovered by reason through
observation could promote human happiness as well as truth communicated through
God&#39;s direct revelation. So basically Bacon&#39;s work suggested that it was in
humankind&#39;s power to discover truth by reason and that by doing that, humankind
could better itself. Okay. So that&#39;s Bacon. </p>
<p>Isaac Newton, a
second man of science who studied gravity and the laws of motion, and Newton&#39;s
work demonstrated that it was possible through reason and study to discover the
laws of nature and of nature&#39;s God. So Newton&#39;s work suggested that the world
is governed by laws that you could discover and understand; that there&#39;s a
cause and effect, and that through reason and study you can figure out the
cause and effect of nature&#39;s laws. </p>
<p>So then on to the
third man, John Locke, whose <i>Second Treatise on Government</i> from 1683
[correction: 1689] suggested that you could apply nature&#39;s laws to the
political world as well, and determine and understand natural and political
rights. And I&#39;m going to offer here a really woefully brief summary of Locke&#39;s
thoughts that&#39;ll just be enough to give us a sense of what it is that
Jefferson&#39;s getting at here. Basically, Locke believed that people were born
free, unhampered by government and with certain natural rights--life, liberty,
and property--and that to protect these rights people decided to voluntarily
leave this state of nature to form a civil government, contracting some of
their natural rights to this government when they did so. So civil society was
created to protect humankind&#39;s three natural rights--life, liberty, property.
So you could refer to this as social contract theory, a logical enough summing up
of it. If you think about it, if a civil government is a kind of voluntary
contract, this suggests that people have a right to pull out of that contract
if their rights are being violated, and obviously that will have an important
logic down the road. </p>
<p>Now if you take all
of that together--Bacon, Newton, Locke, and the logic of their thoughts--you
can see the empowering aspect of Jefferson&#39;s trinity. Right? All of those men in
one way or another are preaching ideas that are empowering humankind. They&#39;re
suggesting that there are laws of the universe that could be determined by
people and applied to nature, to government, to science, to society in the hope
of bettering things. They suggested that civil government is a contract created
by and maintained by people, not some kind of a divine creation. And if you
step back and consider the implications of these really broad ideas, you can
see that they share an underlying conviction that humankind could solve God&#39;s
riddles by dissolving--dissolving? dissolving his laws, chaos--discovering and
applying his natural laws. </p>
<p>And in a sense this
is the idea that&#39;s the spirit of the Enlightenment--that the world is governed
by natural laws that can be detected, they can be studied, they can be applied,
and in a sense the practice of deism stems from this idea. There were some Founder
types who were basically deists at heart, believing that God was a sort of
divine clockmaker who made a world of logic and natural laws and then stepped
back and allowed it to operate without intervening, and this kind of God was
omniscient and all powerful but it was natural forces that governed daily
existence. And things that were governed by understandable and predictable
natural laws could be detected, analyzed, critiqued and applied by man. So in
this sense you really can see how some of the spirit of the Enlightenment would
have been a kind of empowering philosophy. </p>
<p>So Jefferson&#39;s
trinity of portraits reveals a lot about this kind of general Enlightenment
spirit and some of its intellectual implications, but what about the other half
of the story? What about Hamilton&#39;s comment about Julius Caesar and
Jefferson&#39;s I&#39;m-going-to-be-shocked-for-three-decades response? Well, this
aspect of the story reveals another related aspect of the Enlightenment
mentality. It shows how immediate and relevant the ancient world--and actually
history generally--was to Enlightenment thinkers, and I suppose, just in the
eighteenth century generally. An idea that&#39;s--again--related to this idea that
humankind can detect patterns and then apply them for all time. Because
basically, if you think about it, if you believe in ongoing natural patterns,
you&#39;re also going to believe that the study of history, all of history, is one
way to determine laws and patterns of human nature that apply across all time. </p>
<p>So basically to
people at this period, all of history was like a big grab bag of lessons about
humankind and civil society: ancient Greece, ancient Rome, modern nations,
modern peoples and more. If you study them, if you look at rules and patterns,
you could find things to apply to modern times that ideally would allow you to
better things for the present by learning from the past. And in a way the
ultimate example of this--I think I&#39;ve mentioned it once before in here; I&#39;m
not sure--is James Madison preparing for the Constitutional Convention and he&#39;s
very much--he&#39;s right in line with this kind of thinking. He basically says, &#39;I&#39;m
going to study republics across all time,&#39; right? All of human time--I will
study republican government--and thinking, if he could figure out the rules, if
he could figure out what works and what doesn&#39;t work and see the patterns and
get the rules, he can then apply that knowledge to the creation of a new
republic that hopefully then would benefit from that kind of knowledge. I love
the fact that Madison sets out to do that, writes it all down on paper. </p>
<p>So you can see how in
this sense--If you&#39;re thinking along these lines, you can see how ancient
history could be really immediate to this sort of whole founding generation,
because it had real lessons for the present. And actually one of the most
influential books in educating young gentlemen at the time was <i>Plutarch&#39;s
Lives. </i>Has anyone here read <i>Plutarch? </i>There must be some--Oh,
there&#39;s a couple of <i>Plutarch </i>readers in here. That&#39;s admirable. <i>Plutarch&#39;s
Lives </i>is basically a collection of brief biographies of great statesmen and
leaders, ancient Greece, ancient Rome, and it was aimed at teaching rules of
leadership, teaching young men how to model themselves into great leaders, or
certainly that&#39;s how it was used in the eighteenth century. Any young man would
have read <i>Plutarch&#39;s Lives </i>and would have learned--the greatest thing I
can do is to be a great statesman and found a nation, and here are great
examples for me to follow. </p>
<p>So given this kind of
a logic, there&#39;s a good reason why Hamilton&#39;s comment about Caesar might have
been shocking to Jefferson. It&#39;s not just a little interesting intellectual
sort of &quot;ha&quot; on the part of Hamilton: &#39;oh, I think the greatest man
that ever lived was Julius Caesar, pass the cherries.&#39; It&#39;s not--He didn&#39;t see
this as a sort of random idle throwaway intellectual comment. It was a
declaration about present day policies to Jefferson, and it wasn&#39;t a
declaration that made Jefferson happy because think about the historical lesson
that Jefferson logically pulled from Hamilton&#39;s comment about Julius Caesar.
Who was Julius Caesar? In short, he was the man who destroyed the Roman
republic. Okay. He&#39;s the guy who marched his army against the republic, who
seized power, who made himself emperor. So there we are in 1791 and Alexander
Hamilton in the middle of this experiment to create a new republic--no one
knows if it&#39;s going to work; it might collapse at any second--and Alexander
Hamilton says, &#39;The greatest man who ever lived is Julius Caesar,&#39; the man who
destroyed the Roman republic. </p>
<p>Okay. This is why
Jefferson was like [laughs]: &#39;oh, my God. What does this mean?&#39; What does this
mean? This is the truth to Hamilton. Right? This is a bad moment as far as
relations between Jefferson and Hamilton are concerned, the Jefferson dinner
party. Hamilton never lived it down. So to Jefferson this is--to him this was
like he--the scales were lifted from his eyes. Right? Hamilton wants to be a
kind of Caesar. He&#39;s dangerously ambitious. He wants to destroy the republic.
Maybe he wants to make it back into a monarchy and then put himself into some
kind of a position of power. He could just see the pathway laid, all with that
one little comment that Hamilton tossed out at a dinner. You had to be careful
how you talked [laughs] in an age where history meant that much. </p>
<p>Now let&#39;s stop for a
moment also to think: why did Hamilton say that? Why did he say that? It&#39;s
unlikely that what he meant to say was, &#39;Hi. I&#39;m going to be the next Julius
Caesar. [laughs] I&#39;m out to destroy the republic. Nice to meet you.&#39; Okay.
He probably wasn&#39;t intending to signal some big threat to the American
republic. </p>
<p>I think that there
are probably two explanations for it. No one actually ever absolutely knows why
he said this and that says more about Hamilton than anything else. He&#39;s a
wonderfully self-destructive individual, Alexander Hamilton, but in this case I
think there are two possible reasons why he said this. One is he actually just
liked to say things to upset Thomas Jefferson. [laughter] He really did and
this was a good one, [laughs] better than he thought, but he liked to push
Jefferson&#39;s buttons, get Jefferson all sort of sputtering and mad, and it
worked. Aaron Burr did the same thing to Alexander Hamilton. He would say sort
of shocking, outrageous things and then watch Hamilton sputter, and then
Hamilton would repeat them for years and years and years. &#39;Do you know what he
said at the dinner party?&#39; Dinner parties were tricky places to maneuver in
the early republic. </p>
<p>So part of it might
have been just Hamilton being deliberately irritating, or equally possible,
it&#39;s possible that Hamilton was referring to Caesar as a statesman, a leader, a
founder of a nation. Hamilton would have admired military ability, so he would
have actually seriously admired that in Caesar too, but he really could have
been more thinking of Caesar as great statesman, great leader, depicted in <i>Plutarch
</i>as a model. And certainly in the mind of an educated gentleman like
Hamilton, being the founder of a nation, being someone who&#39;s shaping a nation,
would have been seen as an admirable thing, so he could have been thinking
along those lines. It&#39;s interesting when you look through all of Hamilton&#39;s
writings--he doesn&#39;t really speak in praise of Caesar anywhere else, which
might lead you to theory number one. [laughter] &#39;Okay, T.J., see how you deal
with this one. [laughs] I&#39;m all for Julius Caesar. [laughs] What are you
going to do?&#39; No. </p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to know,
but at any rate it&#39;s unclear what Hamilton&#39;s logic is, but you can certainly
understand Jefferson&#39;s shocked response, and either way, both the comment and
the response reveal the power of the classical heritage on this early American
world. Both men are applying the past to the present in some way. And one of
the lessons that Caesar certainly suggested to Thomas Jefferson as suggested by
his response is a powerful lesson that a lot of people were focused on in the
early years of the American republic and in this colonial period as well, and
that is the fragility of liberties--and in the republic also obviously how
fragile republics are. So the ancient world held really valuable lessons but so
did the semi-recent past as well, particularly for the American colonists. </p>
<p>There was another
period of time that seemed to hold special lessons for them, the period of the
Glorious Revolution in Britain, which would have been a period when opposition
to the King&#39;s Court and ministers was on the rise in Britain along with a
growing tradition of praise for English liberties and the glories of
representation in Parliament. So political rhetoric from the era of the
Glorious Revolution would have focused on attacking corruption and corrupt
influence, as when a monarch would try to bribe legislators or ministers with
high office or pensions granted from the Crown, thereby subverting the balanced
British constitution, which is supposed to be balanced between Crown, Lords and
Commons. That would have had some real bearing on this revolutionary period as
well But whether talking about history ancient or history relatively modern,
history did teach some overriding lessons that British subjects would have
taken as their own throughout this period and that at this moment in time would
seem really relevant in the American colonies. </p>
<p>So--there is going to
be an amazingly brief summary of some of these lessons, but you&#39;ll see really
clear lessons that history would appear to be teaching generally and that the
colonists would be listening to really attentively. So history taught basically
that arbitrary power is the ultimate threat to good government. Okay. So the
1770s is a moment when that&#39;s certainly going to be something that people hear.
History taught that political liberties were fragile. History taught that
constitutional principles defended customary contractarian rights against
government assertions of arbitrary power. So arbitrary power is the ultimate
threat to good government; political liberties are fragile; and it&#39;s
constitutional principles that defend against government asserting arbitrary
power. So yes, Rome had been great, but arbitrary power had sent it spiraling
into tyranny. The Glorious Revolution had been a moment where ancient liberties
had been restored by restraining the power of the monarch. So clearly history
taught liberty is fragile, and power is the natural enemy--arbitrary power--and
power naturally grows, by nature power grows, and as it does it encroaches on
liberties in a free society. </p>
<p>So power has to be
restrained; British liberties must be defended; and British liberties, as
defined by generations of constitutional precedents. Now it&#39;s important to
remember that the British constitution is not a written document like American
state and federal constitutions. It&#39;s a way of thinking about authority largely
based on precedent, based on existing institutions, based on laws and customs,
and it was a means of limiting power and defending rights. </p>
<p>So when British
colonial policy began to change in the mid-eighteenth century and precedents
seemed to be abandoned and new precedents perhaps were being set, when Parliament
seemed to be asserting what certainly to some colonists felt like arbitrary
power, colonists logically began to worry about protecting their fundamental
British liberties against seemingly increasingly arbitrary parliamentary power.
They felt defensive. They worried about the seeming inevitability of a rise of
arbitrary power. </p>
<p>Now of course people
in Parliament did not see themselves as exercising arbitrary power. They saw
themselves as behaving constitutionally, asserting their constitutional power
to govern over the colonies, but as we&#39;ve seen in this course so far, there
were some fundamental disagreements on both sides about the precise meaning of Parliament&#39;s
constitutional power to govern over the colonies, about the precise way in
which this imperial system was supposed to work. So acts like the Stamp Act,
which Parliament basically intended as a way to raise revenue, or the Tea Act,
same idea, could logically seem to the colonists like a way of establishing a
new precedent, right?--a new precedent that ultimately would be making some
kind of inroad against liberty and property rights. And particularly, given
that the Stamp Act was not ultimately raising enormous sums of money to the
colonists, that was a real sign that it must be about a precedent. Right? It
can&#39;t really be about raising enormous sums of money. It must be a trap, a
precedent-setting trap, that if they can get us to accept this precedent then
the government will be able to set future taxes along similar lines because the
precedent will have been set. If your constitution--If you understand your
constitutional rights as based on precedent, when you see new precedents
potentially being set that&#39;s a potentially scary thing, so you can kind of get
a sense of why the colonists are reacting as they do to a lot of events in this
period. </p>
<p>As John Dickinson
wrote in--I&#39;ve mentioned before his really well-known pamphlet from 1768 called
<i>Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania. </i>Dickinson wrote, &quot;Nothing is
wanted at home&quot;--and by home he means Britain--&quot;but a precedent, the
force of which shall be established by the tacit submission of the colonies. .
. . If the parliament succeeds in this attempt, other statutes will impose
other duties. [A]nd thus the parliament will levy upon us such sums of money
as they chuoose to take, without any other limitation, than their
pleasure.&quot; Right? He says it&#39;s just about the precedent; it&#39;s all about
precedent. That&#39;s what we&#39;re looking at here. The fact that small amounts of
money are being raised in a sense is the ultimate proof that what really
matters to Parliament is the precedent that they&#39;re setting. </p>
<p>The same holds true
for the Vice-Admiralty courts I&#39;ve mentioned before, that were being used as
venues for trying certain crimes committed in the colonies. Vice-Admiralty
courts were composed of a single judge, they had no jury, and they were
becoming responsible for enforcing parliamentary legislation and new
legislation. Logically, many colonists would have seen this--again--really
dangerous precedent violating fundamental British constitutional rights,
violating past precedents. </p>
<p>The presence of a
standing army in the colonies: also, same kind of threat, same kind of fear,
something new is happening here, and certainly history ancient and modern
taught about the dangers of a standing army. And Samuel Adams summed up
prevailing ideas about standing armies in a newspaper essay that he wrote in
1768 and he wrote, </p>
<p>&quot;It is a very
improbable supposition, that any people can long remain free, with a strong
military power in the very heart of their country: Unless that military power
is under the direction of the people, and even then it is dangerous.-- History,
both ancient and modern, affords many instances of the overthrow of states and
kingdoms by the power of soldiers, who were rais&#39;d and maintain&#39;d at first
under the plausible pretense of defending those very liberties which they
afterwards destroyed.&quot; </p>
<p>So in the colonies
the fear of a standing army was bad enough at the end of the French and Indian
War when the crown sent troops to protect the colonists against the French, the
Spanish and the Native American populations--but a few years later when troops
began to arrive in Boston in response to Stamp Act demonstrations, it certainly
seemed to many colonists as though it might be the first step in what could be
the destruction of their liberties, their colonial charters, their
constitutional rights. This seemed to be--again--a scary precedent. </p>
<p>Now in a way it&#39;s
really tempting to look at this way of thinking like, these people are worried
about precedents--&#39;What&#39;s happening? What does it mean? It must be a sign
that they&#39;re going to do worse&#39;--and think of these people as being really
paranoid and illogical like, &#39;oh, come on. [laughs] What if it&#39;s just a little
gesture to raise some money, colonists? Why do you seem so paranoid?&#39; And
there--In the past there actually have been some historians who suggested that
the colonists were to some degree being paranoid, were seeing threats of
tyranny where there actually wasn&#39;t any tyranny at all. But as I&#39;ve just
described, precedents are a fundamental part of British constitutional thought.
And Enlightenment theory backed up that idea, because Enlightenment science
promised the capacity to understand and control nature and society. You&#39;re
supposed to be looking for patterns of behavior to understand what things mean.
</p>
<p>So the British
government seemed to be setting new precedents and the colonists were looking
for the pattern, trying to figure out the logic of what was happening. What was
Parliament up to? What were they thinking? Why were they seemingly violating
fundamental constitutional rights? And you can see this logic again in
Dickinson&#39;s pamphlet, in his <i>Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, </i>which
he argued was premised on his desire, quote, &quot;to discover the intentions
of those who rule over us.&quot; Why are they doing what they&#39;re doing?
There&#39;s a pattern. What is the pattern? What does it mean? </p>
<p>Colonists ultimately
resisted what they saw as the approach of tyranny, and their resistance
stiffened the British government&#39;s resolve, which in turn provoked more of a
reaction in the colonies. And eventually down the road, the colonists would
come to see their social contract with the British government broken, a
conclusion which would seem to then give them the right of community
resistance, but as I&#39;ve said before it&#39;s important to recognize that the
colonists at this point see their actions not as revolutionary but just the
opposite. They&#39;re fighting for their British rights. They&#39;re not trying to
figure out how to stage a revolution. I think when we hear the phrase
&quot;Continental Congress,&quot; we&#39;re like: &#39;ooh, one more Continental
Congress and we&#39;re there, [laughs] wow, almost at independence,&#39;--but that&#39;s
obviously not the way that they&#39;re thinking at the time. They see themselves as
fighting against arbitrary power in defense of British liberties, not as rabid
revolutionaries, and thus far in the course, it&#39;s Parliament that seems to be
the main source of arbitrary power to the colonists. </p>
<p>So as we&#39;re going to
see in future lectures, a logical response to this conclusion would be for the
colonists to next turn to the King to solve their problems. Okay. If Parliament
is exercising arbitrary power we will now turn to the King and appeal to him to
solve our problems. You--We will see that logic go into effect very soon in
future lectures. So more has to happen before the colonists begin to consider
the ultimate act of resistance. Actual rebellion would seem to them as the last
resort, the last resort of a people unable to protect their lives, liberties
and properties by normal constitutional methods, and there were some Members of
Parliament that could foresee this looming threat. </p>
<p>In early 1775, Edmund
Burke gave one of his best known speeches in Parliament. It was a three-hour
speech and he argued in his speech that Parliament should try to be
conciliatory towards the colonies or risk pushing them to extremes. And he laid
out in this speech some of the points that actually have come up just in the
course of this lecture. He said Americans loved their liberties. Why? Because
they&#39;re descendants of liberty-loving English citizens. To those who argued
that giving concessions to the colonists would encourage them to demand even
more concessions, Burke said, he doubted whether, quote, &quot;giving. . . two
millions of my fellow citizens, some share of those rights, which I have always
been taught to value,&quot; would bring down the empire. And he had a dramatic
conclusion. He said, &quot;Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil
rights associated with your government;-- they will cling and grapple to you;
and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance But
let it once be understood that your government may be one thing, and their
privilege another; that these two things may exist without any mutual relation;
the cement is gone; the cohesion is loosened; and everything hastens to decay
and dissolution.&quot; </p>
<p>So to the colonists
then in a sense--you can hear, to Burke as well--rebellion would be a drastic
action only to be exercised by an overwhelming majority of the community
against rulers who so completely ignored the terms of the original social
contract as to make further allegiance a crime against God and reason. And it&#39;s
really only by grasping this mindset and really taking it seriously that we can
begin to understand events to come that ultimately will lead to what is seen at
the time as that last dire step towards revolution. I will stop there. I will
see you on Tuesday. Happy paper-completing and have a good weekend. </p>
