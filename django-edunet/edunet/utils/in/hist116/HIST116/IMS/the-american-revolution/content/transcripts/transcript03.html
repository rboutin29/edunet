<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>Okay.
So Thursday, last--long ago, last week, we began to set the scene for this
course by talking about the experience of being a British colonist, and as you
remember we talked about the connection the colonists had with England both
positive and negative; we talked about their sense of England--and particularly
London--as being the sort of the center of the empire and almost the center of
the universe; and we talked about the colonists&#39; simultaneous concerns about
maybe not quite being as good as the people who were at that wonderful
sophisticated center of the universe. And I closed the lecture by noting that
in many ways the colonists were never as British as when they began to object
and then ultimately rebel against their mother country for not being given
their full rights as British subjects. </p>
<p>Okay. So if
Thursday&#39;s lecture was about how the colonists identified with the mother
country, today&#39;s lecture sort of does the opposite. And what I&#39;m going to be
talking about today is the ways in which the colonists and the colonies were
different from people back in the mother country. Basically, as the title of
this lecture suggests, I&#39;m going to be talking about being a British American
as opposed to being a British colonist, which was last week. Now connected with
what I suggested on Thursday, it&#39;s important to note that the American
colonists weren&#39;t necessarily aware of the ways in which some of their ideas
and attitudes were different, or certainly were evolving differently from those
in England, and I&#39;ll come back to this again in this lecture but I&#39;ll mention
it here. By the mid-eighteenth century, the period that we&#39;re really talking
about now, there had already been several generations of colonists in the
colonies. So certainly there were people in the colonies who themselves had
never been to England, perhaps they didn&#39;t know very many people who had been
to England, and so they didn&#39;t necessarily have an amazingly accurate sense of
really what it meant to be a British subject in England, living in England
proper, as opposed to their experience of being in the colonies. And that&#39;s
going to be an important thing to think about as we continue on in this course,
this idea that ideas are evolving differently in the colonies than they&#39;re
evolving in England, and the colonists didn&#39;t necessarily realize that these
differences existed. Okay. </p>
<p>So I want to begin
this lecture on being a British American with just a handful of examples and -- really,
kinds of snapshots of life in the colonies in the 1740s. And as you&#39;ll see with
these little examples, they&#39;re going to each be demonstrating something that
I&#39;m going to come back to later in the lecture, but I at least wanted to give
you sort of a sense of what it looked like before I actually talked about it.
And I&#39;ve pulled all of these examples--there&#39;s three or four of them--all from
the same source, which is from a really well-known diary by a Dr. Alexander
Hamilton. And this is not the Alexander Hamilton. I always feel bad for this
guy because [laughter] he&#39;s gone down to posterity as not the real Alexander
Hamilton. [laughter] He&#39;s the not real--he&#39;s the unknown, unimportant
Alexander Hamilton, poor guy--who lived in Maryland as a doctor, and actually
he does have a really interesting diary. I&#39;ll be reading a couple of sections
from it, but he&#39;s not the founder, tough break for Alexander Hamilton. Okay. </p>
<p>So in 1744, he
decided to take a trip north from Maryland for his health, and that&#39;s when he
keeps this sort of a travel diary, and in it he recorded his observations with
a lot of detail, as you&#39;ll hear, that show a lot about habits of behavior and
thought in the colonies or certain--and they also will show a lot, as you&#39;ll
see, about Mr. Hamilton, but also they sort of show you what he saw through the
lens of him--but still they&#39;ll give you a sense of some trends. Okay. And I&#39;ll--Actually,
I&#39;ll add here one little brief point, and that is I&#39;m--in a sense this is
touching on something that I&#39;m going to be focusing on in Thursday&#39;s lecture--and
that&#39;s the idea that to many people--and you&#39;ll hear it sort of underlying what
he&#39;s saying here--to many people, their individual colony really was what felt
to them like their country, and people often referred to--Jefferson called
Virginia &quot;my country&quot; well into the 1790s, if not beyond. So you&#39;ll
be hearing how people really feel about their colony versus those other foreign
colonies, that people often felt as though they were different countries with
strange habits and weird speech patterns, so you&#39;ll kind of hear that, beneath
what I&#39;m going to read here by Hamilton. </p>
<p>Okay. So one thing
that Hamilton wrote about in his diary shows the impact of the Great Awakening.
During the time that he was traveling, which is the 1740s, the colonies were
actually right in the middle of the Great Awakening, which was this really vast
religious revival that really swept through the colonies, and in the course of
Hamilton&#39;s travels he said he could always tell when he came across a
revivalist because they always had a really dour expression on their face as
though they were just about to ask you to repent for your sins. </p>
<p>So he says at one
point he came across one of these revivalists. He said the fellow was named Mr.
Thomas Quiet and, as Hamilton put it in his diary: &quot;This fellow I
observed had a particular down-hanging look, which made me suspect&quot; that
he is one of the revivalists. &quot;I guessed right, for he introduced a
discourse&quot; concerning George Whitefield, who is the renowned preacher of
the Great Awakening. He traveled throughout the colonies preaching, and in a
lot of ways he was sort of the guiding force behind this Great Awakening in
America. So Mr. Thomas Quiet &quot;enlarged pretty much and with some warmth
upon the doctrines of that apostle, speaking much in his praise. I took upon me,
in a ludicrous manner, to impugn some of his doctrines.&quot; Charming: he was
like &#39;oh, well, since this means a lot to him, I&#39;ll just make fun of it.&#39;
&quot;Which by degrees put Mr. Quiet in a passion.&quot; So--and he
successfully upsets Mr. Quiet. &quot;He told me flatly that I was damned
without redemption.&quot; [laughter] A really fun conversation. &quot;I replied
that I thought his name and behavior were very incongruous, and desired him to
change it with all speed, [laughter] for it was very improper that such an
angry turbulent mortal as he should be called by the name of Thomas Quiet.&quot;
Okay. This tells you a lot about Alexander [laughter] Hamilton. It just--As
you&#39;ll hear, he doesn&#39;t sound like a really charming fellow, but certainly that
passage gives you a sense of the sort of religiosity that marked this
particular period. </p>
<p>Okay. So sometime
later, Hamilton met three men from Pennsylvania and he decided he was going to
treat them to punch in an off-roads tavern. Now to Hamilton, as you&#39;ll hear,
clearly these three men were not gentlemen or certainly he assumed that they
were beneath him. As he noted in his diary: One of them seemed to have to
think really, really hard about every word that came out of his mouth. One of
them was &quot;profuse in compliments, which were generally blunt, and came out
in an awkward manner,&quot; and the third one was a </p>
<p>&quot;very roughspun,
forward, clownish blade, much addicted to swearing, at the same time desirous
to pass for a gentleman, notwithstanding which ambition, the conscientiousness
of his natural boorishness obliged him frequently to frame ill-timed apologies
for his misbehaviour, which he termed frankness and freeness. It was often,&quot;
quote, &quot;Damn me, gentlemen, excuse me; I am a plain, honest fellow; all is
right down plain-dealing, by God.&quot; </p>
<p>So he manages to
apologize and swear in the same sentence, which is pretty tricky. Now that
fellow --that Hamilton refers to as the sort of odd cursing fellow--went on to
curse Sir Robert Walpole, who was a recent British Prime Minister, as a rascal,
and as Hamilton put it: &quot;We asked him his reasons for cursing Sir R[obert]
but he would give us no other&quot; than this, &quot;that he was certainly
informed by some very good gentlemen who understood the thing right well, that
the said Sir R[obert] was a damn rogue,&quot; so he must be. [laughs] &#39;Well,
important gentlemen have told me he was and thus he must be, and I will now
quote it to anyone I meet in random taverns by the side of the road.&#39; </p>
<p>So here you see three
average people trying clearly, or at least to Hamilton, trying clearly to
impress or please him in some way. Clearly, he is sort of snarkily feeling as
though he&#39;s above them in social status. His tavern companions feel a little
bit awkward. They&#39;re apologizing all the time and saying, &#39;Well, I&#39;m just a
plain speaker,&#39; all of which Hamilton clearly finds amusing. And this anecdote
suggests two things. First it shows people of different social ranks obviously
socializing, and shows several, well, what Hamilton would have considered
common folk trying to, in his mind, pass for gentlemen. But second, you see a
group of people who all perceive differences in status on all sides. So they&#39;re
hanging out together, but they also understand that there&#39;s a little bit of a
difference that&#39;s making them feel somewhat awkward. </p>
<p>Okay. So at another
tavern--So Hamilton&#39;s going tavern to tavern I guess in this portion of the
trip. At another tavern he said he dined &quot;with a very mixed company of
different nations and religions. There were Scots, English, Dutch, Germans,&quot;
Irish, &quot;Roman Catholicks, Churchmen, Presbyterians, Quakers, Newlightmen,
Methodists, Seventhdaymen, Moravians, Anabaptists, and one Jew.&quot; [laughter]
I like the fact that he counted that one guy. So obviously here you see
diversity, great diversity of all kinds--religious diversity, ethnic diversity--which
also represents something that was typical of the colonies in a general way,
though more in some places than in others. And actually Pennsylvania, which is
where I think he is at this point, was known at the time for being particularly
diverse. </p>
<p>One last anecdote.
So at one point he--Hamilton says he ended up in a conversation with some
Pennsylvanians about how low Maryland was in comparison with Pennsylvania,
which clearly was a much better colony. As Hamilton put it, the Pennsylvanians &quot;enlarged
upon the immorality, drunkenness, rudeness, and immoderate swearing, so much
practiced in Maryland, and added that no such vices were to be found in
Pennsylvania. I heard this and contradicted it not, because I knew that the
first part of the proposition was pretty true.&quot; He&#39;s like, [laughs] &#39;yeah,
we are drunk and we do swear a lot and we&#39;re rude in Maryland so, okay. I think
that&#39;s true.&#39; [laughter] &quot;But what appeared most comical in their criticism
was their making a merit of the stoniness of the roads.&quot; As one put it: &quot;&#39;One
may ride . . . fifty miles in Maryland and not see as many stones upon the
roads as [in] fifty paces of roads in Pennsylvania.&#39; This I knew to be false,
but as I thought there was no advantage in stony roads, I . . . let them take
the honour of it to themselves, and did not contradict them.&quot; </p>
<p>Now to me, one of the
interesting things about this anecdote: It makes me think about almost a
century later when we&#39;re talking about de Tocqueville, and he&#39;s wandering
around America talking with random Americans, and one of the things that drives
him a little bit nuts is that no matter what American he talks to, no matter
where he is, the American always tells him how everything is best in America,
better than anywhere else in the world. So what Tocqueville is witnessing in
the middle of the--towards the middle of the nineteenth century is national
pride, and what you&#39;re seeing here is a close equivalent, but obviously it&#39;s colonial
pride. It&#39;s pride in your own individual colony. And in a sense, again, it&#39;s a
reminder that people are seeing their colony as their country. </p>
<p>So in all of these
little--these snapshots, these anecdotes--we&#39;ve seen a few things about life in
the colonies. We&#39;ve seen religiosity and the impact of the Great Awakening;
we&#39;ve seen diversity of all types, sometimes at one dinner table; we&#39;ve seen a
middling society; and we&#39;ve seen how people saw their own colony as their own
country and in a sense other colonies as other countries. To varying degrees in
all of the colonies, all of these things were characteristic. </p>
<p>So with that
introduction, I want to turn now to really look at what was different about the
American colonies. Why were people here different? Why was life here different
from what it would have been like to be a British subject back in England? So
that&#39;s going to be what I mainly address for the rest of the lecture, and I&#39;m
going to talk about it by focusing on three different points. Point number one:
I&#39;m going to talk a little bit about the distinctive character of the people
who migrated to the colonies. It gives you such a sense of power when you&#39;re
lecturing and you say, &quot;There are three reasons&quot; and the entire room
goes: &quot;Oh.&quot; [laughter] &quot;Three. There are three.&quot; So there
are three. So number one is the distinctive character of the people who
migrated to the colonies. Number two is the distinctive conditions of life in
British America,--and that point I&#39;ll talk about for the longest. And then
number three is the nature of British colonial administration. And I&#39;ll repeat
that: the distinctive character of the people who migrated to the colonies, the
distinctive conditions of life in British North America, and the nature of
British colonial administration. </p>
<p>So let&#39;s start off
first by looking at that first category of difference, the character of the
people who migrated to the colonies--and, as you&#39;ll see, in some ways a distinctive
kind of person migrated to the colonies--or at least tended to--in ways that
will make perfect sense. So for one thing--and in a way this sounds obvious
once you think about it--people who migrated to the colonies tended to be risk-takers.
These were people who were willing to take a risk. They were willing to make
the hazardous passage across the sea, put themselves at a distance of several
months&#39; travel from everything that they knew, and start life anew in what they
assumed to be some kind of a wilderness. They were people who wanted something,
maybe to better their condition, and they weren&#39;t afraid to act on that desire,
to reach for it. Obviously, these are people who are going to be pretty
independent and they were often people who didn&#39;t simply accept the status quo.
Now all of these are really big, broad generalizations, but as big and broad as
they are, you can see in a general sense that people who are deciding to
migrate in this way -- certainly, many of them would have shared some of these
characteristics to some degree. </p>
<p>And, as we&#39;re going
to see in the next few weeks, in a general way this spirit ran through all of
the colonies, this sort of sense of really being willing to push for what you
wanted. In the Old World, naturally enough, things were more tradition-bound.
In the New World, just by deciding to go to the colonies, you were already
breaking with tradition and behaving differently from the average British
subject. So if you put this different sort of person in a different kind of
environment, as in the colonies, you begin to understand the slow creation of
something that ends up being a kind of colonial American mindset or mentality. </p>
<p>And this brings us to
my second category of differences in the colonies, which is: the conditions of
life in British North America. You have a different kind of person. Now you&#39;re
putting them in a different kind of living situation--and there were a number
of things that were different about living conditions in the colonies. First,
as I mentioned last time, more people owned land in the colonies. There was a
lot of land, &quot;empty land,&quot; some of it actually empty land, some of it
land owned by Indians that people considered to be &quot;empty,&quot; but there
was more land that was certainly accessible to settlers in the colonies. So
these risk-taking types who came to the colonies could get land and set up
their own farms a lot more easily than they could in England, which gave more
people a more independent lifestyle in the colonies, and a sense meant they
could be and maybe were raising themselves up in the world in a way that might
not have been as easy to do back in England. </p>
<p>A second difference
in living conditions involved voting and political participation, because
logically enough and generally speaking, landholding and the vote went hand in
hand, the idea being in the colonies that you should only let people vote who
were really invested in a community, and landholders are pretty literally
invested in their communities. So in the colonies where you have a lot--a much
larger number of landholders, you have a much wider franchise than in England.
So an example of that: In the 1760s in England, roughly twenty percent of
white men had the vote. In the colonies, roughly sixty to eighty percent of
white men had the vote depending on the colony, which is a pretty big
difference. </p>
<p>And that one fact
alone represents a big shift in mindset. In the colonies you had lots of
landholders who knew that they had the right to be directly involved in the
political process. Equally important, not only were more people able to be
active in the political process, but the process in which they were taking part
was really localized, so people felt able to understand and effect that
process. A lot of times you knew--or at least perhaps had met--many of the
people that held government offices--and elections could be won or lost by just
a handful of votes. Now when I first taught this course, that always used to be
an amazing fact, &#39;well, an election could be lost by a handful of votes,&#39; and
somehow in the last ten years that doesn&#39;t seem amazing anymore. [laughs] We
do that all the time now. I don&#39;t know why that happens. </p>
<p>Okay. So I want to
look for just a couple of minutes at how voting actually worked in the
colonies, and it varies from colony to colony, so again I&#39;m talking in a
general kind of a way here. Elections first of all --and this is generally true
in all of the colonies--they had to take place over the course of a few days,
because people were often traveling from very far away to get to a polling
place. And once they got there, because it was such a big deal for people to
get to a polling place, they generally discovered what in essence was a kind of
a fair. Election Day was a big sort of celebration day. There were a lot of
people mulling about. There was a lot happening. There was a lot of alcohol.
The alcohol was provided by the candidates. [laughter] &#39;Here. You must vote
for me.&#39; [laughs] &#39;Have another.&#39; And the candidates themselves would have
been present, helping to pour, and mingling with prospective voters. </p>
<p>Now a couple of years
ago--I knew this fact for myself. I hadn&#39;t ever sort of thought about how it
played out, and then a couple of years ago I was researching in the Virginia
Historical Society. I was of course looking for something else, but what I came
across was a bunch of documents that clearly involved some kind of legal
dispute that broke out because of a problem on one of the election days in
Virginia. And apparently what happened was, the brother of one of the
candidates showed up with a pack of his friends, drank a lot, got really drunk
and then stood at the door of the polling place with guns and threatened to
shoot anyone who didn&#39;t vote for the brother of the guy standing there. [laughter]
&#39;Don&#39;t vote for my brother, you die.&#39; A strong persuasive component. So
obviously, at least in that election, you had drinking, celebrating, and guns,
which is a bad combination, [laughter]--but elections were really kind of rowdy
occasions. </p>
<p>Now what that kind of
hints of, that sort of &#39;door persuasion,&#39; is that actually, once you went in to
the polling place, assuming that you weren&#39;t shot first, there were no secret
ballots. You actually stepped to the front of the room, there usually was a
table, at the table were sitting the candidates and maybe some official,
perhaps a local sheriff, and you declared who you voted for in front of
everybody and in front of the candidates. </p>
<p>So one example
actually from a document from the time period: We&#39;re in Virginia and one
voter, a Mr. Blair, came forward to this table in the front of the room, a
candidate on each side of the table, the sheriff in the middle, and the sheriff
says, &quot;Sir, who do you vote for?&quot; and Mr. Blair says, &quot;Mr.
Marshall,&quot; and Mr. Marshall responds, &quot;Your vote is appreciated, Mr.
Blair.&quot; It&#39;s a very personal exchange. The next voter, a Mr. Buchanan, is
asked the same question and he says that he votes for Mr. Clapton and Mr.
Clapton responds, &quot;Mr. Buchanan, I shall treasure that vote in my memory.
It will be regarded as a feather in my cap forever.&quot; [laughter] That&#39;s
such a politician, [laughs] Isn&#39;t it? Already you can hear. So obviously this
is a very personal process in which certainly you could feel some pressure to
vote a certain way. It&#39;s actually a surprisingly long period of time before
people figure out that maybe ballots are a great idea; maybe voting in person
is not so good. Okay. So you&#39;ve got more land holding in the colonies, which leads
to a broader franchise in the colonies. You have voters taking part in a very
localized, immediate political process. </p>
<p>Another significant
difference in colonial conditions of life connects with something that I had
mentioned briefly on Thursday, and that&#39;s the nature of the colonial social
structure. As I mentioned last week, you did have an elite in the colonies, but
the proportions of elite and laboring people was different. In England, half of
the population roughly was of the laboring class, people who did not own land
and labored for others. And the other half of the population--which included
small farmers and gentry and nobility--owned most of the land. In the colonies,
two-thirds of the white men owned land or businesses--again, which gives you a
sense of why the colonies are often known as a sort of middling society. </p>
<p>Also in the colonies
there wasn&#39;t such a stark contrast between the top and the bottom of the social
spectrum. So in England, you had the royal Court and the courtiers and opulence
and court ritual and sort of kowtowing to the King at the very top of the
social spectrum. Obviously, the colonies did not have something like that. They
did have royal governors, and certainly royal governors lived in fine style in
comparison with others, and there was certainly a distinction between average
people and gentlemen, but the contrast between governors and farmers was
nowhere near the extreme contrast between a member of the entrenched British
nobility and a landless commoner. So in America the spectrum--It&#39;s like the top
and the bottom of that spectrum have been sort of lopped off and what&#39;s in
between is a little bit more pliable. </p>
<p>So more landholding,
broader franchise and everything that that entails, more of a middling society,
and now yet another colonial difference that I hinted about at the start of
today&#39;s lecture: the fact that several generations of colonists had lived and
died in the colonies having never been to England. By the mid-eighteenth
century you had a colonial society full of people who often had no actual
personal tie to England except an emotional tie, and I talked about those
emotional ties last week. So just think about this comparison. The length of
time between the first settlement at Jamestown and the Declaration of
Independence is roughly the same as the length of time between the Declaration
of Independence and World War II. Okay. We tend to collapse all of early
America into one big blob of early America, and we assume it&#39;s a kind of a
small blob, but if you think about that, Declaration of Independence to World
War II, Jamestown to the Declaration of Independence, we are talking about a
broad expanse of time. So these people, or at least many of them, are truly
British Americans at this point. </p>
<p>Colonists were also
not Britons in yet another way--another distinctive feature of colonial society--and
that&#39;s again something I referred to at the beginning, and that&#39;s the great
ethnic and religious diversity. As our friend, Mr. Hamilton, or Dr. Hamilton,
was noting, there were immigrants from Germany, Scotland, Ireland, there were
Quakers, there were Roman Catholics, Congregationalists, and then later on
Methodists and Baptists. So generally speaking, it&#39;s a reasonably pluralistic
society with a relatively high tolerance for diversity, although New Englanders
in some ways, particularly in early colonial times, are a little bit less
tolerant. </p>
<p>Related to this
diversity is yet another colonial distinction, and that&#39;s the religiosity in
the colonies, which is really heightened by the Great Awakening, which was
roughly from the 1730s to the 1760s. Now I&#39;ve said that, but what I really want
to also point out: I&#39;m not saying that the Great Awakening is a purely
colonial phenomenon, because it isn&#39;t. And as a matter of fact it spread to the
colonies from England and from Ireland, but its impact on the colonies would be
different when you combined it with some of the other things that were
distinctive about colonial society and life as I&#39;m talking about here. </p>
<p>Now we can have a
little Yale moment here. I&#39;m always looking for a Yale moment. This is a
little Yale moment, because Jonathan Edwards is someone of importance in the
spread of the Great Awakening. His preaching really sparked the New England
branch of the Great Awakening. Edwards preached that God was wrathful, that
endless torture awaited the sinner, but God was also loving and wanted sinners
to convert and turn towards God&#39;s love and, most important, you could choose
heaven or hell depending on whether you chose to repent. And I can&#39;t resist--Whenever
I get to this part of the course, I can&#39;t resist offering a little snippet of
one of Edwards&#39; most famous sermons, which is <i>Sinners in the Hands of an
Angry God</i>. How many of you have read? A good number of you have read.
That&#39;s a great sermon, 1741. I can&#39;t resist giving you your own Great Awakening
moment because that means I get to actually be Edwards for a little bit and
offer you the wrath of God, so I will offer you a tiny snippet from Edwards&#39;
sermon. I think it&#39;s different when you hear it from when you read it. </p>
<p>&quot;The God that
holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider or some loathsome
insect over the fire, abhors you and is dreadfully provoked. His wrath towards
you burns like fire. He looks upon you as worthy of nothing else but to be cast
into the fire. He is of purer eyes than to bear to have you in his sight. You
are ten thousand times more abominable in his eyes than the most hateful
venomous serpent is in ours. You have offended him infinitely more than ever a
stubborn rebel did his prince, and yet it is nothing but his hand that holds
you from falling into the fire every moment. It is to be ascribed to nothing
else that you did not go to hell the last night, that you were suffered to
awake again in this world after you closed your eyes to sleep, and there was no
other reason to be given why you have not dropped into hell since you arose
this morning and that God&#39;s--but that God&#39;s hand has held you up. There is no
other reason to be given why you have not gone to hell since you have sat here.
Oh, sinner, consider the fearful danger you are in. You hang by a slender
thread with the flames of divine wrath flashing about it, ready every moment to
singe it and burn it asunder, and you have no interest in any mediator and
nothing to lay hold of save yourself, nothing to keep off the flames of wrath,
nothing of your own, nothing that you have ever done, nothing that you can do
to induce God to spare you one moment.&quot; </p>
<p>I think--wow, that&#39;s
sermonizing. That&#39;s &quot;pow&quot; in-your-face sermonizing. So that, kind of,
is the core of the Great Awakening, right? This belief in the sinfulness and
helplessness of humankind and the possibility of redemption if you individually
make the choice and repent. And as suggested by Edwards&#39; sermon, there were
often some tearful emotional conversions at the big camp meetings that took
place at this time. </p>
<p>And I actually have
an eyewitness account of a camp meeting, which I offer you partly because, as
you&#39;ll see, there&#39;s an aspect of it which I consider truly ridiculous. But it&#39;s
offered by Benjamin Franklin, which I also think is interesting, and you&#39;ll see
the Enlightenment and the Great Awakening come up right against each other in
this little passage. Franklin actually is in Pennsylvania and he says he sees
Whitefield preaching to a crowd. As he describes it, </p>
<p>&quot;In 1739 arrived
among us from Ireland [correction: England] the Reverend Mr. Whitefield, who
had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher. He was at first
permitted to preach in some of our churches; but the clergy, taking a dislike
to him, soon refused him their pulpits, and he was obliged to preach in the
fields. The multitudes of all sects and denominations that attended his sermons
were enormous, and it was a matter of speculation to me, who was [correction: was
one] of that number, to observe the extraordinary influence of his oratory on
his hearers and how much they admired and respected him, notwithstanding his
common abuse of them, by assuring them that they were naturally &quot;half
beasts and half devils.&quot; </p>
<p>Being among the
crowd, &quot;being among the hindmost of the crowd&quot;--so he&#39;s towards the
back of the crowd&quot; -- &quot;I had the curiosity to learn how far he could be
heard, by retiring backwards . . .&quot; Okay. So now Franklin says, &#39;I wonder
how far I could back away and still hear him preaching.&#39; Clearfully -- Clearly,
at this moment, he&#39;s not really thinking about the message. So I backed away &quot;towards
the river, and I found his voice distinct &#39;till I came near Front Street, when
some noise in the street obscured it.&quot; And at this point you can really
hear the sort of Enlightenment come banging up against the Great Awakening.
&quot;Imagining then a semicircle, of which my distance should be the radius,&quot;
[laughter] </p>
<p>&quot;and that it was
[correction: were] filled with auditors, to each of whom I allowed two square
feet. I computed that he might well be heard by more than thirty thousand. This
reconciled me to the newspaper accounts of his having preached to twenty-five thousand
people in the fields, and to the [correction: the antient] histories of
generals haranguing whole armies of which I had sometimes doubted.&quot; </p>
<p>So he computes out
the radius, an area. Wow. You can actually be preaching to 30,000 people. Now,
that said, Franklin says by the end of the sermon--when clearly there was a
collection plate that was going to be passed around--Franklin said, </p>
<p>&quot;I first
silently resolved he should get nothing from me. I had in my pocket a handful
of copper money, three or four silver dollars and five gold pieces. As he
proceeded, I began to soften and concluded to give the copper. Another stroke
of his oratory made me ashamed of that and determined me to give the silver;
and he finished so admirably that I emptied my whole pocket into the dish, gold
and all.&quot; </p>
<p>So even Franklin sort
of has to admire and ultimately contribute to what&#39;s going on there. So even
this sort of true man of the Enlightenment found himself affected by this
oratory. </p>
<p>Okay. So what was the
impact of such Great Awakening sentiment in the colonies? Well, in part, given
the distinctive state of affairs in the colonies, it suggested to people that
they had the personal ability to change their lives through their own free
will. It was personally empowering, and in that sense it was sort of a
democratizing force. I almost hesitated when I was writing this to use the word
&quot;democratizing&quot; because I didn&#39;t want to be--As I mentioned on that
first day, you put the &quot;democracy&quot; word out there and all kinds of
lights go off, but I just couldn&#39;t think of a better word, so democratizing I&#39;ll
stick with. </p>
<p>Also, the Great
Awakening preached spiritual equality, and included women, African Americans
and the poor--and the power of making choices, though the impact of that, as
we&#39;ll see, might not have been so great. Plus it was an anti-authoritarian
force led by unorthodox preachers and people not attached to an established
church. So we have here a mix of individualism and personal empowerment and
throw in an emotional sort of righteousness. That&#39;s a really kind of a heady
mixture of feelings and ideas that would eventually help to encourage a real
spirit of political resistance. </p>
<p>Okay. I&#39;m going to
mention a few more basic things about colonial life that were different from
England. Very quickly. First, the realities of living on a frontier, which not
only fostered a sense of independence, but also a sense of community, partly in
a defensive way because of fears about Indians and because of the difficulties
of forging a homestead or creating a community. On a more positive side,
colonists generally had healthier living conditions than in England. Food was
plentiful, there were plenty of open spaces, and you can actually see this
concretely when you look at the average size of an English man and an English
woman and a colonial man and colonial woman towards the turn--the middle of the
eighteenth century. Basically, the average size of an Englishman in the middle
of the eighteenth century was 5 foot 6. And the--This made me happy. The
average size of an English woman was 5 feet, which is basically me. [laughs]
It makes me so happy to think there&#39;s a time when I was average height. I feel
so tall. However, colonial men and women on average tended to be a couple of
inches taller. So you could see--plentiful food, wide-open spaces--actually
people are healthier and bigger, which was true also among soldiers as a matter
of fact, which was interesting; you could see it. </p>
<p>This brings us to the
third major category of things that contributed to the difference--differences
in being a British American colonist. So we have the type of person who
migrated; we just had a whole bunch of living conditions in the colonies. This
is the third category, which is the nature of the British administration of the
colonies, which, as I mentioned last week, was kind of light-handed, so
colonial government and society could develop in ways that Britain might not
necessarily have desired or even recognized. One of the most striking effects
of this lack of imperial control was the power of the typical colonial
legislature. Left alone, the colonists developed strong legislatures which
often were full of very contentious individuals who felt entitled and compelled
to fight for their rights, or what I discussed last week, their English
liberties. Some of these colonial legislatures were so strong that they often
won battles against royal governors--battles that were not taken much note of
by the Crown at the time, because the Crown wasn&#39;t administering to the
colonies very closely. </p>
<p>And in fact, by the
1760s most of the colonies had in place all of the conditions necessary to be
self-governing states. They had elective assemblies and other institutions of
local government, and these institutions had broad powers over the internal
affairs of the colonies. They had a reservoir of political leaders drawn from
the elite. And colonists recognized and were jealous of their power of
self-government, and were not shy about fighting royal officials for this
power. So by the 1760s, there&#39;s a lot of things in place for these colonies, in
a sense, to be self-governing, although obviously they were not already. </p>
<p>So in summary, what
does all of this add up to? What do I mean when I refer to being a British
American? Well, we&#39;ve talked about a tradition of voicing opinions and
grievances. We&#39;ve talked about a sense of entitlement to owning property and
land. We&#39;ve talked about assumptions about active participation in the
political process. We&#39;ve talked about a willingness to take risks and fight for
what you wanted. We&#39;ve talked about an independent spirit and jealousy about
your independence. And we&#39;ve talked about relative tolerance of ethnic and
religious diversity. </p>
<p>You can hear this
sort of mixture of things in a comment by a British officer in the colonies
during the French and Indian War. And he observed and wrote back home,
&quot;&#39;Tis the nature of this people to do all in their power to pull down
every legal authority. There is no law prevailing at present here.&quot; That&#39;s
a little bit of an exaggeration I would say--but another arrogant British quote.
I always do lots of arrogant British quotes. &quot;There is no law prevailing
at present here, that I have met with, but the rule every man pleases to lay
down to himself. Every man insists upon following the dictates of his own will
without control.&quot; A little bit of an exaggeration, but you can see
certainly what he feels like he&#39;s seeing as compared with what he knows from
back in England. </p>
<p>Or as a member of the
Massachusetts legislature put it, &quot;Our people were not calculated to be
kept in any particular service. They soon grow troublesome and uneasy by
reflecting upon their folly&quot; by--&quot;in bringing themselves into a state
of subjection when they might have continued free and independent.&quot; Now
that sounds like a sort of wonderful thing, impressive, admirable, like &#39;oh,
our people are--they like to be independent and if they commit to something,
they&#39;re not happy about that commitment, because they think--wow, I could have
been free and independent; what have I done?&#39; </p>
<p>The problem with that
is: try putting a bunch of those people into an army and then expecting them to
stay in it for a long period of time. George Washington was not a happy camper
for part--a good part of the Revolution because he was stuck with a lot of
soldiers who had that point of view--like, &#39;Well, I&#39;ll do this for a little
while and then I&#39;ll leave. Bye. &quot; And so it&#39;s kind of hard to command that
kind of an army, as we&#39;ll see, and--I guess I can&#39;t say I&#39;m proud to say--Connecticut
was a problem. [laughs] Connecticut--as we&#39;ll see, Connecticut had issues;
Rhode Island too. I think I mentioned that in the first lecture, but
Connecticut too. Soldiers particularly had problems wanting to stick around,
but that was a general problem as well, the sort of spirit of independence and &#39;I&#39;ve
done what I wanted to do; I&#39;m going to now do something different.&#39; </p>
<p>So we&#39;ve looked at
being a British colonist. We&#39;ve looked at being a British American. The next
step that we&#39;re going to be taking on Thursday is going to be looking at
intercolonial relations--looking at how the colonies felt about each other,
looking at how the colonies interacted with each other, how they felt about
each other, what their sense was of any kind of cooperation or union between
these sort of colony-states. And by the end of Thursday&#39;s lecture, we&#39;re going
to see the first glimmers of tension with the passage of the Stamp Act. So by
the end of the next lecture--You can see why, when I mentioned in that first
lecture that there was someone in--when I first taught this course--who raised
his hand, probably at the end of this lecture, and said, &quot;Where are the
dates?,&quot; that we&#39;ve had two lectures without a lot of dates, but the Stamp
Act--We have an actual concrete thing coming on Thursday [laughs] and then
actual events of the Revolution. </p>
<p>But hopefully with
these three lectures you have some kind of a sense of the--sort of--foundation
of where we&#39;re working from, as we&#39;re now going to show people basically getting
upset, working themselves a logic of resistance, and then acting on that logic.
I think it&#39;s important obviously to understand where the colonists were coming
from before you plunge right in to seeing them rebelling against what they&#39;ve
had and for something else. But I think certainly in these two first lectures,
you do get a sense of some of the ways in which the colonies were prepared to
resist, or maybe predisposed to resist, and some of the reasons why it took
actually, as you&#39;ll see, a pretty long time for the colonists to decide to
actually rebel--that it took a while. People sort of let go, finger by finger,
of the British Empire. They let go, piece by piece, until finally they felt
that there was no alternative except a revolution. I will end there. I will see
you on Thursday. If you have questions, come up and see me now at the end of
class or e-mail them to me and I will see you on Thursday. </p>
