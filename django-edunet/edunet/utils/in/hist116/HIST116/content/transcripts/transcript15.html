<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>Now
I want to turn to the lecture, and I&#39;m going to start the lecture with my true
confession of the day. Okay. I did something a little insane and I&#39;m not
entirely sure how this is going to work out. I did it for you. </p>
<p>I--Basically, on the
syllabus it says that the title of this lecture is &quot;Citizenship and
Leadership&quot; or &quot;Leadership and Citizenship.&quot; I don&#39;t even
remember which one I put first. And initially, my idea had been when I wrote
the syllabus for this course before the semester even started--well, this is
going to be a lecture that has something to do with new ways of--how the Revolution
changed people&#39;s sense of themselves as citizens, how people were behaving
differently because of the approach of Revolution and then because of the
fighting of Revolution. And I was going to talk a little bit about crowd
actions and about how the Revolution itself wouldn&#39;t really have been possible
without crowd actions. I talked, I know, a little bit about mob actions and
we&#39;ve seen some in action. </p>
<p>So I was basically
going to talk about how the Revolution politicized people, how it--on a mass
scale for many different kinds of Americans--brought them in to the public
sphere, made them think and act politically in a way that perhaps they hadn&#39;t
before. And then I was going to accompany that with a brief discussion about
the elite in this environment being on the one hand appreciative of the sort of
mass popular involvement because there would be no Revolution without it--that
is the Revolution--but on the other hand they&#39;re elite folk so they&#39;re all--some
of them at least are a little nervous about all of this sort of popular
sentiment and crowd action. </p>
<p>And I even had--let
me find my favorite arrogant aristocratic quote. Okay. So I even found random
arrogant elite guy quote in 1774 who observed with true disdain: &quot;The mob
begin to think and reason.&quot; This is Gouverneur Morris, who actually has a
really great sense of humor but also he&#39;s really kind of aristocratically
disdainful. And he says he believes &quot;with fear and trembling that if the
disputes with [Great] Britain continue, we shall be under the worst of all
possible dominions. We shall be under the domination of a riotous mob.&quot;
Okay. So Gouverneur Morris is an extreme example of some sort of elite concern
about what the Revolution means, what does it mean that people are rising up.
So that was going to be today&#39;s lecture. That was my plan. </p>
<p>But when I started
thinking about the lecture and thinking about just preparing it and tweaking
it, and again I had last thought about it back in December--and you know, when
you make a syllabus for a course you think about the course, you outline it,
you think it&#39;s all going to go well, and then you get halfway through the
course and sometimes different things seem exciting to you or you suddenly get
a gut feeling that: &#39;wow, I was going to have a really abstract discussion
today, and I don&#39;t want to have an abstract discussion. [laughs] I want us to
be grounded in the actual Revolution.&#39; All of those things happened to me when
I was thinking about today&#39;s lecture, and I decided at the absolute last minute
I wasn&#39;t going to give that lecture--at literally the absolute last minute. </p>
<p>Today--This morning
for me was like a reality show called &quot;The Lecture&quot; and I was like: &#39;Freeman,
three hours--research and write a new lecture.&#39; So I was sort of frantically at
my desk. So not only did I research and write a new lecture, but it&#39;s based
entirely on primary research. So I mean--I really researched, you&#39;ll hear, and
I&#39;m going to explain in a moment what I&#39;m actually going to be lecturing on,
which is related to what I&#39;m supposed to be lecturing on. But basically I just
came up with something that to me felt more interesting, more immediate, that&#39;s
going to show some of the same things I would have been talking about in my
big, broad, general way with my leadership and citizenship lecture, but instead
I&#39;m actually going to base it on real people in a real place, sort of really
showing you as the Revolution&#39;s unfolding what happens to people in this place
and how do events and ideas affect them. So when I said I hope I have a minute
or two at the end--given that I literally was printing this out as I was
grabbing my coat to run here, hopefully this is all going to work and the
lecture will go swimmingly. This is true confessions. Right? I should never get
up in front of you and say, &quot;Maybe my lecture will die.&quot; [laughter]
Okay. Hopefully, it won&#39;t die, but I&#39;m going to aim for a grand slam, and we&#39;ll
try. </p>
<p>But one way or
another, what I am going to do today is get across some of the ideas in a
concrete way that I had been thinking I was going to approach in an abstract
way and that just didn&#39;t get me excited this morning, so it&#39;s a little
experiment for me. And what I&#39;m going to do, my little experimental thing, is
I&#39;m actually going to be talking about citizenship and leadership and the
American Revolution by focusing on Yale and New Haven. This was my brilliant
thought for the morning. Ah ha, I could focus right here. I could talk about us
here now, and look at--throughout the 1770s--some of the ways in which people
were actually experiencing the Revolution, some of the ways in which the Revolution
was getting them to take action, what it is they were doing, why they were
doing it, who was doing it, who was taking action. </p>
<p>So again we&#39;re not
just going to be looking at three elite guys in a room sort of writing
proclamations but we&#39;re actually going to be talking about students and the
people of New Haven. So that&#39;s my experimental lecture for this morning and, as
you&#39;re going to see, average New Haven residents took strong action at an early
point in the growing conflict between the colonies and Great Britain. </p>
<p>So really, in a main
and a sort of major way what we&#39;re going to be looking at is their story today,
the story of average people in New Haven. Students are kind of above average because
they would have been from more elevated families. We&#39;re going to be looking at
students too, but we&#39;re going to be looking at a lot of what&#39;s happening just
in the town of New Haven, which in a way is the best way to look at the Revolution,
which is really how it&#39;s unfolding on the ground. Plus this means I get to talk
about the British invasion of New Haven, which--I&#39;ve been waiting for my
moment. I&#39;ve never actually talked about it in this class before. I discovered
it when I was writing the introductory lecture and then having discovered it it
was like: &#39;okay, well, now I have to find a way to talk about the invasion of
New Haven.&#39; So after I had my brilliant idea I realized ha, [laughs] this means
I get to talk about the attack on New Haven in today&#39;s lecture--so that will be
there today too. Okay. </p>
<p>So let&#39;s actually
turn now to Yale and New Haven at the opening of the Revolution. And most of
the lecture today is going to focus on the 1770s, but I will mention in
starting that Yale students were certainly caught up in all of the fervor that
I&#39;ve been talking about in past lectures. And I know I mentioned once before
that Yale students decided in protest at one point to give up importing fine
wines, [laughs]--the sacrifice--on the part of Yale students. In the 1760s,
Yale students, like many other people throughout the colonies, were engaged in
acts of sort of personal protest like that, giving something up. Okay. Maybe on
the part of Yale students it was just fine wines, but still-- </p>
<p>Or on another
occasion in 1769 in response to the Townshend Acts and then the idea of non-importation,
the senior class of Yale came up with the following proclamation, which they
made publicly: </p>
<p>&quot;The Senior Class
of Yale College have unanimously agreed to make their Appearance at the next
public Commencement, when they are to take their first Degree, wholly dressed
in the Manufacturers of our [own] Country: And desire this public Notice may be
given of their Resolution, so their Parents and Friends may have sufficient Time
to be providing Homespun Cloaths for them.&quot; </p>
<p>[laughter] It was
like: &#39;we are making a proclamation. Mom, send me some clothes.&#39; [laughter]
That was like--okay. [laughs] But the feeling was there. [laughs] And even
better, they want their parents to provide homespun clothes, &quot;that none of
them may be obliged to the hard Necessity of unfashionable Singularity, by
wearing imported Cloth.&quot; Okay. &#39;Mom, if you don&#39;t send me clothes, I&#39;m
going to have to wear imported clothes and I&#39;m going to be really unpopular&#39;--so--[laughter]
guilting the parents. Okay, but anyway that&#39;s--Yale students of the 1760s
actually making acts of protest, organizing themselves into active protest. </p>
<p>Now Yale isn&#39;t unique
in this way, actually. Throughout the--this period, colonial colleges in a
variety of different places were places that tended to brew sentiment--political
sentiment that was rebellious or outraged at some of the acts being imposed by
the British government. Actually, Yale and Harvard and the College of New
Jersey, which is now Princeton, tended to be particularly well-known as sort of
seedbeds of unrest--particularly angry students who had strong political
feelings, but there were other colleges as well where the students really were
provoked to acts of protest in a variety of different ways. </p>
<p>And I--this morning
in researching for this lecture, I found a bunch of Princeton/College of New
Jersey students who decided that no one in Princeton should be drinking tea. So
they went out into the town and just personally forced their way in to people&#39;s
houses and when they found tea they burned it. That would be really popular--right?--and
then one of them said something like, &quot;That was a real frolic.&quot; [laughter]
Okay. [laughs] The town must have been very pleased. </p>
<p>I think in another
college the commencement exercises, the speeches that the students gave at a
commencement exercise, at a pretty early point actually, they debated, one for,
one and against the possibility of independence. I think that was in 1769. You
had students at one college who decided that would be what would be happening
at their commencement ceremony is they would have that debate. It&#39;s a really
early point and again, pretty radical. </p>
<p>So we&#39;re kind of
looking at a long-standing pattern of college students being bold and radical
during times of political controversy and political unrest, and this is
happening throughout the colonies in this period. And it kind of makes sense.
You have a cluster of people together and you have a variety of different
avenues, ways for students to make their thoughts known, so colleges and, as I
said, particularly Yale became known as the sort of seedbed of sedition. As one
Loyalist said of Yale in the 1770s, The college is no longer remarkable for its
scholarship but instead for &quot;its persecuting spirit, its republican
principles, its intolerance in religion&quot;--but this is a person of Loyalist
sympathies, who says, &#39;Yale used to be great. It&#39;s all downhill now. They have
those crazy, wild, radical students.&#39; Or, as a British officer put it in 1779--he
happens to be the British officer who invaded New Haven--quote, &quot;That
place (New Haven) is a spacious and very considerable town; it has the largest university
in America, and might with propriety be styled the parent and nurse of
rebellion.&quot; Okay. We are the parent and nurse of rebellion--&#39;Yale, hate
Yale.&#39; </p>
<p>Okay, but this is not
to say that colleges in this period are little isolated seedbeds of rebellion
and everybody else is sort of sitting around whittling pieces of wood, thinking,
&#39;oh, I wonder what the British are doing today.&#39; Right? It&#39;s not as though the
colleges are isolated from the communities or that the colleges only notice the
communities when they&#39;re going to go out and burn random citizens&#39; tea as they
did in New Jersey. There were obviously, there were connections between whatever
was going on in these colleges and whatever was going on in these towns, and
we&#39;re going to see that play out a couple of times in this lecture today. </p>
<p>Sometimes things that
went on in the town spread their way onto the Yale campus. An example of this
is in the late 1760s when there was a rally on the New Haven town green against
British policy, and the Yale students apparently attended that rally and got
very stirred up by the rally and decided to continue it on the Yale campus, at
which point a big group of students decided it would be a really great idea to
declare their political sentiments by toasting English radical John Wilkes. And
they decided not--And I don&#39;t know where this number came from, because I
didn&#39;t have time to research where the number came from, but you&#39;ll hear why I
questioned it. They decided that they would toast John Wilkes forty-five times.
[laughter] Okay. That&#39;s forty-five drinks. [laughs] So one observer, who I
gather from my research this morning had Loyalist sympathies, said that &quot;instead
of drinking 45 glasses in honor of Wilkes and Liberty,&quot; the Yale students &quot;drank
themselves 45 degrees in extremo DRUNK.&quot; [laughter] So we&#39;ve got
plastered Yale students like: &#39;yeah, liberty&#39;--[laughter] but that&#39;s the town
spreading into the realm of the gown. </p>
<p>Now, in the 1660s [correction:
1760s] we&#39;re seeing these sort of public demonstrations--New Haven, Yale campus
protesting policies--but not anything that dramatic happening. But things
become worse as relations between England and its colonies became worse and as
actions became more aggressive on both sides. People in New Haven, as in a lot
of other places, became more aggressive in their politics and became stronger
in their actions. They made bolder decisions, and a great example of that is
again here in New Haven, 1774. A group of about sixty men from New Haven,
normal townspeople--I&#39;m going to talk about them in a moment--decided that they
were going to hire someone to teach them military exercises so that hopefully
they would learn something and that somewhere down the road if they had to be
they could organize themselves into a military unit and protect the town of New
Haven. </p>
<p>Okay. So here&#39;s sixty
random people in New Haven who hire someone--I think they paid him three dollars
a lesson or something--to teach them how to drill, and what to do with guns,
and how to walk in formation, and basic military things so that they would know
what to do, in case they ever actually had to fight. Again that&#39;s kind of a
dramatic action. That&#39;s a big step to take. &#39;Okay. Now I need to be militarily
drilling in case I need to defend my family, my property, and my town.&#39; So
that certainly gives you a sense of what it felt like, what was sort of
floating in the air at this time for people in New Haven to take that kind of
an action. </p>
<p>In early 1775, they
met as a group and they decided that they would really organize themselves into
a real military unit, as opposed to guys taking lessons on how to drill. So
they met, they voted on uniforms, they figured out the best way to obtain arms
so that they&#39;d know where they&#39;d be getting them from, and then not long after
that they actually wrote to the Connecticut State Assembly and said that they,
quote, &quot;Anxious for the safety of our country and desirous of contributing
all in their power to the support of our just rights and liberties, have formed
themselves into a military company&quot;--and then added that they wanted the
Connecticut State Assembly to officially make them a sort of district military
unit. So they wanted official recognition from the Connecticut State Assembly. </p>
<p>Again, really
interesting--random sixty guys: &#39;maybe we better know something military.&#39; Then
after that they decide: &#39;oh, okay, well, maybe we actually had better--we could
organize ourselves so that this will actually be real. Hey, now that we&#39;ve
organized ourselves, we can actually get state recognition so that we&#39;ll be on
call and armed and ready in case something bad happens.&#39; Again kind of an
interesting chain of events, series of personal decisions on the part of those
random sixty men. </p>
<p>Now let&#39;s look for a
minute at who they are. One of them apparently owned a hat store on Chapel
Street. One of them was a barber who was described, quote, as &quot;a rather
eccentric person.&quot; I don&#39;t know what that means, although I was dying to
have the time to figure out why the barber was rather eccentric, but we have an
eccentric barber who&#39;s one of the sixty, a chair maker, a few sailors, someone
who was just described as a man of leisure--[laughter]--it&#39;s interesting to
ponder what that means--a lawyer, a few grocers. There was a grocer who lived
on State Street and a grocer who lived on the corner of Chapel and Church--and
of course for me researching this this morning, it&#39;s really fascinating to be
finding people living in places that, of course, we all know. That&#39;s always--Because
you can exactly picture: oh, the corner of Chapel and Church. I know exactly
where that person lived. </p>
<p>One person worked in
the New Haven bank, and decided that he wasn&#39;t really very skilled at
horsemanship; in case that they were going to fight, he probably would need to
know how to be really good on horseback. So apparently he regularly took his
horse into his yard and practiced on the horse in private. He took it into his
yard so no one would see that he was the guy who had to practice horsemanship,
but he was sort of there doing his own little private drilling so that he&#39;d be
prepared in case there was actual fighting. </p>
<p>Okay. So there you
see a group of people, all different levels of society--lawyers, man of
leisure, eccentric barbers, chair makers, grocers--all different levels of
society who have all come together for this one purpose and have gone over a
series of months here to increasingly become more and more serious about what
it is that they&#39;re doing. So it certainly tells you something about the mindset
in New Haven in early 1775, and not only in New Haven, as we&#39;ve already heard
in the course. </p>
<p>Things became more
dramatic on April 21, 1775, when news of the Battle of Lexington arrived in New
Haven. And what was interesting to me this morning was when I was reading
accounts of people in New Haven reporting when they heard this news, several of
them literally stated the precise time of day, like: &#39;at noon on the 21<sup>st</sup>
someone told me.&#39; They actually had it down to the hour and the minute when
they heard about the events at Lexington, which to me was really telling,
because it&#39;s what you do--afterwards--when something really momentous or tragic
or notable or historic happens, you think: where was I when that happened? Where
was I when the Challenger blew up? I was a receptionist at an advertising
agency sitting at my desk, but I remember that, because I remember everyone
around me getting upset and it was a big deal. </p>
<p>And so here are these
people kind of doing the same thing, remembering after the fact: &#39;I remember
where I was. It was noon on the 21<sup>st</sup> when we heard in New Haven that
the British had actually fired on colonists in Lexington.&#39; In New Haven, a Yale
student wrote in his diary: &quot;Today tidings of the Battle of Lexington,
which is the first engagement with the British troops, arrived at New Haven.
This filled the country with alarm and rendered it impossible for us to pursue
our studies to any profit.&quot; </p>
<p>And this is the
moment I mentioned in Tuesday&#39;s lecture when Benedict Arnold--who is one of the
men in that group of sixty guys who decide they&#39;d better arm and drill; he&#39;s
one of those men--when he decides that they need arms and they&#39;re going to march
to Massachusetts, and he sort of fights the New Haven town committee to get the
key so that he can grab arms and go march with his men up to Massachusetts. So
I&#39;m linking today&#39;s lecture with Tuesday&#39;s lecture, so I&#39;m very proud. And
actually, he and his men, as they were preparing to leave town and sort of go
off to fight, they drew up an agreement which they all signed, a sort of pledge
to each other, and a public statement as to what they were doing and why they
were doing it, which is worth quoting because you&#39;ll hear in the middle of it
something you might not expect to see in a statement being drawn up by a bunch
of guys who just--by force--armed themselves and they&#39;re going to go march to
Massachusetts to fight the British. </p>
<p>So this is the
beginning of their statement: &quot;Be it known that we, the subscribers,
having taken up arms for the relief of our brethren and defense of their, as
well as our, just rights and privileges, declare to the world that we from our
hearts [correction: &quot;the heart&quot;] disavow every thought of rebellion
to His Majesty, as supreme head of the British Empire.&quot; Okay. They&#39;ve
taken up arms, they&#39;re marching to fight the British, and the first thing they
say in the first sentence of their proclamation is we&#39;re not rebelling against
the King. That--When I read this I thought, wow, that&#39;s--And I&#39;ve been saying
over and over again in class it&#39;s--that all of these things are mixed in
together. People are upset, they&#39;re angry at what&#39;s going on, they&#39;re angry at
British policy, and they&#39;re loyal to the King, and they&#39;re thinking about
independence, but they&#39;re unsure about independence, and they&#39;re still linked
to England. </p>
<p>And in a way, that
statement is a great example of that; guys who are holding guns and about to
march to fight, are being sure to state that they are not rebelling against His
Majesty as supreme head of the British empire--or, they don&#39;t want to be
accused of &quot;opposition to his legal authority, and shall on every occasion
manifest to the world by our conduct this to be our fixed principle.&quot; So
they&#39;re not rebelling against the King. Instead they said that they were,
quote, &quot;Driven to the last necessity, and obliged to have recourse to arms
in defense of our lives and liberties.&quot; So they&#39;re saying, &#39;We&#39;re not
rebels who are out to rebel against the King. We&#39;re actually--We&#39;ve been driven
to this by what&#39;s going on in Massachusetts and we&#39;re protecting ourselves, but
this is a defensive act and not an aggressive act.&#39; </p>
<p>And then when you
read a little further on in the statement, after all of this sort of noble,
lofty sentiment, they then promise each other they&#39;re not going to get drunk or
gamble or swear. [laughs] It&#39;s down to practicalities. Now that we&#39;ve
declared our purpose to the world, no heavy drinking. Okay. </p>
<p>The next day, April
22, 1775, classes at Yale were suspended and a lot of students went home. Some,
a few, actually, went off to fight. So you can kind of see the way that the
wind is blowing in New Haven. You can imagine, given these sorts of events
potentially how much fun it would have been to be a college student with
Loyalist leanings at this particular moment. It would not have been very fun--and
sure enough in 1775 there was that student. I discovered that student this
morning. There was a--I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s the only one, but he&#39;s the guy who
got in trouble. </p>
<p>There was one college
student here at Yale who was a declared Loyalist, 1775. He did not make other
Yale students very happy. He must have been loud about being a Loyalist.
Otherwise don&#39;t know how it would have been so obvious to everyone that he was
a Loyalist, but the--a large chunk of the Yale student body decided to have a
meeting to debate what should be done about this student. Okay. Obviously,
things are not going to go well for the student. &#39;What should we do about this
student?&#39; </p>
<p>They decide that they
are going to formally denounce him as--publicly, as, quote, &quot;an enemy to
his country&quot;--and that no one will be allowed to socialize with this
student ever again. Okay. They&#39;ve just ostracized this--Can you imagine?
Sorry. &#39;You&#39;ve just been entirely ostracized from every other person at Yale
University [laughs] because we don&#39;t like your politics.&#39; So when I first found
this this morning, I was like: oh, poor guy, and I couldn&#39;t figure out what
happened next and I just felt sorry for him. Then I found a little bit more
about him and I felt a little less sorry for him because he took action. </p>
<p>Apparently, he was
from New Haven, this particular Loyalist student, so learning that he had been
ostracized by all of the Yale student body, he went home and got some of his
townie friends to go back to Yale and beat up some Yale students [laughter]--which
they did. And then the Yale students got really mad at this apparently, and
armed themselves with clubs and were going to go attack these townies when the
Yale president, Naphtali Daggett, intervened. It was like: &#39;okay, we&#39;re done
with the war now&#39;--[laughter] like, &#39;nice idea, done with the war.&#39; So the
fighting stopped and eventually--I don&#39;t know when--the Loyalist withdrew from
Yale--so, you can&#39;t blame him at this point. </p>
<p>Okay. So we have
people in New Haven forming military units and marching off to fight. We have
students ostracizing that one lone Loyalist student. Not long after this, Yale
students organized their own military company and actually began training, and
not long after that the New Haven town meeting voted, and here&#39;s what they
declared: Quote, &quot;That the Governor be desired to permit one hundred
stands of arms to be lodged in the library for the use of a company in Yale
College ... That should a company in college be formed and accoutred, they draw
half a pound of powder to each man.&quot; Okay. Yale students have just
started militarily drilling and the New Haven town meeting has voted to store
arms in the Yale library; in case the students actually get it together and
form an organized unit, they&#39;ll have arms stored in the Yale library ready in
case fighting has to happen. Which again is a really dramatic kind of a
decision to make. It&#39;s stated in a very plain way in the document that I found,
but that&#39;s a dramatic kind of a decision. </p>
<p>So again, you can see
even just in that example how some of these really general ideas I&#39;ve been
talking about over the course of many, many lectures--building resentments,
shared fears, continued loyalty to the King--are playing out here on a small
scale in New Haven in real life. </p>
<p>Now the Yale military
unit apparently had its main moment of glory that same year in 1775, when
George Washington, who was now the newly named Commander-in-Chief of the Continental
Army, actually passed through New Haven on his way to join the Continental Army
outside of Boston. And I&#39;ll be talking about George Washington in the next
lecture so I&#39;m feeling very fancy once again that I have magically somehow
seemed as though this lecture was really planned all along. </p>
<p>But apparently,
Connecticut newspapers noted that people from New Haven went out; they wanted
to see Washington; they wanted to see what was going on; they wanted to watch
the Yale students do a drill, which they did apparently--a formal drill in
front of Washington and his escort. Noah Webster, dictionary Webster, was a
Yale freshman that year, and in later years he told people that he remembered
that event; he remembered Washington watching the drilling students; he
remembered that the body of the--the military body of students, escorted
Washington out of town. And Webster said that he himself played some kind of
music to accompany the marching of the Yale students with Washington out of
town--but he remembered that a long time later as sort of a memorable moment
from the war. </p>
<p>Now in the interest
of time, I&#39;m going to leap to 1777, because in 1777 warfare now is unfolding
throughout the northern states and some people then began to conclude that
actually staying in New Haven and studying at Yale might be just too dangerous
for Yale students--because New Haven was an exposed port, which we&#39;re going to
see in about five minutes. It is an exposed port. </p>
<p>So the Yale authorities
sent students out to different towns. They didn&#39;t close Yale. They just said, &#39;Okay.
We&#39;re going to send students to random places in Connecticut where they will be
safer than they are in New Haven.&#39; So freshmen went to Farmington, sophomores and
juniors went to Glastonbury, and seniors went to Wethersfield. I cannot tell
you why those particular places seemed like logical places, but you and your
class were sent to a random place to continue your studies. On their way out,
Yale officials asked the town to please protect the abandoned college buildings
from troops--American or British--troops, and some library books were moved
inland to protect them in case troops came to New Haven. So again, people are
feeling there&#39;s a potential real threat here. </p>
<p>Yale eventually did
come back into session in New Haven, not without serious problems--and again
you&#39;re going to see the playing out here of something I&#39;ve talked about before.
I&#39;ve talked before about the problems of supplying the army. It was hard to get
food. People weren&#39;t sort of giving up food and supplies to the army.
Apparently, they--it was really hard for people to get food and supplies into
Yale too, that people just weren&#39;t--whatever sources of supplies had been
serving Yale in the past were no longer doing that in a time of war. </p>
<p>So in 1778, Yale sent
out the following notice to parents of Yale students. September 30, 1778: &quot;The
steward of Yale College hereby requests the Parents and Guardians of the Students
to assist in furnishing a supply of Provisions&quot;--okay, &#39;parents, would you
please send food? [laughs] We don&#39;t have a lot; we really need it&#39;--&#39;&quot;without
which it will be very difficult if not impracticable for him to subsist the Scholars
the ensuing winter. A generous and full Price shall be allowed and paid either
in Money, or their Son&#39;s Quarter Bills, shall be most agreeable.&quot; Okay. &#39;Please
send us food. We don&#39;t have any, and if you do we&#39;ll either pay you or we won&#39;t
charge you tuition for your son so please give us food&#39;--which again--Can you
imagine being the parent who gets the sorry, there&#39;s no food for your son; [laughter]
send some now? While you&#39;re sending the homespun clothes, send the food too. </p>
<p>Okay. So the war is a
real presence, even on the college campus: drilling students, fighting men,
guns stored in the Yale library, people having a hard time getting food and
supplies. 1779 is when things become much worse because that is the peak year
of violence in New Haven; that is the year when the British invaded New Haven.
And Ezra Stiles, who was President of Yale at the time, noted in his diary the
events as they unfolded--and again, it&#39;s really interesting to see his diary
entries. He later wrote another account that had full sentences, but to me what
was more interesting--and I&#39;ll read some of them here--were some of his diary
entries because they&#39;re really immediate, and he&#39;s kind of recording his
reaction to events as they&#39;re happening. </p>
<p>So on July 4, 1779,
he says he heard news that there was a British fleet of ships that had been
seen near Bridgeport, and supposedly rumor said it was heading to New Haven. So
again, being the responsible president of Yale, he asks for militia to be sent.
In case this is actually true, they&#39;re going to need some real soldiers, but he
writes in his diary: &quot;Would not believe the enemy intended landing.&quot;
Okay. He hears the rumor and he takes action but he actually literally cannot
believe that the British are actually going to get off the ships and attack.
That can&#39;t be real; can&#39;t be really happening. </p>
<p>The next day, July 5,
Stiles, using a telescope, says that he &quot;saw the ships distinctly from the
steeple of College Chapel&quot; and, he continues, &quot;Began to remove all
property. . . . Militia meeting. Tories calm. With telescope from the tower or
steeple clearly saw the boats putting off from the ship and landing a little
after sunrise.&quot; He sees the smaller boats going off of these ships, with
soldiers, to land on the shore. &quot;Immediately, I sent off College records
and papers ... and a bag of my own things,&quot; sent his family away. The next
day, July 6, Stiles writes: &quot;Enemy paraded. Sailors came on shore and
took their turn at plunder.&quot; </p>
<p>I&#39;m going to continue
a couple days here and then go back to the actual invasion, just because the
series of things he writes here are interesting and they become weirdly
personal, which again reminds me that this is a real person&#39;s experience. He
says: July 7, 11 o&#39;clock p.m., &quot;enemy landed and burnt Fairfield.&quot;
July 8, &quot;Removing my furniture&quot;--(he&#39;s now moving his furniture out
of Yale) -- &quot;Removing my furniture broke my Fahrenheit Thermometer which I
have had since 1762.&quot; [laughter] I was like: oh, okay, I feel sorry
you&#39;re moving your furniture and he broke his thermometer. July 12, &quot;the
whole town moving,&quot; and then July 23 this little, tiny reminder that Yale
is still an institution that exists. July 23, Stiles spent the day writing
diplomas onto parchment. [laughs] &#39;Yeah, I know this is a little taxing. I&#39;ve
still got students and they still have to graduate so I&#39;m going to write out
their diplomas&#39;--which I think is really kind of striking. </p>
<p>Okay. Let&#39;s turn back
for a minute to look at precisely what happened as the British invaded New
Haven. Apparently, they decided to attack the Connecticut shore to draw some of
Washington&#39;s troops away from White Plains, New York, where I guess they were,
and that was I guess a strong position to hold, so the British thought well, if
they attack the Connecticut shore, they&#39;ll entice Washington to send some of
his troops to Connecticut and that way maybe they can defeat them on both
fronts. </p>
<p>And New Haven ends up
being the first target in this plan, so on July 5 the British debark in New
Haven Harbor. They had about two thousand soldiers. One part of the troops was
going to enter New Haven from East Haven and the other part was going to enter
from West Haven. Stiles wrote in his diary, &quot;Perhaps one-third of the
adult male inhabitants flew to arms and went out to meet them. A quarter [were]
moved out of town doing nothing, the rest remained unmoved, partly Tories,
partly timid Whigs,&quot; and then he adds that some of the Tories armed
themselves and then went out to fight with the British. </p>
<p>That&#39;s a great
example of how our--I think our impulse is to say, &#39;Well, the people were united
in unity against the British.&#39; It&#39;s like--well, no. The entire town wasn&#39;t a big
lump--a big lump of rebels. It was people with different ideas, and you just--Stiles
in that one little sentence--He has people going to fight with the British,
people going to fight against the British. He has people sort of not knowing
what to do and kind of just staying in town and then people not wanting to do
anything, just wanted to get themselves out of there--all sort of happening at
the same time. People are making decisions, some pretty dramatic decisions, and
they&#39;re having to make them spur of the moment, and you can see them in a lot
of cases here taking a side, taking a formal side in a way that could have
pretty dire consequences. </p>
<p>Yale immediately was
dismissed, and some students immediately ran for home. Supposedly, according to
a diary, one student, a sophomore, instead of going home decided to go to a
nearby town and read Blackstone&#39;s<i> Commentaries</i>. Why that made sense I
don&#39;t know. &#39;What, the British are coming? I think I&#39;ll go to Fairfield and
read Blackstone now.&#39; [laughter] And in later years, he said he so enjoyed
himself reading Blackstone during that period that he decided to become a
lawyer right there and then. Okay. It&#39;s this one lone little reading calm
student in the midst of not a lot of other reading calm students from what I
could tell. </p>
<p>Unlike that little
Blackstone student, a volunteer company of about seventy Yale students--which
is roughly half of the student body at that point--formed to fight. They were
led by Captain James Hillhouse. He is indeed New Haven Hillhouse. He was a Yale
graduate of a few years before, so he&#39;s not that much older than these men. And
a Yale senior, who ends up being one of these fighting Yale students, offers an
account of what happened at this point. He says--He notes that troops landed in
the south part of West Haven, </p>
<p>&quot;about five
miles from the center of the town. College was of course broken up and the
students, with many of the inhabitants, prepared to flee on the morrow into the
neighboring country. To give more time for preparation and especially for the
removal of goods, a volunteer company of about a hundred young men was formed,
not with the expectation of making any serious stand against such a force, but
simply of retarding or diverting its march.&quot; </p>
<p>So these students
formed; they don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to beat the British, but maybe they can
delay them a little bit. &quot;In common with others of the students, I was one
of the number, and I well remember the surprise we felt the next morning (July
5) as we were marching over West Bridge towards the enemy, to see Dr. Daggett,&quot;
who is the former President of Yale, Naphtali Daggett, who is now a professor
of divinity, so he&#39;s a Yale professor, </p>
<p>&quot;how surprised
we were the next morning, to see Dr. Daggett riding furiously by us on his old
black mare with his long fowling piece in his hand ready for action. We knew
the old gentleman had studied the matter thoroughly and satisfied his own mind
as to the right and propriety of fighting it out, but we were not quite
prepared to see him come forth in so gallant a style to carry his principles
into practice.&quot; </p>
<p>So, they see this
professor go riding off with his gun, going to fight the British, like: &#39;wow, [laughs]
that&#39;s pretty impressive.&#39; And I think in the first lecture I mentioned this,
and said it was the President of Yale riding out. Daggett had retired as President,
so for the sake of accuracy, he&#39;s now not President but a professor riding off
to fight the British with his gun. So now this student goes on: </p>
<p>&quot;Giving him a [hearty]
cheer as he passed, we turned down towards West Haven at the foot of the
Milford Mills [correction: Milford Hill??], while he [Daggett] ascended a
little to the west and took his station in a copse of wood where he seemed to
be reconnoitering the enemy like one who was determined &#39;to bide his time.&#39; As
we passed on towards the south we met an advanced guard of the British, and
taking our stand at a line of fence, we fired upon them several times, and then
chased them the length of three or four fields as they retreated, until we
suddenly found ourselves involved with the main body&quot;--</p>
<p>Okay, [laughter] so
it was--a couple of soldiers were like: &#39;get them, uh oh [laughter]--&quot;and
in danger of being surrounded. It was now our turn to run, and we did for our
lives. Passing by Dr. Daggett [laughs] in his station on the hill we retreated
rapidly across West Bridge, which was instantly taken down by persons who stood
ready for the purpose to prevent the enemy from entering the town by that road.&quot;
</p>
<p>Okay. So that&#39;s where
his account ends. Now we&#39;re going to pick it up with Daggett who offered his
own account afterwards of what happened. Okay. </p>
<p>&quot;On Monday
morning, the 5<sup>th</sup> inst. the town of New Haven was justly alarmed,
with the threatening appearance of a speedy invasion from the Enemy. Numbers
went out armed to oppose them. ... Having gone as far as I supposed was
sufficient, I turned down the hill to gain a little covert of bushes which I
had in my eye; but to my great surprise I saw the Enemy much nearer than I
expected, their advance guards being a little more than 20 rods distant, [with]
plain open ground between us. They instantly fired upon me, which they
continued till I had run a dozen rods, discharging not less than 15 or 20 balls
at me alone; however thro&#39; the preserving providence of God, I escaped [from]
them all unhurt, and gained the little covert at which I aimed, which concealed
me from their view, while I could plainly see them thro&#39; the weeds and bushes,
advancing towards me within 12 rods. I singled out one of them, took aim and
fired upon him.&quot; </p>
<p>Okay. So he takes one
shot. &quot;I loaded my musket again, but determined not to discharge it any more,
[and] as I saw I could not escape from them [laughs] [and] I determined to
surrender myself as a prisoner.&quot; So he&#39;s charged out with his gun, he
takes one shot, and he&#39;s like: &#39;what am I doing? [laughter] I&#39;m a guy with a
gun and the British Army. What am I doing?&#39; He&#39;s like: &#39;okay, I&#39;ll surrender
myself as a prisoner.&#39; </p>
<p>&quot;I begged for Quarter
and that they would spare my life. They drew near to me, I think two only in
number, one on my right hand, the other on my left, the fury of infernals
glowing in their faces, they called me a damned old Rebel and swore they would
kill me instantly. They demanded, quote, &#39;What did you fire upon us for?&#39;&quot;
[laughter] </p>
<p>Okay. I love the
question. &#39;Why are you shooting at us, you old crazy man sitting in the bushes?&#39;
&quot;I replied, &#39;because it is the exercise of war.&#39;&quot; [laughter] That
did not impress the British, and apparently, they actually--they didn&#39;t treat
him very well so they--one of them pretended to stab at him with his bayonet
and actually stabbed him a little bit, and some of them sort of [laughter] hit
him on the head, and there&#39;s a long account here which I don&#39;t have time to
read in which he talks about: &#39;this guy hit me in the head and that guy hit me
on the shin and then some guy hit me with the barrel of his gun.&#39; </p>
<p>And he actually--he
ends up being forced to march at the head of the British troops back to New
Haven, from wherever he is. And he says I think in his account, &#39;I finally--I
saw the New Haven green and I was so happy I was back in New Haven.&#39; But I
think he--Oh, and also I should say they stole his shoes, his knee buckles, his
pocket handkerchief, and a little, old tobacco box, so they also just stripped
him of whatever he had, but he actually I think was kind of badly hurt and he&#39;s
sick for a while. And then a couple years later he died, and people later said
that maybe he died because of injuries sustained at that moment after the crazy
charge of one guy, the noble professor going off to fight the British. </p>
<p>Okay. So troops
entered New Haven proper a little after noon after one last skirmish where
Whaley and Dixwell meet. This was the last little skirmish and then the British
entered. They entered New Haven and immediately began to plunder Loyalist and Rebel
houses alike, breaking windows and doors, carrying off valuables. As Stiles
described it, &quot;Plunder, Rape, Murder, Bayoneting, Indelicacies toward the Sex&quot;--okay,
women were not being treated respectfully -- &quot;Insolence and Abuse and Insult
toward the Inhabitants in general.&quot; </p>
<p>One woman later
recalled that a British soldier in town cut off her necklace to keep, and stole
her shoe buckles. Someone who lived on State Street said he was sitting in his
door on State Street as the British came, and he saw a British officer come
riding down Elm Street and turn up State Street towards Grove, and then he saw
someone he knew from East Haven ride over, holding a musket which he leveled
and fired at the British officer, who fell off his horse and sort of crawled
into someone&#39;s garden at which point the East Haven guy grabbed the officer&#39;s
horse and rode away. &#39;So [laughter] I shot me someone from the British Army,
and I got a horse too.&#39; </p>
<p>Some people fled
town. One man who was stuck in town with his wife because she was too ill to
run, saw British officers enter town and apparently went up to one and asked
for protection and the officer asked, &#39;Are you a friend to King George?,&#39; and
the man said, &#39;I am,&#39;--so his house was not attacked, but apparently he was not
a friend to King George, he was not a Tory, so for there, after in the town he
was someone who was highly unpopular because he had--I suppose in a sense--sold
himself out to protect his house; again a sort of decision of the moment that
makes sense but that then had implications. Some New Haven Loyalists actually
fled with the British Army, which as they left, actually, they left a lot of
destruction in their wake. </p>
<p>Okay. So what have we
seen today? We&#39;ve definitely seen how ideas and events happening in places
pretty far removed from New Haven are distilling their way down, right here--Yale
College, New Haven, Connecticut--and really driving people to take action,
sometimes pretty dramatic action. We&#39;ve seen average citizens, average people
from New Haven, stirred to act: merchants, lawyers, sailors, shoemakers,
students. We&#39;ve seen how the coming of war revealed all kinds of divisions
among local people, as well as unity, because people did have to make choices
of all kinds. </p>
<p>So basically, we&#39;ve
seen in this one little real-life example how the coming of the Revolution and
then the carrying out of the Revolution drove average people to become
politically active and also militarily active, to think through their options,
to decide what they really believed, and then in many cases to take a stand. So
Professor Daggett--The student says, &#39;We know he&#39;d been thinking about it and
he had been thinking about what he wanted to do and he had decided that if
pushed, he would fight.&#39; The student is kind of surprised he&#39;s actually
heading out with a gun, but again--the student knows that Daggett was thinking
through what his actions were going to be, and then he watches him take action,
like the Loyalists who left New Haven with the British; again a really dramatic
action. </p>
<p>So in just this
little sort of case study of New Haven and Yale, you can see how citizenship
and leadership came to have different meanings, how people were understanding
what they were supposed to be doing as citizens in a different way as they
lived the experience of fighting a Revolution. </p>
<p>Okay. I ended that on
time. I even read my--I&#39;m so impressed with myself--[laughs/laughter] the
instant lecture. Okay. And I ended two minutes early, so you have time to get
your midterms. Have a wonderful spring break, and I will see you after. </p>
