<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>So
let&#39;s actually begin today&#39;s lecture, which is titled &quot;Ever At Variance and
Foolishly Jealous--Intercolonial Relations.&quot; And the quote part of that title,
&quot;Ever At Variance and Foolishly Jealous,&quot; actually comes from a colonist named
Joseph Warren who was writing to a friend, probably 1766, I think--it doesn&#39;t
matter; it&#39;s--actually the quote&#39;s not highly significant for you--but the
point of it is, he was writing to a friend and what he says to his friend is:
until the passage of the Stamp Act the colonies had always been, quote,
&quot;ever at variance and foolishly jealous,&quot; which is kind of going to
be the point of today&#39;s lecture. &quot;Ever at variance and foolishly jealous&quot;--but
now with the Stamp Act, boy, people seemed to be a little bit more united. So
today&#39;s lecture is the foolishly jealous part and on Tuesday we plunge into the
Stamp Act, which moves us to the more united part and actually begins a sort of
series of events that are actually going to build up to a logic of resistance. </p>
<p>So I&#39;m going to be
talking today about basically intercolonial relations, about how people in the
different colonies viewed each other, about how the colonies as entities
interacted with each other, and towards the end of the lecture I&#39;m going to
talk about colonial attempts before the 1760s for them to unite--colonial
attempts to unite and act together--and, as we&#39;re going to see today, they
weren&#39;t really amazingly successful, those attempts, so--and there were only
three of them that I&#39;m going to talk about--but unity is not taken for granted.
That, I suppose, will be one message of today&#39;s lecture: Don&#39;t take unity--colonial
unity for granted. And that&#39;s going to lead us up perfectly to the next lecture
on the Stamp Act crisis, which is then going to have people shifting a point of
view because of the crisis at hand. Okay. </p>
<p>So basically, in a
way, today&#39;s lecture is the third and last in a series of lectures that&#39;s
really been laying the groundwork for our immersion into colonial conflict. So
we&#39;ve looked at the links between colonists and the mother country, we&#39;ve
looked at aspects of colonial life and settlement that were kind of distinctly
colonial American, and now we&#39;re sort of laying the last plank in, of the
British-American mindset at the time, and that&#39;s: how the colonies were
relating with each other. Okay. And I--again I sort of--in Freeman&#39;s Top Five
Tips that I offered in the introductory lecture that I gave, the Top Five Tips
Towards Understanding the Revolution--and I said, &quot;remember contingency&quot;--and I
suppose that&#39;s a sort of subtheme of today&#39;s lecture, because we so assume the
logic and inevitability of a unified nation at some point down the pike. I think
it&#39;s really easy for us to forget some of the things that I&#39;m going to be
talking about today, which all add up to: unity did not make sense a lot of the
time. </p>
<p>Now I think to really
appreciate ultimately how significant the first little glimmerings at union
were, we first have to understand the vast differences between the different
colonies and the different regions, because people at the time definitely did.
They were always complaining and remarking on people from other regions, about
how weird they were, about their bizarre manners, about the weird way they
dressed, about their strange attitude: constantly, people from all regions, all
colonies sort of remarking in a not necessarily favorable way about people from
other places. </p>
<p>And I want to start--I
want to offer you a couple of examples, and I want to start with Thomas
Jefferson, who in the 1780s devoted some of his energies to explaining America
to a French audience. And as you&#39;ll hear in some of these quotes, he&#39;s going to
definitely be sounding like a Virginian. And of course what&#39;s interesting to
note about Jefferson is--I&#39;ll quote him another time in today&#39;s lecture--Jefferson&#39;s
strongest remarks about America or American character are always made to a
foreign audience. Right? He doesn&#39;t make them to Americans. So like, <i>Notes
on the State of Virginia, </i>which has some remarkable passages in it--he
didn&#39;t think that Americans were going to be reading that. That was actually
for a French audience and it sort of came back across the ocean. So a lot of
what I&#39;m going to be quoting here today, he was not quoting for Americans. He&#39;s
actually speaking to the French, which--You can say a lot of blunt things to
the French that you wouldn&#39;t necessarily say to fellow Americans.</p>
<p>So, okay. In 1786,
he wrote to a French correspondent who clearly had written to him in some way
and said, &quot;Tell me about America.&quot; So Jefferson writes back, and I&#39;m
going to talk a little bit about his view of all of the states, but in this
particular instance he writes back and says he&#39;s very curious about why Rhode
Island is opposed to every useful proposition. Okay. I told you about Rhode
Island. I forewarned you about Rhode Island. We have to have a Rhode Island
moment here because it appears--it&#39;s going to appear again and I mentioned also
that Connecticut was going to appear again--Rhode Island was particularly
troublesome. It was actually the last state to join the Union, and it actually
joined the Union after the Constitution had already gone into effect. So when
Washington becomes President and he goes on his first grand triumphal tour--&#39;I
will now go around the nation showing everyone that I am President&quot;--he first
swings through the North, and he actually refuses to cross the border into
Rhode Island because Rhode Island is a foreign country, and he doesn&#39;t want to
go there. Okay. He was making kind of a strong statement. Rhode Island wasn&#39;t
really happy about this but it was their fault because they hadn&#39;t ratified the
Constitution yet. A really popular thing to do at the time in taverns was to
drink 12 toasts, not 13, as a deliberate insult to Rhode Island, [laughter]
like -- &#39;so there, Rhode Island.&#39; Of course, you also get to drink 12 toasts
that day, and that&#39;s the other happy thing about that, but at any rate--[laughter].
So Rhode Island is an issue, and it&#39;s going to come up again today even. </p>
<p>So Jefferson was
trying to figure out, what is the deal about Rhode Island? And here is what he--how
he explains it. Rhode Island&#39;s &quot;geography accounts for it with the aid of one
or two observations. The cultivators of the earth are the most virtuous
citizens.&quot; (It&#39;s very Jeffersonian.) Merchants are the least virtuous. </p>
<p>&quot;The latter reside
principally in the seaport towns, the former in the interior country. Now, it
happened that of the territory constituting Rhode Island and Connecticut, the
part containing the seaports was erected into a State by itself, and called
Rhode Island, and that containing the interior country was erected into another
State called Connecticut. For though it has a little sea-coast, there are no
good ports in it. Hence it happens that there is scarcely one merchant in the
whole State of Connecticut, while there is not a single man in Rhode Island who
is not a merchant of some sort,&quot; </p>
<p>which is probably a
little bit of an exaggeration. &quot;This circumstance has decided the characters of
the [correction: these] two States and the remedies to this evil are hazardous.
One would be to consolidate the two States into one.&quot; Right? That&#39;s a really
popular idea. &quot;Another would be to banish Rhode Island from the Union.&quot; [laughter]
Thank you, Thomas Jefferson. Is anyone here from Rhode Island? Are there no
Rhode Islanders? Am I bashing safely? Wow. [laughter] No one can come get me.
One time someone did say, &#39;Excuse me. [laughter] I&#39;m from Rhode Island.&#39; [laughter]
So [laughs] I&#39;m safe. This is dangerous. </p>
<p>So number one, you
could consolidate Connecticut and Rhode Island. Number two, you could banish
Rhode Island from the union. Number three would be to compel the submission of
Rhode Island to the will of the other states. Right? He has an issue with Rhode
Island, but Rhode Island has issues. He&#39;s speaking partly as a southerner but a
lot of other people had questions about Rhode Island as well. </p>
<p>At about the same
time, different French correspondent, once again Jefferson is writing about the
character of the northern states and the character of the southern states. And
Jefferson writes: &quot;In the North they are cool, sober, laborious,
persevering, independent, jealous of their own liberties and just to those of
others, interested, chicaning, (cheating) superstitious and hypocritical in
their religion.&quot; Thank you, Thomas Jefferson. &quot;In the South they are fiery,
voluptuary, indolent, unsteady, independent, zealous for their own liberties but
trampling on those of others, generous, candid, without attachment or
pretensions to any religion but that of the heart.&quot; Spoken like a
Virginian. And according to Jefferson, as he explains to this Frenchman,
&quot;An observing traveler without the aid of a quadrant may always know his
latitude by the character of the people among whom he finds himself&quot; --
like, he really believes that it&#39;s very different people in the different
colonies. And to Jefferson, Pennsylvania was sort of the perfect happy medium
where the two characters kind of met and blended and formed a people which, as
he put it, were &quot;free from the extremes both of vice and virtue.&quot; Now, that&#39;s
Jeffersonian rhetoric. There&#39;s a lot of Jeffersonian rhetoric. </p>
<p>George Washington, a
man of much fewer words, put his views about the North a lot more succinctly.
Okay. To Washington, New Englanders were, as he put it in 1777, right when he
joined the continental army, and the continental army is in Massachusetts--Washington
joins the army, he heads up to Massachusetts and the army is largely made of
New Englanders; he confronts the army and he writes to a friend and says,
&quot;New Englanders are an exceeding dirty and nasty people.&quot; [laughs]
Okay. That&#39;s us. [laughs] Sorry, father of our country. We didn&#39;t live up to
his demands. </p>
<p>Now New Englanders,
to be fair, had similar feelings about the South. Right? They thought
southerners were snooty, aristocratic, proud. I once in a diary came across a
passage in which there&#39;s a Pennsylvanian and he&#39;s sitting at a dinner table
with some Virginians, and in his diary of course he&#39;s complaining about this
because he says all they did through the entire dinner was talk about gambling,
horse racing, Virginia ham and drinking and drinking and drinking and drinking.
And apparently to this Pennsylvanian I guess that&#39;s what Virginia is, gambling
and drinking. Virginia. </p>
<p>Now John Adams, with
a little bit of a dose of Puritan guilt, felt that New Englanders were the best
trained in the school of popular government but that they weren&#39;t really
skilled in personal relations. As he put it, &quot;New Englanders are awkward,
bashful, pert, ostentatious and vain, a mixture which excites ridicule and
gives disgust.&quot; Some part of me thinks he was speaking about himself, which he
could have been. &quot;Southerners,&quot; he claims, &quot;were skilled at display
and gentlemanly manners&quot; but according to Adams &quot;they were habituated
to higher notions of themselves and the distinction between them and the common
people than we are.&quot; So they&#39;re basically snootier according to John
Adams. </p>
<p>So comments like all
of these are reminders about how very different these sort of colony-countries
were from each other. They did each have different distinctive characters and,
maybe equally important, they often distrusted one another. So in a sense,
colonies often had more of a connection with the mother country than with each
other. Now this is partly due to pragmatic concerns like bad roads, like the
fact that there actually was not a huge bustling amount of intercolonial trade
because colonies really did focus their trading energies on the mother country
and not so much with each other, and then also there were a lot of border
conflicts between colonies which caused distrust and complications between
colonies and also helped to discourage trade. Now the colonies were hostile to
each other because they were seeing to their own interests, but also, as kind
of reflected in the comments that I opened the lecture with, there also was
just basic cultural distrust. </p>
<p>Now as I head into
this, it&#39;s worth noting that there actually were three different types of
colonies. There were three different ways in which colonies were founded, and
these differences could sometimes affect the structure of the colony and its
relations with the mother country. So this is going to be a very quick and
dirty version of these three kinds of colonies. Type of colony number one: You
had corporate colonies, like Connecticut and Rhode Island, incorporated by
Puritans who left Massachusetts. And basically, a corporate colony made its own
constitution, and it was then ratified by the King. So these are independently
founded colonies. They&#39;re clearly independent in spirit, which makes them
potentially troublesome--not potentially troublesome; it just makes them
troublesome. So corporate colonies is type of colony number one. </p>
<p>You also had
proprietary colonies, like Pennsylvania and Maryland, where the King would give
ownership of the colony to someone. So for example, William Penn is the
proprietor in Pennsylvania; Lord Baltimore is the proprietor in Maryland. </p>
<p>So you have corporate
colonies, you have proprietary colonies, and the third kind of colony is a
royal colony, which is owned by the King. So royal colonies include New York,
South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Massachusetts, just the whole range of
colonies that I basically haven&#39;t named in those earlier colonies. A lot of
these colonies were royal colonies; they were owned by the King. </p>
<p>Now of the three, in
some ways corporate colonies were the closest to what would eventually become
states, because corporate colonies had drawn up their own constitution; they
made their own charter. And what that actually--and the charter was made by the
people who lived in the colony. And what that actually means, is once
independence is declared and all of these newly-created states need to create a
new constitution which writes out royal authority, Connecticut kind of had its
own little charter and Rhode Island too, to begin with. They kind of were
already there as little independent entities. They were a little ahead of the
game. They sort of had their own constitution that needed a little tweaking,
but really all these other colonies were sort of starting from scratch. </p>
<p>Okay. So those are
kind of basic structural institutional differences between these three kinds of
colonies. But beyond their basic structure, there are also things about the
social structure and the culture of the different regions of the colonies that
differentiated them and bred some distrust. So let&#39;s just look for just a few
minutes at the different regions and let&#39;s start with New England. Now
logically enough--this is not a surprise--New England had the most structured
institutional base of the colonies because of its Puritan roots. So just think
about the whole idea of a New England town, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about
here. In general, New England colonies were divided into townships; each
township was oriented around the church. Traditionally speaking, your church
fathers were your town fathers. The church felt responsible not only for your
soul in church but also for your soul as displayed in your everyday life, so
there actually were church officials who sometimes went from home to home to be
sure that you were living properly, abiding by godly standards of living--and
that&#39;s a sort of really strong institutional base of settlement. </p>
<p>Now as commerce
boomed in New England, the sort of pure church-orientation of New England
society got a little bit diluted, but still, it had an enormous impact on the
tone of life in the northern colonies. Also, because of New England&#39;s Puritan
roots and the Puritan respect for the word as presented in the Bible --and you
needed to be able to read and understand the Bible for yourself--literacy was
particularly high in the New England colonies. And New England colleges,
Harvard and Yale, were generally superior to most of the other colleges at the
time, although King&#39;s College in New York, which is now Columbia, and the
College of New Jersey, which is now Princeton, also ranked high. William and
Mary in Virginia was kind of in a different league and I&#39;m going to come back
to that, and also to UVA, which is where I got my Ph.D., in a few minutes. </p>
<p>Now New England was
mostly composed of small farms supported by family labor. And there was some
slave labor; it was the least in all of the colonies, and there were roughly thirty-five
white Europeans to every one slave. Because of its original Puritan origins--so,
because of its original focus on excluding all but the like-minded who shared
their religious sense of purpose--New England was not really diverse
religiously or ethnically. And it was this lack of diversity, the kind of
insular nature of New England society, that made many people think of New
Englanders as kind of--well, their word for it was unmixed--sort of stiff and
awkward: they&#39;re not used to being out in the world, they don&#39;t know how to
have conversations with people who aren&#39;t like them, they&#39;re sort of weird
because they only know other New Englanders. But, the same sort of relative
lack of diversity also allowed New Englanders to unite quickly and powerfully
if they felt that their rights were being impinged upon, as we&#39;ll see during
the first phases of the Revolution, within the next week or so. So that&#39;s New
England. </p>
<p>The middle colonies
in at least one way were the precise opposite of New England because they were
actually the most diverse of all of the colonies. The middle colonies were
flooded by immigrants from Germany, from Ireland, from Scotland, to name just a
few countries. And as a matter of fact the middle colonies were considered, in
a phrase used at the time, &quot;the best poor man&#39;s country&quot; because there
were ample supplies of land and there weren&#39;t harsh restrictions or great
intolerance of diversity. </p>
<p>And part of the
reason why it was so popular for immigrants is because of the great tolerance
of the Quakers who founded the colony. Though Pennsylvania, like Massachusetts,
was founded by basically a group of religious dissenters, the Quaker faith was
quite different from Puritanism. And it was much more focused on regulating
society according to your internal moral spirit rather than through
institutional, sort of church-oriented structures. So there were fewer external
rules and regulations controlling Pennsylvania society in the way there would
have been in New England, and it was a lot easier for people who arrived in the
middle colonies to adapt to living there. And tolerance was also integral to
the Quaker faith, so again, it&#39;s easier for immigrants to deal with arriving to
the middle colonies. </p>
<p>Also the middle
colonies, unlike New England and the South, were kind of less of a coherent
region. And particularly New York and Pennsylvania, although they&#39;re both
lumped into middle colony-ness, they seemed to share fewer similarities, and
it&#39;s why at the time you don&#39;t really hear people dividing the colonies into
thirds. They do tend to break it into halves and they do tend to talk about
northern or eastern colonies and southern colonies and they sort of shove
Pennsylvania north and shove Maryland south, obviously thinking generally about
slavery as a helpful dividing line. </p>
<p>Now that said, to
people at the time New York was particularly problematic, and in some ways some
people actually considered New York to be more southern than northern.
Jefferson actually said that at the time. He thought that New York was in the
wrong place--that somehow geographically it ended up far more north than it
should have been. It should be a southern state. And what he meant by that was:
unlike a lot of other states or colonies actually, not yet states, colonies, it
was organized around great landowners who owned vast expanses of land. And
although in all of the colonies there were sort of great families who controlled
or who certainly had a lot of power, in New York politics was really largely
organized around the clash between a handful of great families. </p>
<p>And the Livingstons
are the sort of largest and most noteworthy political clan in New York, and I
can vouch to you as a historian of this time period that when you&#39;re studying
New York politics there are a million Livingstons and they&#39;re all named
Philip. [laughs] Trying to tell which Livingston is which Livingston is
really hard. There are a lot of Livingstons and they all--a lot of them are in
power. </p>
<p>Other people
commented not necessarily that New York seemed southern, but that it had really
high-toned manners, that the people were really aristocratic, that they were
very interested in fine living and display than some of the surrounding more
northern colonies. And some people considered New Yorkers shifty,
self-interested and subtle. There&#39;s one account I came across in which this
fellows says--basically he says he thinks New Yorkers are all liars, but the way
he puts it is something like: New Yorkers are all guilty of telling great
thumpers, [laughs] and I guess a great thumper is a big lie. </p>
<p>And actually that
same diary--Okay. This really surprised me. I suppose -- you know, very often--this
is true with slang too--you consider slang or other things as being really,
really modern, and then you discover it actually isn&#39;t really modern; it dates
all the way back. I found a letter once from this time period in which someone
said, &quot;I wanted to give So-and-So a good swift kick in the can.&quot;
Right? Okay. I don&#39;t expect someone to say that in 1799, &quot;a good swift kick in
the can.&quot; The can?--they&#39;re saying that--I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s a little sort of
more cas than I thought they would be in 1799. </p>
<p>But so in this diary
account this person is talking about New York. He&#39;s a Pennsylvanian and he says
New Yorkers talk really fast, walk really fast, they do everything really fast
in New York. They&#39;re sort of really businesslike and abrupt. It actually just
doesn&#39;t sound very different from what someone today would say visiting New
York City for the first time. But he also describes--and now I&#39;m going to
embarrass myself fully--he also describes what he calls the New York walk,
which in his mind--He thinks all New Yorkers walk this way, which I guess is
kind of bent over and walking very fast, so in his--and he does a little
imitation of it. Apparently, in his diary he talks about it. So he is looking
at New York. Basically his impression--you almost could read someone today making
a very similar observation about New York. </p>
<p>So New York,
Pennsylvania, middle colonies: a bit different. Considering though, these
differences between New York and Pennsylvania, years later, after the
Constitution kicks in, they actually become an enormous issue because they
begin to play into the question of where the national capital should be located.
Because the general belief at the time was, wherever the capital ended up being
located would determine the manners of the national office-holders and thus
determine the sort of manner and character of the nation. Right? So, wherever
you&#39;re living is going to shape how you act--so the national office holders are
going to act--if they&#39;re in New York--kind of snooty, and then the American
public&#39;s going to look at these snooty people and they&#39;re going to try to act
like the snooty people, and thus all of America will become aristocratic and
corrupt and that&#39;s the end of the republican experiment in government. Darn.
Right? </p>
<p>So that was kind of
the logic at the time so people had a lot of attitudes about whether the
capital should be in New York or should be in Philadelphia, actually in
Pennsylvania. The idea being that Pennsylvania seemed more ideal because it&#39;s
sort of in the middle, it seems kind of balanced, people said it seemed the
most small &quot;r&quot; republican, meaning sort of virtuous and
straightforward and uncorrupted. So it&#39;s not as though these issues die out
when we get states and a country. But now southerners might disagree and might
say, &#39;No. Pennsylvania is of course not the most republican. We in the South
are the most republican, the most virtuous of all regions.&#39; Of course, other
colonists from other regions would have disagreed and would have claimed, as
many did, that the South was aristocratic in the extreme, that they had a true
haughty aristocratic elite, plantation owners and then a glut of poor common
folk. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly--this
is not going to be a surprise to anyone--southern society was structured around
widely-scattered plantations which essentially functioned like small villages
owned and controlled by southern gentlemen. And it was these gentlemen who
controlled and regulated affairs, who did things like take responsibility for
fixing roads or tending to local affairs, rather than having some kind of
formal institution tending to those things, as might have happened in a place
that was more structured--institutionally structured--like New England. And
these southern gentlemen really did enjoy great display in their homes, in
their clothing, in their style of living. They spent their leisure time
gambling, cock fighting, horse racing and, as that diarist suggests, drinking. </p>
<p>Now generally
speaking, education was not as important in the South as in the North, which is
not to say gentlemen were [correction: weren&#39;t] expected to be educated. They
were in the South, but going to school at William and Mary was sometimes more
social training than intellectual training. I&#39;m sorry, William and Mary. I do
not mean to insult you. But for one, Thomas Jefferson was really not impressed
with his education at William and Mary, and ultimately, he created in his old
age the University of Virginia because he wanted to create what he considered
to be a better academic institution in the state of Virginia where people would
be truly learning. This will be a temple of learning, the University of
Virginia. </p>
<p>Okay. Things didn&#39;t
work out the way he planned initially at the University of Virginia. There was
a lot of drinking, a lot of gambling. I think--I can&#39;t remember whether Edgar
Allan Poe was thrown out for drinking or gambling or both but he was expelled
from the University of Virginia for doing one or both of those two things.
Students really liked, at UVA--I don&#39;t know if any of you have been there, but there
is sort of this beautiful lawn at the center of campus--students really liked
to ride up and down the lawn on their horses and shoot guns off in the air.
This was a popular hobby. </p>
<p>Things got really bad
apparently with the guns and the horses, so Thomas Jefferson in 1825 called a
meeting of the faculty and students so that he could reprimand them. This is
the hobby and delight of his old age, his--what he&#39;s going to give to his own
colony or state of Virginia, and now just wacky people riding around shooting
guns and not really going to class, per se. So he calls this meeting of
students and faculty and he invites along James Monroe and James Madison. Okay.
So we&#39;ve got three ex-Presidents who are standing over the Virginia student
body who are going to reprimand them for shooting off their guns. And
supposedly--I always find this sort of touching. Right? Supposedly, Thomas
Jefferson stood up to yell at the students but he was so upset at what was
happening at the university that he started to cry and he had to sit down. [laughter]
So okay, crying Founders. So he was very upset and then one of the Jameses--I
don&#39;t know if it was Madison or Monroe--sort of had to take over. </p>
<p>Now you would think
that a crying Founder might help the student body at Virginia to kind of shape
up, but it did not. And years later when faculty told the still-rioting, gun-shooting
students that they needed to actually give up their guns now because they
apparently just didn&#39;t want to stop shooting them, there was some kind of a gun
riot, [laughter] a riot, like crashing windows and--I don&#39;t know the details
but it was ugly, and seventy students were expelled. Four years after the
amazing gun riot, when students were celebrating the anniversary of the gun
riot, [laughter] which kind of tells you that people being expelled really
didn&#39;t do a lot for--[laughter] This gets really unfortunate. They were
celebrating the anniversary of the gun riot and a professor was accidentally
shot and killed. [laughter] So, [laughter] it&#39;s a problem. It&#39;s UVA, the
early years. Right? It&#39;s a problem--unfortunate problem with the guns. Okay. [laughs]
Virginia education in the early years.</p>
<p>So, as with the other
regions, southern colonists--colonies--were distinctive in many ways other than
crazy, gun-toting students. Of course, slavery had an enormous impact on the
tone of life in the South. There were between 1.3 and 1.7 white Europeans to
every slave in the South and in some colonies like South Carolina there
actually was a black majority. To Jefferson, slavery corrupted the morals of
the South, and once again, he says this in <i>Notes on the State of Virginia </i>to
his French audience, so he certainly writes things there that he would not have
said to a fellow Virginian. And in this case this is what he writes in <i>Notes:
</i></p>
<p>&quot;There must
doubtless be an unhappy influence on the manners of our people produced by the
existence of slavery among us. The whole commerce between master and slave is a
perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions, the most unremitting
deposition on the one part and degrading submissions on the other. Our children
see this and learn to imitate it for man is an imitative animal. The parent
storms, the child looks on, puts on the same airs in the circle of smaller
slaves, gives a loose to his worst of passions, and thus nursed, educated and
daily exercised in tyranny cannot but be stamped by it with odious
peculiarities. The man must be a prodigy who can retain his manners and morals
undepraved by such circumstances.&quot; </p>
<p>So that&#39;s Jefferson, <i>Notes
on the State of Virginia, </i>in a really strong passage about the influence of
slavery on the morals and manners of southerners. So clearly the South is based
on the mastery, literally and figuratively, of a ruling elite. And it&#39;s this
spirit of entitlement and independence and mastery that would inspire some of
the emotional response in the South to Britain&#39;s actions in the 1760s and 1770s,
particularly in Virginia, which was the colony that really believed itself to
be at the top of the hierarchy of southern colonies, the leader of the South.
The response of Virginia to what they perceived to be the impingement of
Britain upon their rights was second in intensity, as we&#39;re going to see, only
to what took place in Massachusetts and particularly in Boston. </p>
<p>So you can now begin
to see how really diverse these different regions and colonies were and you can
also begin to see why when different men from different regions came together
in something like ultimately a continental congress they were pretty quick to
pick up on those differences. And New Englanders picked apart the southerners
as being arrogant and wearing flashy clothes and southerners thought the New
Englanders were strange and awkward and everybody distrusted the New Yorkers
and everybody smiled at the Pennsylvanians, but all of these [laughter] things
were pretty prominent in any kind of a continental organization. </p>
<p>So with all of these
big differences you can begin to see how truly amazing and noteworthy would
have been any attempts at colonial unity. And what I&#39;m going to do right now is
just talk very briefly about these three attempts at colonial unity that I
mentioned at the outset of the lecture. Two of them, as we&#39;ll see, were
inspired by the colonies as a means of self-defense. One of them was basically
created by the British, not surprisingly as a means of asserting British
control. But what&#39;s really most important to note in these examples that I&#39;m
going to offer you here is: generally speaking, when American colonists
considered colonial union on their own it was for reasons of self-defense. It
was for reasons of self-interest and not because of some greater ideological
calling; it was really for basic self-defense. </p>
<p>So let&#39;s look at the
first attempt at colonial union, which took place in 1643. Okay. So in 1643,
representatives of the colonies of Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut,
and New Haven -- New Haven is its own little settlement. I--It happens several
times in this course that New Haven just appears all by itself, which I always
kind of love because you just don&#39;t expect it to sort of sit there all by
itself having historical prominence, but here it is. So Massachusetts Bay,
Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven decided that they wanted to form a
confederation to defend themselves against Dutch expansion and hostile Indian
tribes, and to create some kind of forum for resolving intercolonial disputes,
which happened all the time. Rhode Island tried to join the forum [laughs] but
it was excluded [laughter] because nobody trusted Rhode Island [laughter] so
they were not invited to join. The union, known as the United Colonies of New
England, or the New England Confederation, didn&#39;t have any sanction in the
charters of its member colonies. Instead it was just a kind of joint advisory
council and it was made up of two members from each participating colony, so
basically it had eight people in it, right? And six of the eight had to vote
for something for it to take effect. So between 1643 and 1664, the United
Colonies of New England, or the New England Confederation, met--between those
years, 1643 and 1664--until Connecticut annexed New Haven and the number of
members decreased and went down to six and this became a problem. So after 1664,
when New Haven sort of merged with Connecticut, it didn&#39;t meet very often and
then ultimately in 1684 it kind of drifted to an end, the end of the United
Colonies of New England. So that&#39;s amazing first attempt at union. It was an
attempt. </p>
<p>The second union of a
sort was spurred by the British government, which in the 1680s became worried
that the New England colonies were not sympathetic and loyal to the British
monarch and we&#39;re--basically we&#39;re creeping up here on--I&#39;m not going to go
into it in any detail but--on what comes to be known as the Glorious Revolution,
when the monarchy falls, so there&#39;s a reason why they&#39;re wondering how loyal
the New Englanders are to the monarchy. But British authorities wanted to be
sure that the New England colonies were going to be loyal to the British monarch.
</p>
<p>So in 1686, the
British government formed what they called the Dominion of New England, which
to me sounds like sort of Darth Vader, &quot;Star Wars&quot;--the &quot;Dominion.&quot; So
they formed the Dominion of New England, 1686, which fused all of the New
England colonies plus New York plus New Jersey into one colony to be ruled by
one royal governor and an appointed council. That&#39;s a dramatic gesture. The
resulting mass that was made by merging all of that into one colony was larger
in size than England. Okay. That&#39;s a lot of land, a lot of land. The newly-installed
royal governor was named Edmund Andros, A-n-d-r-o-s. </p>
<p>Andros ruled over the
Dominion without a legislature, passing laws after they were approved by a
majority of his councilors. You can see how happy this is going to make the New
Englanders. Not surprisingly, a lot of New Englanders resented the dominion and
the way it just sort of supplanted colonial legislatures. Even more
unfortunate, Andros was not a very diplomatic politician and he really had no
reason to be diplomatic. He was sent to New England on royal authority, his job
was to assert royal authority, so he really didn&#39;t need to please anybody
except the King. Even so, he somehow seemed intent on really proving his
authority by flaunting it before New Englanders. So for example, not long after
he arrived, Andros took over a Puritan meeting house and converted it into an
Anglican church. Right? Nothing like a little &#39;ha, you Puritans, you think you
control the Dominion, but I control the Dominion,&#39; dramatic gesture. He also
put the colonial militia under the direct control of the governor himself. And
there were a number of other highly unpopular things that he did. But in 1689
when the Stuart monarchy fell in England because of the Glorious Revolution,
American colonists also revolted and they toppled the Dominion government; they
jailed its officers including Andros, who supposedly tried to escape in women&#39;s
clothing. [laughter] Okay. So that&#39;s somewhat humiliating. Even more
humiliating, he was caught, [laughs] poor Andros, and he is eventually freed
and not surprisingly fled right back to England. And soon after, Britain just
let the colonies resume their former status so end of the Dominion of New
England. That&#39;s a really obviously whopping big success. </p>
<p>The third and last
attempt at union is in 1754, and like the first one, it was largely because of
a threat. And this time, colonies were afraid of threats coming from the French
and from Indians. And here we have the not really promising entry of George
Washington on to the colonial military scene. I&#39;m going to draw a little
picture to you of George Washington&#39;s moment of glory at this moment in time.
Okay. So in 1753, 1754, there were some skirmishes on the Pennsylvania frontier
because French forces were moving south from Quebec. And Virginia militia under
the command of George Washington--a young and, as we will hear, inexperienced
officer--he&#39;s sent out by the governor of Virginia to investigate and see
what&#39;s happening with these sort of French movements on the frontier. So
Washington and his men apparently tramp around the frontier for a while and
ultimately they find a small party of French soldiers in an encampment and they
open fire on them and kill a lot of them, and then discover unfortunately after
the fact that actually it was a neutral ambassador holding papers for a
negotiation, and his diplomatic escort. Okay. [laughter] So Washington just
killed a bunch of diplomats and their escort and the diplomat literally died
clutching papers to negotiate Okay. [laughter] Thank you, George Washington. </p>
<p>So Washington, after
this glorious moment, decides he&#39;s going to pull back and he&#39;s going to encamp
his troops in a fort that he will have built. Right? So he has troops build a
fort and he names it Fort Necessity, which it really was. Right? He just killed
people he shouldn&#39;t have been killing; now he&#39;d better create a fort, so he
creates Fort Necessity, but unfortunately for Washington he built it in--basically
in a valley. Okay, fort in valley, just not good. He didn&#39;t really think very
hard about the places up above the fort where the French could perch and fire
down in to the fort, which of course they did. Right? [laughter] He also
didn&#39;t think about the fact that if it&#39;s in a valley if it rains, it&#39;s really
bad for people in the valley. So sure enough the French attack, there is a big
rain storm, the French are shooting down from the heights, and Washington and
his little troop are down in this sort of soggy, increasingly puddled fort in which
their powder is all getting soaked in these huge puddles as it continues to
rain. This did not end well for Washington and basically he ultimately had to
surrender. </p>
<p>Not only did he have
to surrender, but because of a document that was really badly translated, he
signed his name to terms of surrender which announced that Washington had,
quote, &quot;assassinated&quot; a French diplomat. Yes, I assassinated a--This
was all bad. [laughter] This is just--This is George Washington&#39;s entry.
Right? Let&#39;s give the command to him. This is not a good moment for George. And
in addition to that, supposedly in this moment, Washington wrote a letter to
his brother. He was still kind of cheery about this whole thing, throughout
this whole thing. He wrote a letter to his brother and he said--I have to quote
it precisely here--&quot;I heard bullets whistle and, believe me, there was
something charming in the sound.&quot; Right? He&#39;s so excited about getting a
chance to fight. It&#39;s like--the charming sound of bullets. Supposedly, that quote
made its way back to King George the Second, who thought it was a really
stupidly ridiculous thing for anybody to say, and I think what the king said
was something along the lines of: &#39;He wouldn&#39;t think so if he heard very many
of those bullets whistling. They would not be charming anymore.&#39; </p>
<p>So, not a good moment
for George. He&#39;s not helping matters, but in addition to that the British
really were worried that Indian relations generally speaking were deteriorating
largely due to complications between colonies that weren&#39;t cooperating with
each other. So the governors of Massachusetts and New York persuade the British
Lords of Trade--they&#39;re the guys who regulate trade in the colonies--to issue a
call for a conference to meet in Albany in June of 1754 to negotiate with the Six
Nations, with the Iroquois Confederation, and to talk about other ways of
coordinating defense for the colonies. </p>
<p>So in 1754, there is
this meeting called to figure out a way for the colonies to jointly work things
out with the Native Americans, the Six Nations. Invitations went to nine
colonies: Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Virginia, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. I&#39;ll repeat that one more
time: Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Virginia, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. North Carolina, South
Carolina, and Georgia were not included because they were probably just too far
away from where people thought there was going to be conflict. New Jersey and
Virginia declined because it was too expensive to go. So even here when you--people
are afraid, there&#39;s an Indian threat--some colonies just say, &#39;Oh, it costs too
much. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to bother.&#39; </p>
<p>But this meeting--I&#39;ll
end here and I&#39;ll pick up with this little end passage on Tuesday. This meeting
came to be known as the Albany Congress--the Albany Congress in 1754. And
I&#39;ll talk briefly on Tuesday about the Albany Congress and what it was and what
it did, and then I&#39;ll segue from that,--which also doesn&#39;t end well--in to the
Stamp Act. </p>
<p>Have a good weekend.
