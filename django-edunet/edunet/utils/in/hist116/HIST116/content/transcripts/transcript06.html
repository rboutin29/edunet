<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>Tuesday
we ended with the angry response in the colonies to the passage of the Stamp
Act, 1765. I talked about--I described Patrick Henry. We had a first--our famous
Revolution moment number one, Patrick Henry speaking out in the Virginia House
of Burgesses, talking about what he dramatically called his colony&#39;s dying
liberty, and at the very end of the lecture I mentioned that in May of 1765,
the Virginia House of Burgesses passed some protesting resolutions ultimately
known as the Virginia Resolves. I think I said Resolutions on Tuesday and let&#39;s
stick with Resolves, the Virginia Resolves. </p>
<p>And the Virginia
Resolves said--There were a number of different --obviously--resolves in the
Virginia Resolves. They said that the colonists had come to Virginia with equal
rights to all British subjects; that the colonial charter confirmed that; that
Virginians had the right to be governed by their own legislature; and that the
Virginia legislature had never forfeited its right to impose taxes on the
colony of Virginia. I&#39;ll repeat that again. The Virginia Resolves, May 1765:
colonists had come to Virginia with equal rights to all British subjects;
colonial charters confirmed that; Virginians had the right to be governed by
their own colonial legislature; and the Virginia colonial legislature had not
forfeited its right to impose taxes on the colony of Virginia. </p>
<p>Now the House of
Burgesses passes these resolutions, but in Virginia they weren&#39;t even published
in the local newspaper. However, they were published in Rhode Island. Okay. I
really don&#39;t make this up. I feel like you&#39;re going to accuse me of planting
Rhode Island randomly throughout this course and I&#39;m not. It&#39;s--Really it&#39;s
there all by itself. Rhode Island--and why Rhode Island I can&#39;t tell you--but
indeed by happenstance, someone in Rhode Island--It circulates. The resolves
are circulating. People are reading them and they&#39;re talking about them, but
it&#39;s somebody in Rhode Island who publishes the Virginia Resolves in a Rhode
Island newspaper. </p>
<p>However, what this
person does when he publishes these resolves is not only publish the ones that
were actually passed, but there are two additional resolves that get published
right alongside the ones that were passed. These were not passed and possibly
weren&#39;t really even discussed, and they&#39;re more radical than the other
resolutions. But they&#39;re put right alongside with no differentiation, and these
two unpassed more radical resolutions say, quote, &quot;His Majesty&#39;s liege
people, inhabitants of this colony, are not bound to yield obedience to any law
or ordinance whatsoever designed to impose any taxation upon them.&quot; Okay.
That&#39;s a much bolder statement than what I just said was happening in those
Virginia Resolves. And then the sort of more radical unpassed resolution
number two that got published said, that anyone who asserted that anyone except
the Virginia Assembly could directly tax Virginia was, quote, &quot;an enemy of
this, His Majesty&#39;s colony.&quot; </p>
<p>Okay. Those are two
really strong statements. The Virginia House of Burgesses did not pass those,
did not resolve those, but they get published in Rhode Island right alongside
the ones that were passed and resolved, and so they go circulating throughout
the colonies, making Virginia look a lot more radical than it was at that
particular moment. So news of this sort of new radical version of the Virginia
Resolves gets spread throughout the colonies and colonies are then inspired to
pass resolves of their own. So it&#39;s another Rhode Island moment. </p>
<p>However, it is
Massachusetts that first suggests united colonial action. So in June of 1765,
the Massachusetts assembly sends a circular letter to all of the colonial
assemblies--and a circular letter is kind of what it sounds like, a letter
intended to circulate--to all of the colonial assemblies inviting them to meet
in a congress in New York in October of 1765, quote, &quot;to consider of a
general and united, dutiful, loyal and humble representation of their condition
to His Majesty and the parliament and to implore relief.&quot; Okay. So it&#39;s a
united response but it&#39;s also dutiful, loyal and humble, so on the one hand the
fact that there&#39;s going to be some kind of a united colonial statement is interesting
and forceful, but on the other hand, dutiful, loyal, humble. We&#39;re not -- we&#39;re
not here declaring independence here. We&#39;re just kind of imploring relief,
making a statement that, &#39;Excuse us: we are your humble and obedient subjects
and we don&#39;t really like this; thank you very much.&#39; So it&#39;s that kind of a
statement. </p>
<p>Nine colonies
responded. New Hampshire declined to participate. Virginia, North Carolina and
Georgia couldn&#39;t participate because their governors didn&#39;t convene their
assemblies to elect delegates, so there were no delegates elected, but all in
all there were twenty-seven men who took part in what came to be known as the
Stamp Act Congress. Right? Easy enough to remember, the Stamp Act Congress,
which met for much of October in 1765. Okay, the Stamp Act Congress. </p>
<p>The Stamp Act
Congress was actually the first of what we&#39;re going to see is a series of
extralegal organizations created outside of the regular colonial political
system to resist and reform British policies --and so it&#39;s a significant action
on the part of the colonies. And ultimately, the Stamp Act Congress passed a
series of declarations, and they kind of echo some of the resolutions and
declarations that had been circulating and they&#39;re going to sound not
drastically different from some of the logic that I&#39;ve been talking about in
the last lecture or two. And I&#39;ll just mention four of the resolutions passed
by the Stamp Act Congress. They declared that they owed their allegiance to the
crown like any British subject; they declared that they were entitled to the
rights and liberties of any British subject; they said that British subjects in
the colonies could not be taxed without their consent; and they declared that
trial by jury was the right of every British subject in the colonies. So you
can see their--really their statement is saying well, we&#39;re British subjects
like any other British subject and we&#39;re demanding the rights and liberties of
other British subjects. </p>
<p>Now it&#39;s important to
note--the resolutions are not saying that Parliament had no right to regulate
trade in the colonies. They&#39;re just saying that Parliament cannot directly tax
the colonies without their consent. So again, it&#39;s a direct statement, it&#39;s a
strong statement, but it&#39;s a respectful statement and it&#39;s not boldly sort of
altering--at least in the minds of the colonists--an enormous change of policy.
They&#39;re kind of stating what they think the state of things is. So clearly the
Stamp Act Congress is a step toward colonial unity; it&#39;s a significant step. </p>
<p>Now actually I want
to add at this point the answer to a question that someone asked at the end of
class on Tuesday, and he&#39;s lurking over there. I think that was you -- yes. [inaudible]
It was a really good question. I answer questions--and then I actually answer
them in class. It was a really good question, and the question was did anyone
in Parliament actually oppose the Stamp Act and if they did what was the
logic? It&#39;s actually a really good question and although I knew the answer was
yes, I couldn&#39;t tell you very much detail about that yes, so I went and did a
little research and it&#39;s interesting. Most members of Parliament assumed that
the Stamp Act was, I suppose you could say constitutional, or that it was above-board,
proper, that there was nothing wrong with it as far as procedurally--and most
members of Parliament assumed that the colonists would agree it&#39;s
constitutional--above-board--there&#39;s nothing wrong with it as far as the fact
that it exists; the Stamp Act is perfectly proper. </p>
<p>Some members of Parliament,
and not a lot but some, did admit that maybe Parliament was treading on
dangerous ground, but even these people didn&#39;t worry about the Stamp Act on
constitutional grounds. They didn&#39;t say, &#39;Wow. I wonder if we have the right to
do this.&#39; Rather, they worried that maybe the colonists were going to be
unhappy because the Stamp Act maybe would seem too burdensome. Or they worried
that maybe the colonists would think this was some kind of an aggressive
display of parliamentary power, but members of Parliament were actually not
worried about this seeming as though it&#39;s something that wasn&#39;t proper, wasn&#39;t
allowable, wasn&#39;t supposed to be done within the confines of the British
imperial system. </p>
<p>So basically what
you&#39;re seeing here is sort of a version of what I&#39;ve been saying in a variety
of different ways so far in this course. I&#39;ve been talking about different
mindsets developing, and both sides sort of not necessarily understanding that
there are different mindsets evolving here. What you&#39;re seeing here is
basically members of Parliament just fundamentally not seeing that the
colonists had developed a different understanding of the workings of the
British imperial system, and those members who were worried about the act, they
were worried about it being unpopular or maybe seeming too strong but they were
not worried about any larger sort of legal rationale. As one member put it,--I
thought this was kind of a neat quote--&quot;We are working in the dark and the
less we do the better.&quot; I thought that&#39;s a great quote, because it&#39;s
basically a Member of Parliament saying, &#39;I&#39;m not entirely sure. We don&#39;t
really know what we&#39;re doing, and we don&#39;t really know how they&#39;re going to
respond, so we actually need to be careful with what we&#39;re doing because we just
don&#39;t know what the response is going to be. They&#39;re not--They may not like it.&#39;
There actually was only one Member of Parliament who was a planter in the West
Indies, one guy who predicted, &#39;I think this Stamp Act is going to produce
discord and confusion in the colonies.&#39; Right? One guy, so probably afterwards
he was the guy saying, &#39;Yeah. I told you.&#39; [laughs] &#39;You should have listened
to me. I told you. I knew.&#39; Okay. So that&#39;s the answer to that question. It&#39;s
a really good question because I had just never looked that up in any detail
before. Okay. </p>
<p>So--So far we&#39;ve
largely been talking about speechifying, paper-pushing, resolves, declarations,
newspaper announcements, but in Boston we&#39;re now about to see some physical
resistance. Because there, some radicals decided no more words--action. And
these Boston radicals, as you&#39;re about to see, they deployed a long-held
colonial tradition of resistance. They basically planned a mob action. Now it&#39;s
important to note that mobs in early America weren&#39;t sort of wild, violent,
out-of-control, &#39;oh, my gosh, it&#39;s a riot&#39; kind of actions. In a way they were
sort of part of the political system, something that people were supposed to do
when they felt outraged. </p>
<p>It was sort of a way
of venting popular protest, and usually early American mobs were pretty
conservative. They were usually focused on protecting the good of the community
from things like unfairly high food prices or illegal business practices.
Normally, they weren&#39;t really excited about tearing things down. Normally, they
involved some marching and some yelling, there was a lot of effigy-burning, and
then people went home. So early American mobs again are almost kind of
procedural. They&#39;re sort of what happens when you&#39;re upset and you&#39;re a member
of the public, and it&#39;s not only sort of average members of the public--it&#39;s
not only the masses taking part in these kinds of protests. All levels of
society might take part at one time or another. </p>
<p>So in the summer of
1765, some Bostonians decided they&#39;re going to take advantage of this tradition.
A group of Boston radicals who eventually called themselves the Sons of
Liberty, so here&#39;s yet another--Now we&#39;re starting to get to the part of the
course where these things come out of my mouth and you&#39;re like &#39;ding, ding,
ding, ding, Revolutionary War moments, Sons of Liberty,&#39; and [inaudible] we&#39;re
going to have another one by the end of the lecture today but here&#39;s one: Sons
of Liberty, Boston. So these radicals decide they&#39;re going to take action. And
the Sons of Liberty basically are artisans and shopkeepers who want to act in
resistance to the Stamp Act. Samuel Adams--who&#39;s really more a member of the
elite, but he nevertheless was kind of a champion of the artisan class--and
he&#39;s among their number too. </p>
<p>So let&#39;s look for a
moment at what the Sons of Liberty decide to do and how it works out. Okay. So
basically, in Boston at the time there were two really large fraternal
organizations of artisans. There was one in the north end of Boston, there was
one in the south end of Boston. And the Sons of Liberty think--well, we have
these sort of organized groups like clubs of artisans. Why don&#39;t we enlist the
aid of one of them? They&#39;re sort of already organized. They already have a
leader. Maybe we could get them to help us in some sort of organized protest
against the Stamp Act. So they appeal to the south end group, who agrees to
take part in some kind of a protest. </p>
<p>So now we have this
radical group, the Sons of Liberty, who have named themselves, so they&#39;re organized
enough to have names. We have an organized force of men. And we have a
focused desire to protest against an act of Parliament. So this is on its way
to being a different kind of early American mob action than these other ones
might have been. Okay. </p>
<p>So in Boston the poor
guy who was the stamp agent, the stamp distributor, is named Andrew Oliver.
This is the person you do not want to be at this particular moment. Okay. So
Andrew Oliver is the one who&#39;s going to be giving out or selling the stamps. So
obviously this group of men, they want to do a mob action, and they decide
okay, Oliver is the target. So first they go to his dockside warehouse. They
assume actually that that&#39;s where the stamped paper is going to be, so they
just destroy the warehouse -- I mean, like, destroy it. Then they go to Oliver&#39;s
house and throw rocks and basically break all of the windows. Then they take an
effigy of Oliver and they stamp on it. Okay. That&#39;s not my pun. That&#39;s actually
their pun--right? The Stamp Act--we&#39;re stamping on Oliver--those wacky early
Americans with their wild sense of humor. Bad puns of early America. That&#39;s
the first of this course. So they stamp on Andrew Oliver. Oliver responds
logically enough by resigning as stamp distributor, [laughs] which I think was
a wise move. Okay. &#39;You think that? Thank you very much. I&#39;m going home to my
broken-window house now.&#39; [laughs] &#39;No more stamps for me.&#39; </p>
<p>Okay. Not long after
that, maybe within two weeks, that same group of men turn on Lieutenant
Governor Thomas Hutchinson, who seemed like a friend to the Stamp Act. This
time the mob goes to his house and they destroy it, and I don&#39;t just mean rocks
at windows. They go to Hutchinson&#39;s house, they smash the windows, they break
in the doors, they smash the furniture, they cut the paintings, they trash the
clothing, they cut down the trees in his garden, and they&#39;re in the process of
removing the roof [laughter] when daylight stops them. Okay. So this is--On the
one hand it&#39;s sort of a weird mob. They&#39;re like, &#39;excuse me. Can you pass me
that hammer? I&#39;ve got to remove this shingle.&#39; They&#39;re really-- [laughs]--They&#39;re
an industrious mob action, but they&#39;re literally completely tearing apart
Hutchinson&#39;s pretty sort of spiffy mansion in protest. Attacks on stamp distributors
in other colonies followed and there were lots of resignations of stamp agents.
Right? &#39;I&#39;m not doing the job. [laughs] Thanks. I love my house. I don&#39;t want
to do this anymore.&#39; </p>
<p>So the result of all
of this kind of action is that by November of 1765, when the Stamp Act is
actually going to go into effect--So first of all, the act actually hasn&#39;t gone
into effect yet. Everything I&#39;ve talked about is leading up to it actually
going into effect. So November of 1765, it&#39;s due to go into effect but people
aren&#39;t quite sure what to do. Do we ignore it? Are there actually any stamp
agents left? [laughs] Maybe we don&#39;t have to ignore it because nobody will
sell stamped paper. I don&#39;t know. </p>
<p>And some people did
just choose to ignore the act. Others went further and decided to boycott
British goods which, as we&#39;re going to see further into this course, was
sometimes a really effective way to protest against the mother country--basically,
hit economically and that&#39;s bound to make an impact. But in the middle of all
this, Grenville&#39;s ministry fell, not because of the Stamp Act but because of
insider politics. The colonists saw this as providential. Grenville&#39;s gone.
Clearly it&#39;s a sign from providence that we are meant to succeed here, to come
out of this looking better than things were when we were in the middle of it. </p>
<p>The new prime
minister is the Earl of Rockingham. Now the Earl of Rockingham had strong
connections with London merchants. London merchants clearly are people who are
going to be deeply affected by colonial boycotting, so they want the Stamp Act
repealed. So we&#39;ve got this new Prime Minister, the Earl of Rockingham; he&#39;s in
with the merchants who are being hurt by the boycott. The idea now is--it would
be a fine thing if we could figure out a way to repeal the Stamp Act, but the
problem of course is figuring out how to repeal it without seeming weak, while
holding your ground. </p>
<p>And Rockingham
eventually did repeal the Stamp Act in March of 1766, but to save face he
assigned blame to the wounded British economy. He did not say anything about
colonial rights. He said, &#39;Well, the economy is suffering and so we will repeal
the Stamp Act.&#39; He also passed at the same time the Declaratory Act--the
Declaratory Act--which declared in short that Parliament could pass laws for
the colonies, quote, &quot;in all cases whatsoever.&quot; Okay, the
Declaratory Act of 1766, really strong statement. It&#39;s like, &#39;yeah, we&#39;re going
to repeal the Stamp Act but we&#39;re going to pass this other act that says no, we
can basically pass laws for you however we want to pass them. So we&#39;re not
caving; we&#39;re just sort of giving in on this one little point.&#39; </p>
<p>Now to Britain, the
Declaratory Act asserted their control over the colonies, their legal control
over the colonies in all cases. To the colonists, because it mentioned
legislation but not taxes, it seemed to suggest that maybe they had made their
point, that Parliament is not going to assert taxation. So in a way the
Declaratory Act makes things worse. It worsens ongoing misunderstandings
between Parliament and the colonies--the British not fully understanding the
colonial mindset about the workings of the empire, the colonists not viewing
their own logic as exceptional in any way. They assume that their logic has
been understood. </p>
<p>The Declaratory Act
also didn&#39;t really encourage compromise, because if you think about it,
moderates on all sides were discredited. In England, the Declaratory Act
asserted Parliamentary power, so it&#39;s a strong statement of power. In the
colonies, radicals ruled the day, because it seemed as though they&#39;d made their
point. So as far as the colonies were concerned, the Stamp Act crisis moved
many to accept radical leadership; it appears to be working. It also revealed
to the colonies the power of uniting the colonies to bring pressure against
England, which also seemed to have worked. </p>
<p>Now once again in the
middle of all this, the Prime Minister yet again is replaced. Clearly, this is
not the time to be a Prime Minister in England. It&#39;s kind of a rocky time going
on. So--Rocky time was not meant to be a pun. The Earl of Rockingham goes down
in this rocky time and Charles--I heard a groan. I didn&#39;t do it on purpose. It
just sort of happened. I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s a bad pun that I take full
responsibility for. But the Earl of Rockingham--His ministry falls. Charles
Townshend takes his place. Charles Townshend, the new Prime Minister--and he&#39;s
given the task of balancing the budget in 1767. </p>
<p>And like Grenville
before him, Townshend first looks to England itself and issues new taxes in
England, but again he still needs more income and he does next turn to the
colonies, and he devises a scheme that he thinks isn&#39;t going to be too
upsetting to these sort of touchy colonials. He says he&#39;s going to proceed,
quote, &quot;with great delicacy,&quot; right? Because it&#39;s clear now, &#39;they
get upset over there; they get upset. We need to be careful, I&#39;m going to
proceed with great delicacy.&#39; He understands their sensitivity about this whole
issue of taxation. So he decides he&#39;s going to ask for customs duties on items
that the colonies import from Britain, like glass, silk, paper, paint and--tea.
[laughs] You can see where we&#39;re going. But this is not an internal tax. This
is an external tax. It&#39;s not a tax on things within the colonies. It&#39;s not a
tax on legal documents. It&#39;s not a tax on playing cards like the Stamp Act.
It&#39;s an external tax. It&#39;s customs duties. And like before, Townshend wants the
money raised by this to go to pay for royal administration in the colonies, so
also the money raised isn&#39;t going back to England; it&#39;s going to be spent on
the colonies. </p>
<p>Townshend also
reorganized the customs service in the colonies, basically tossing out old
customs agents who had been bought by colonial merchants and putting
hand-picked men in their place. So all in all, Townshend thought--surely these
are tame enough measures that the colonists aren&#39;t going to object to them.
Right? This seems as though they&#39;re accommodating, they&#39;re mild, nothing very
dramatic is being done here. These come to be known as the Townshend Acts of
1767. </p>
<p>And sure enough, the
initial response to the Townshend Acts is relatively weak. But, colonial anger
is raised yet again by a publication by a colonist named John Dickinson. He&#39;s a
Pennsylvanian. He&#39;s in Pennsylvania and he writes a series of letters. First
they appear in a Pennsylvania newspaper. They&#39;re eventually published in other
colonial newspapers, and then finally they&#39;re put together and published in a
pamphlet. This is all in 1767--and the pamphlet is named <i>Letters from a
Farmer in Pennsylvania to the Inhabitants of the British Colonies.</i> They
had very literal titles in these days; this is one of them. John Dickinson,
Pennsylvanian, <i>Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania to the Inhabitants of
the British Colonies</i>. </p>
<p>Now Dickinson
actually--When you read these, he&#39;s pretty moderate in tone. And most of what
he does is he uses past precedent to argue against the right of Parliament to
directly tax the colonies. He asserts directly: we&#39;re not talking about independence;
we&#39;re just talking about past precedent. However, he also says, and this is a
quote from him, &quot;We cannot be happy without being free. We cannot be free
without being secure in our property. We cannot be secure in our property, if
without our consent, others may, as by right, take it away, that taxes imposed
on us by Parliament, do thus take it away.&quot; That&#39;s really clear, direct
logic. Right? We can&#39;t be happy without being free. We can&#39;t be free without
being secure in our property. We can&#39;t be secure in our property if without
our consent, others may take it away, and Parliament seems to be taking it
away. </p>
<p>So Dickinson isn&#39;t
arguing anything amazingly new here, but he&#39;s certainly stating it with real
clarity and real power. And he also appears to be saying, &#39;Well, some of that
stuff we learned from that whole Stamp Act thing? I think they apply as well to
this new Townshend Act thing.&#39; He appears to be drawing a pattern. So <i>Letters
from a Farmer in Pennsylvania </i>ultimately has an impact. It&#39;s a strong
statement. </p>
<p>Up in Boston, there
was also some writing going on. And there, Samuel Adams, who was in the
Massachusetts assembly, wrote a circular letter that he sent to other colonies.
Yet again, another circular letter, and this time it&#39;s a circular letter
protesting against the Townshend Acts and it&#39;s moderate, but it&#39;s criticizing
the acts. It does deny--It&#39;s--We&#39;re -- &#39;This isn&#39;t about independence, we&#39;re not
trying to rebel here&#39;--but it does urge joint colonial resistance to the
Townshend Acts. </p>
<p>Now back in England,
many people urged a lenient response to this. If you think about it,
potentially, it&#39;s a scary thing. You have this guy--this radical guy in Boston--who&#39;s
urging joint colonial resistance to an act of Parliament. So as you will see,
some people get rather upset by this, but not everybody. Some people say, &#39;Well,
okay. Let&#39;s not over-respond; let&#39;s not overreact.&#39; However, the British
Secretary of State, Lord Hillsborough, really saw this as organized resistance
and refused to stand for it. So in 1768, privately consulting with the King, so
kind of doing this off on the side, he instructed the Governor of Massachusetts
to dissolve the Massachusetts assembly unless they took back the letter. He
also sent a letter to all royal governors telling them to ignore the
Massachusetts letter or else he would dissolve their legislatures too. Okay.
That&#39;s--There&#39;s a strong statement for you that&#39;s clearly bound to make
colonists get very, very upset. </p>
<p>Hillsborough also,
knowing that people are going to get upset, urged General Thomas Gage--who&#39;s
commander-in-chief of the army and at the time was posted in New York--he urges
Gage in New York to prepare his troops in case they&#39;re needed in Boston. Okay.
So he&#39;s anticipating there might be a response; it would be nice to have troops
potentially ready to go to Boston. So now, troops are being organized, there&#39;s
threats about dissolving assemblies, and communication between the colonies in
the form of a circular letter is being discouraged. </p>
<p>So clearly, if you&#39;re
a colonist at this point, there appears to be a plan of repression, right? A plan.
There seems to be a system of tyranny. There seems to be some kind of organized
attack on colonial liberties, and I&#39;m emphasizing plan and system and organized
because next week that&#39;s the direction we&#39;re going to be going with the
lectures. We&#39;re going to be looking at what I call the logic of resistance, or--how
does all of this add up in the minds of the colonists? What&#39;s--what are they
drawing--what conclusions are they drawing based on actions that are happening?
And as we&#39;ll see in the lectures and in the readings for next week, there&#39;s a
lot of conclusions being drawn about an actual system of tyranny, which is a
very eighteenth-century way of kind of looking at it. </p>
<p>So colonists are
wondering if there&#39;s a sort of system of repression being put in place.
Meanwhile, Parliament, eventually, in 1770, repeals most of the Townshend Acts
but does preserve the tax on tea, partly for revenue and partly to prove that
they still have the right to tax the colonies. So we&#39;re half-seeing revenue
raising and half-seeing an argument here. And probably there was an assumption
on the part of Parliament that by repealing most of the acts things would quiet
down, but as events in Boston were about to prove this would not be the case. </p>
<p>As we&#39;re about to
see, between 1768 and 1774, Boston really ends up taking center stage. And
thanks in part to the actions of Samuel Adams who really is--you&#39;ll see today--a
brilliant propagandist and a man with a really fierce sense of his rights--his
British rights and his grievances as an English subject. And I will add that
Samuel Adams did brew beer. Right? He actually is--Samuel Adams is associated
with beer, so truth in advertising, though I have no idea if that&#39;s an accurate
portrait of Sam Adams. </p>
<p><b>Student: </b>It&#39;s Paul Revere. Sam
Adams is too ugly. </p>
<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>Sam
Adams is too ugly. [laughs] Oh, poor Sam Adams. I feel very bad now. [laughs]
Oh. Well, he&#39;s not attractive but I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s ugly. I feel bad. Now
I&#39;m going to have to find a way to redeem Sam Adams in the-- [laughs]. Thank
you very much. No wonder I didn&#39;t think it was entirely an accurate portrait--Okay.
And yet he is associated with beer. Okay. So Sam Adams--He&#39;s going to have a
moment. </p>
<p>October of 1768,
troops actually arrive in Boston at the instigation of Massachusetts Royal
Governor Francis Bernard, who&#39;s alarmed at the sort of radical rumblings that
he&#39;s hearing. Parliament makes things worse by--in December of 1768--by
proposing that the ringleaders behind that circular letter that seems like
organized resistance, that they should be brought to trial for treason, and
using an obscure law, they say that they should be brought to trial for treason
in England; they should go trial in England. Okay. Again not something that&#39;s
going to make colonists really happy. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly,
when you have the next election for the assembly in Massachusetts in 1769, a
large number of radicals get voted in. And this new assembly passes, logically
enough, radical resolutions again largely the work of Samuel Adams, the sadly
not good-looking Samuel Adams, [laughter] who declared in these resolutions
that &quot;no man can be justly taxed by, or bound in conscience to obey, any law to
which he has not given his consent in person or by his representative.&quot; Okay.
That&#39;s a stronger statement than the ones we&#39;ve had before. What he&#39;s saying
here--Formally, like other colonial assemblies, the Massachusetts assembly was
saying, &#39;well, Parliament can legislate for us but they can&#39;t directly tax us
without our consent,&#39; but this statement says, &#39;Parliament can&#39;t legislate for
us if we have no say in the process.&#39; Bang. That&#39;s a very strong statement. </p>
<p>So clearly there&#39;s a
lot of emotion that has been raised about what the British administration is
doing. It&#39;s being vented in radical resolves like that. The arrival of troops
in Boston in 1768 ended up really focusing these feelings of grievance, these--this
anger, these sort of passions. You have troops being sent to Boston at a moment
where people are angry at the British; surely enough you can see that the
colonists are going to vent their feelings towards the soldiers. Troops being
sent to Boston increase colonial assumptions that they are being treated as
second-class citizens, as lower-class subjects, as people who are not equal to
other British subjects within the empire. </p>
<p>And Samuel Adams said
this really clearly in a newspaper article written at the time. He wrote:
&quot;It is well known from the first landing of the troops that the troops&#39;
behavior was to a great degree insolent and such as looked as if they really
believed that we were a country of rebels and that they were sent here to
subdue us.&quot; Right? Again Adams is propagandizing so he&#39;s always saying
things with a sort of extra twist, but what he&#39;s saying is, it was very clear
that when the troops arrived they were treating us like lowly rebels and that
they were sent here to subdue us. </p>
<p>Okay. So given all of
these feelings--fears about a tyrannical standing army that&#39;s inside a sort of
system of tyranny--it makes sense that when these troops arrive in Boston
relations are not going to be good between people in Boston and soldiers in
Boston, which brings us to yet another sort of bell-ringing Revolutionary War
moment, a particularly noteworthy active resistance in Boston later
memorialized by clever colonial propagandists as the Boston Massacre. Right?
That&#39;s how we know it today. They gave it--Colonists gave it that name. It&#39;s a
snappy name. Right? We kept the name. We like the name. It really has some
zing, makes a political point. </p>
<p>So let&#39;s look for a
minute here at the details of the Boston Massacre, partly because they&#39;re
really interesting as you&#39;ll see--it&#39;s just a really interesting incident--but
also because I think if you look at how the colonists and the soldiers were
interacting, it really will reveal something about the dynamic of
colonial-British relations at the time. </p>
<p>Now first off, it&#39;s
important to understand that the Boston Massacre wasn&#39;t this little isolated
moment of conflict between soldiers and citizens. Between 1768 and early 1770,
tensions were building between the colonists and the troops, and in early 1770
there actually were a number--several--different outbursts of hostility between
townspeople and soldiers in Boston. So an example: On March 2<sup>nd</sup>,
Samuel Grey, a rope maker, asked a passing soldier if he wanted a job, and when
the soldier, who was probably underpaid, said, &#39;Yeah, actually I could use a second
job,&#39; Grey laughed and said, &#39;Good. Go clean my outhouse.&#39; This did not make
the soldier happy, so the soldier slugged Grey, and Grey hit back, and other
people--soldiers ran out and other colonists ran over and there was a fight--there
was a street fight. </p>
<p>A few days later,
March 5<sup>th</sup>, another fight broke out when another civilian said
something insulting to another soldier and they began punching each other and
there was another street fight--and that would be the first in a series of
increasingly agitated clashes on that day, March 5<sup>th</sup>, 1770, that&#39;s
going to end in gunfire. But obviously the Boston Massacre is not the first
moment of conflict. Now later that evening--There&#39;s a series of little
outbursts that day, March 5<sup>th</sup>. Later that evening a small boy
walking out on the street began taunting a soldier, and the soldier responded
by knocking him down. Well, the boy got up, went off, found some other
colonists in the street and complained that a soldier over there had knocked
him down. </p>
<p>Okay. So in this
environment that&#39;s going to really get a lot of colonists upset. So a little
ring of people surrounds the kid. &#39;He&#39;s knocking down a kid? We need to go get
the soldiers.&#39; Right? So a small group of colonists heads off to the barracks
to actually accost the soldiers, but they&#39;re held off by guards. Soon
thereafter, someone begins ringing the bell of the Boston Meeting House--and
normally when you ring the bell of the Boston Meeting House that&#39;s a signal for
fire, and fire is a serious thing in a place full of wooden buildings. Right?
So if the bell is ringing that means, &#39;oh, my God, there&#39;s a fire&#39;--and
everyone does what they should do when there&#39;s an alarm of fire. Right? The
bell goes off and dozens and dozens and dozens of people run in to the street
thinking that there&#39;s a fire. </p>
<p>Now from this point
we have several accounts. There are a number of accounts about what happened,
some of them conflict, and we&#39;re going to be looking at two accounts today.
We&#39;re going to be looking at one by British general Thomas Gage, I mentioned
before, the commander-in-chief of the British army in America. He&#39;s posted in
New York but he had gotten a very detailed report about what happened in Boston
from his soldiers--his officers and men--on exactly what they think they
experienced. And then the other account is by Samuel Adams, radical
propagandist--clearly is going to be a very different point of view. </p>
<p>Okay. So Gage sends
a very detailed report to a member of the King&#39;s cabinet in London based on
what the British soldiers in Boston told him. Assuming that the colonists in
general were insolent and were pushing to get more than they deserved, Gage
says in his statement, he suspects that the entire thing was deliberate. He
thinks that there were some colonists who probably prearranged what happened,
armed themselves with sticks, rocks, bricks and snowballs. I&#39;m sorry, but
snowballs just never sounds like a scary weapon to me, even though bad things
happen here, and I know I would not like to be hit with a snowball, but it&#39;s
not like a brick. But snowballs are--Everyone&#39;s complaining about snowballs in
these accounts you&#39;ll see. Somehow it just makes it seem less serious. I don&#39;t
know why. But anyway, he thinks it&#39;s deliberate; he thinks the colonists
prearranged it; that they armed themselves with sticks, rocks, bricks and
snowballs; planned the ringing of the bell so that Bostonians would rise up at
the signal and attack the soldiers. </p>
<p>Okay. So this is
what Gage assumes--and here is Gage&#39;s account. &quot;Many people came out of
their houses supposing a fire in the town, and several officers on the same
supposition were repairing to their posts; but meeting with mobs were reviled,
attacked, and those who could not escape knocked down and treated with great
inhumanity.&quot; Right? &#39;Those crude, nasty colonists are treating the soldiers
very badly.&#39; </p>
<p>&quot;Different mobs
paraded through the streets, passing the several barracks and provoking the
soldiers to come out. One body went to the main guard where every provocation
was given, without effect, for the guard remained quiet. From thence the mob
proceeded to a sentinel&quot;--a single sentinel -- &quot;posted upon the customhouse, at
a small distance from the guard, and attacked him. He defended himself as well
as he could, calling out for help.&quot; </p>
<p>Okay. There&#39;s one guy
according to this account, and the mob attacks the one guy standing in front of
the customs house. &quot;And people ran to the guard to give information of his
danger.&quot; So according to Gage, people see this one guy getting attacked by a
bunch of people and they--actually colonists--run to get other soldiers to help
the one guy. So according to Gage&#39;s account, they&#39;re not all crazy radicals in
Boston. Some of them are out there helping us. &quot;Captain Preston, hearing the
sentinel was in danger of being murdered&quot;--already; we got to murder really
fast--&quot;he detached a sergeant and 12 men to relieve him and soon after followed
himself to prevent to prevent any rash act on the part of the troops. This
party as well as the sentinel was immediately attacked, some colonists throwing
bricks, stones, pieces of ice, and snowballs&quot;--once again the snowballs--&quot;at
them whilst others advanced up to their bayonets and endeavored to close with
them to use their bludgeons and clubs, calling out to them to fire if they
dared and provoking them in a most opprobrious language.&quot; Right? Again --
&#39;rude colonists behaving badly.&#39; So we have a group of soldiers that are lined
up in front of the customs house running to protect a fellow soldier supposedly
being murdered at the hands of a crude and angry mob armed with sticks and
rocks and snowballs. </p>
<p>Okay. Let&#39;s segue
over to Adams. Adams writes a series of newspaper essays for the <i>Boston
Gazette </i>describing the same incident, often quoting testimony from the
trial of the soldiers that obviously takes place after this incident, but also
obviously quoting them and telling the story with his own radical flair. Now
remember here the different reasons for these accounts. And this is actually a
great example of the importance of thinking about the nature of historical
evidence. Who things are written to and why they&#39;re written has a <u>lot</u> to
do with how you interpret them. Right? You have these two documents being
written for really specific reasons to a very specific audience. </p>
<p>So Gage is trying to
explain to royal authorities a shooting that never should have happened. He has
to somehow justify this, so he&#39;s appealing to the people he sent the letter to--whoever
this royal authority was--and he has to assume that other royal authorities are
going to see it. He&#39;s appealing to them as fellow sophisticated Englishmen who
understand the nature of things out in this sort of frontier colony area, crude
colonists, upset colonists. So in a sense Gage is offering sort of an extreme
version of some typical English sentiment among--about the colonies. </p>
<p>Adams is writing to
the colonial public and he&#39;s trying to raise a public outcry against the
soldiers and obviously by association, against the British administration, and
clearly Adams is going to want to depict these soldiers as cruel and tyrannical
as all standing armies are, so in a sense Adams is certainly going to be
offering an extreme version of some colonial sentiment at the time about the
soldiers and maybe about the British administration generally. </p>
<p>Okay. So here is
Adams&#39; version from the moment when the bell starts to ring [correction: the
account is taken from several of Adams&#39; newspaper articles in 1770 and 1771].
&quot;The ringing of the bells alarmed the town, it being supposed by the
people in general there was a fire. As the people came in to the street, the
boy who had been knocked down told them that the sentry had knocked him down.&quot;
Okay, and I&#39;m actually quoting so this--you can&#39;t blame me for this. The boy
says, &#39;A sentry knocked me down,&#39; points at the solider and says, &quot;There&#39;s the
son of a b[it]ch that knocked me down.&quot; [laughter] I love that that detail is
in the newspaper [laughs]--and that&#39;s another one of those things that like--they
said that in 1770? [laughter] And they did. Other people heard this and
cried, &quot;Kill him.&quot; [laughter] Hey. [laughs] &quot;The sentry ran to the custom-house
steps, knocked at the door, but could not get in.&quot; &#39;Excuse me. [laughs] They&#39;re
going to kill me.&#39; He primed and loaded his gun and leveled it and told the
people to stand off, and called to the main guard. &quot;Various were the
dispositions and inclinations of the people&quot; at this point. &quot;The cooler sort
advised to go home: The curious were willing to stay and see the event, and
those whose feelings were warmer, perhaps partook of the boy&#39;s
resentment.&quot; </p>
<p>And here he&#39;s trying
to justify like--okay there were some crazy, radical guys but they were
probably upset with the boy. Right? They weren&#39;t angry. They were just--Of
course they&#39;d be upset. The boy was attacked. The soldiers moved to help the
sentry standing alone before the mob. Adams said the soldiers moved, quote,
with &quot;an haughty air--they push&#39;d their bayonets and damn&#39;d the people as they
went along--and when they arriv&#39;d at their post, one witness who is a young
gentleman of a liberal education and an unspotted character, [laughter]
declared, that one of the prisoners [i.e. soldiers] whom he particularly named,
loaded his gun, pushed him with his bayonet and damn&#39;d him.&quot; Ooh. Okay.
[laughter] So here, according to Adams, there&#39;s this rude, imperious British
soldier treating the young gentleman of a liberal education and unspotted
character [laughs] like a lesser being. </p>
<p>Okay. So now both
narrators have gotten us to the same point. We have soldiers lined up. They
have just very visibly loaded their guns. In front of them stands British Captain
Preston with--who is in command of the men--and in front of Preston is an angry
crowd. So according to Gage, at this point Preston--soldiers behind him--crowd
in front of him--he&#39;s trying to calm the situation down, and supposedly he&#39;s
asked, &#39;Are you going to ask those soldiers to fire on us?&#39; and Preston says, &#39;Yeah.
See, the guns are behind me and you&#39;re in front of me. No. Really. [laughter]
It wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for them to fire now because I&#39;ll die.&#39; Right? [laughter]
He&#39;s like &#39;No.&#39; It&#39;s a good point I think. </p>
<p>But &quot;all he could say
had no effect, and one of the soldiers, receiving a violent blow, instantly
fired. Captain Preston turned around to see who fired, and received a blow upon
his arm, which was aimed at his head; and the mob, at first seeing no execution
done and imagining the soldiers had only fired powder to frighten [them], grew
more bold and attacked with greater violence, continually striking at the
soldiers and pelting them, and calling out to them to fire.&quot; And we have
Captain Preston&#39;s description of what he heard from the crowd. He says the
crowd was yelling, &quot;Come on, you rascals, bloody backs, lobster scoundrels.&quot; [laughs]
Quite a little string of insults. &quot;Fire if you dare. You dare not fire.&quot;
Okay. So Gage goes on, &quot;The soldiers at length perceiving their lives in
danger, and hearing the word &#39;fire&#39; all round them, three or four of them fired
one after another, and again three more in the [same] hurry and confusion. Four
or five persons were unfortunately killed&quot;--unfortunately--&quot;and more
wounded.&quot; Okay. So that&#39;s basically the end of Gage&#39;s account. Clearly,
in his account the soldiers are under serious attack. </p>
<p>Adams tells a
different story. Adams says, &#39;Yes, the crowd was yelling at the troops but they
had insulted the crowd and loaded their guns. Yes, they had sticks but
everybody was carrying sticks these days because everyone was scared of the
soldiers, so everyone naturally walked around in the streets with sticks.&#39; Now
maybe that&#39;s true, which tells you a lot about the streets of Boston, or maybe
it&#39;s not in which case it&#39;s really creative. [laughter] &#39;Yes, the crowd hit at
the soldiers&#39; guns but they were trying to push them away.&#39; So Adams says it&#39;s
not an uncontrolled mob; it&#39;s actually a group of people carrying their normal,
everyday sticks, [laughter] pushing in to hear Captain Preston answer the
question about whether or not he was going to order the troops to fire. </p>
<p>At this moment, Adams
says, one of the soldiers was hit by a stick, staggered, fired his gun at the
crowd upon which several soldiers fired and says Adams, &#39;they reloaded their
guns. They were going to fire again.&#39; Some of the crowd moved away. One man
went up to a soldier and asked him to his face if he was going to fire, and
supposedly the soldier said, quote, &quot;Yes by the eternal God&quot; at which
point the colonists knocked him down. [laughter] I love all the detail. At
this point Preston called out to his men not to fire and they stopped, and here
Adams says, &quot;I am no Soldier, and never desired to be one: but I appeal to
those who are, whether the words, &#39;Don&#39;t fire,&#39; are words of command in the
British army; and whether there is not some other word which Soldiers are
taught to understand, more proper to be given on such an occasion . . . which
would have prevented such rashness.&quot; So here he&#39;s saying, &#39;The guy didn&#39;t
even call out cease fire. He said, &#39;Don&#39;t. Stop.&#39;&#39; [laughs] Great. Thank you,
Captain Preston. And then Adams describes the people who died. He makes
special note of the fact that Grey, the rope maker who insulted the sentry by
asking him to clean the outhouse, is killed in the clash. Coincidence or
murder? [laughter] Adams is good. Right? </p>
<p>And so here Adams is
tossing out the suggestion that maybe the troops were just looking for an
excuse to fire on the townspeople--and then really get that nasty Grey--plotting
maybe. And the British too, as you&#39;ve heard, are wondering if maybe this is a
plot on the part of the colonists. Maybe they&#39;re actually just trying to rob
the customs house and this whole thing was an elaborate ploy by the colonists
just to rob the customs house behind the guard. </p>
<p>So you can really see
from these two accounts, and from the details contained within them, the
animosity and the sense of alienation between the colonists and the soldiers on
both sides, and you can also see really dramatically the fears on both sides
that there&#39;s some kind of a plot; there&#39;s some kind of a plot of resistance or
tyranny, depending on which side you&#39;re on. Somehow this is organized and it&#39;s
not good and it has to be stopped--and both sides have come to that same point.
And I will stop there and we will continue next week on to the logic of
resistance. </p>
