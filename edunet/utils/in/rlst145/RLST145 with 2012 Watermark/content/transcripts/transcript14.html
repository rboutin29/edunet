<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> We were talking last time about
the establishment of the monarchy or kingship in Israel and I want to
say a little bit about some of the features of Israelite kingship, and
today I'll be coming back frequently to the Israelite notions of
kingship and royal ideology. But to start off: one of the most
important things to realize is that the king in Israel was not divine,
as he was in Egypt, or even semi-divine. Occasionally, he offered
sacrifice but he didn't play a regular role in the cult. Israelite
royal ideology was heavily indebted to Canaanite royal ideology. You
have similar language that's applied to the kings of Israel. The king
is said to be appointed by the deity or deities to end wickedness, to
enlighten the land, he is the channel of prosperity and divine blessing
for the nation. All of this is true of Canaanite kings as well, and the
king, as we've seen, is spoken of as God's son. That doesn't imply
divinity. It's a metaphor, the metaphor of sonship. It was used for the
Canaanite gods as well, and it expressed the special relationship
between the king and the deity. It was the same relationship as was
found between that of a suzerain and a vassal, and in our suzerainty
treaties, also, the vassal is the son of the suzerain. It's a kind of
adoption, and what it means is that the one who is metaphorically the
son is to serve the father loyally, faithfully, but is also susceptible
to chastisement from him. And that's what we saw in Nathan's statement
or pronouncement or prophecy to David last time.</p>

<p>Michael Coogan points out that the notion of the sonship of the king
was revolutionary [see note 1]. It was a deliberate effort to replace
an earlier understanding according to which the entire nation of Israel
was God's son. You remember during the plagues in Egypt when God refers
to Pharaoh as having oppressed His son, Israel, His firstborn. As
Yahweh's son, the king now is standing between God and the people as a
whole. And we're going to return in a moment to this new royal ideology
and what's really going to be a very tense juxtaposition with the
covenant theology. But first I want to say a little bit more about the
characters of David and Solomon before going into the way royal
ideology was later developed.</p>

<p>In the Bible, David is second only in importance and in textual
space to Moses; the amount of space that's devoted to him, is second
only to Moses. There are three characteristics of David which stand
out, and the first is that he's described as being quite proficient in
music and poetry and so we'll see that later tradition is going to
attribute to him not only the invention of various instruments but also
the composition of the Book of Psalms. It seems to make sense that he
would be the composer of the Book of Psalms in that he has a reputation
for poetry and music. He is also credited with great military and
tactical skill and confidence. He deploys his army on behalf of Israel
but he also, once he is king, deploys his army within Israel against
his rivals. Third, he is depicted as a very shrewd politician. And it
was David who created permanent symbols of God's election of Israel,
God's election of David himself, God's election of David's house or
line or dynasty to rule over Israel in perpetuity. It is said that he
conceived the idea of a royal capital. He captured the city of Jebus,
Yebus--it was a border town so it was free of any tribal association. I
guess it's sort of like Washington, D.C.; it's not located really
within any one tribe; and he captured this and built it up as the city
of David. The city was going to be renamed Jerusalem and it would
become understood as the chosen city, the place where God caused His
name to dwell: as Deuteronomy said, there would be a place where God
would choose to cause His name to dwell. And so Jerusalem becomes a
symbol of God's presence, it becomes a symbol of Israel's kingdom, the
monarchy; it becomes a symbol of the dynasty of David. It is referred
to as the City of David. David transfers the Ark to this city and so he
makes it the home to the ancient witness of the covenant, the Sinaitic
Covenant. The added implication is that the Davidic dynasty has
inherited the blessings of the covenant. It is somehow fulfilling the
promise to the patriarchs, which is also associated with the nation of
Israel at Sinai. He planned a temple that would become the permanent
resting place for the ark and a cultic center for all Israel but the
building of this temple was left to Solomon so we'll discuss it and its
symbolism when we get to Solomon. But according to the biblical record
it was still David who made the chosen dynasty, the chosen city, what
would eventually be the temple, into permanent and deeply
interconnected symbols of the religion of Israel. And it's really with
David that the history of Jerusalem as the Holy City begins.</p>

<p>Now the biblical assessment of David is initially relatively
positive, and this changes shortly after his ascension to the throne.
Beginning in 2 Samuel from about chapter 9 to 20 and then on into the
first couple of chapters of Kings, you have a stretch of text which is
often referred to as the Court History or the succession narrative of
David. The critical question that drives this particular historical
fiction is the question of succession: who will succeed David? He has
many children but one by one his sons are killed, or they're displaced
or disqualified in one way or another, until finally there is Solomon.
There are lots of wonderful major and minor characters in this drama.
It's a very complex drama, lots of intrigue and passion, but the
material in this section also presents a rather unusual portrait of
David. He's weak, he's indecisive, he's something of an anti-hero. He
stays home in the palace while other people are off leading battles and
fighting the wars. He enters into an illicit relationship with a
married woman, Bathsheva (or Bathsheba). He sees to it that her husband
is killed in battle to cover up his affair. It's this combined act of
adultery and murder that earns him a sound scolding from Nathan, the
prophet Nathan--we'll come to that when we talk about prophets next
week. But God punishes him with the death of his son. And it's really
from this point on in the story that we see David losing control over
events around him; his control declines. He is indecisive on the whole
question of succession and that leads to all kinds of resentment and
conflict as well as revolts.</p>

<p>There's one revolt, which is a revolt in support of his son,
Absalom. That's a revolt that the Deuteronomistic historian also
indicates was a punishment for his affair with--for David's affair with
Bathsheba. But during this revolt David flees from his enemies, he's
stripped of his crown, he's degraded. When Absalom is killed David
weeps for his son uncontrollably and this only angers his own
supporters who fought so earnestly against Absalom in his [David's]
defense; it's a very poignant moment. But by the end of the story,
David is almost completely impotent, and senile even. The prophet
Nathan and Bathsheba plot to have Bathsheba's son, Solomon, named the
successor of David and there really is no point at which there's any
divine indication that Solomon has won divine approval, no divine
indication that he is the one. It happens through palace intrigue,
particularly with Bathsheba and Nathan. But the northern tribes--there
are signs throughout the story of the hostility of the northern tribes
and that's a warning sign, that's a warning sign of future
disunity.</p>

<p>This whole court history is just a wonderful, masterful work of
prose. You're going to be reading something from a book by a fellow
named Meir Sternberg, which is I think just a wonderful study of the
Bathsheba story [see note 2]. Some speak about all of this unit as
being authored by the J source. You need to know that source theory has
undergone so many permutations. There really isn't any standard view
but I think the idea that the sources J, E, P and D extend beyond the
Pentateuch is now generally no longer accepted so you will sometimes
see people talking about the J source as going all the way through the
end of Second Kings and being in fact--J is the author of the court
history. But for the most part I think most people think of the source
theory as applying to the Pentateuch, and beyond that we talk about the
Deuteronomistic historian redacting older earlier sources. I'll talk a
little bit more about some of those sources as we move through the
later books, the books of the former prophets.</p>

<p>The court history has an array of very richly drawn characters. They
act out all sorts of scenes of power and lust and courage and struggle.
There's crime, there's tender love. It's a very realistic sort of
psychological drama. It's also striking for its uncompromising honesty.
We don't see anything like that really in the work of any contemporary
historian. David is depicted in very, very human terms. The flattery
and the whitewashing that you find in other ancient Near Eastern
dynastic histories is lacking here. The flattery and whitewashing that
we get for example in Chronicles, the books of Chronicles, are really
just a retelling of the material here in the former prophets and they
clean up the picture of David. There's no mention of Bathsheba in
there. So you do have that kind of whitewashing as part of the
historiography of the Book of Chronicles, but it's lacking here. All of
the flaws, all of the weaknesses of David, a national hero--they're all
laid bare.</p>

<p>Implicitly perhaps, that is a critique of kinship. It is perhaps a
critique of the claim of kings to rule by divine right. The author here
seems to be stressing that David and, as we shall see, Solomon (he's
quite human, Solomon's quite human)--they are not at all divine.
They're subject to the errors and flaws that characterize all humans.
As we move out of Samuel now and into 1 and 2 Kings, we see that these
books, [1 and 2] Kings, contain the history of Israel from the death of
King David until the fall of Judah in 587, 586, and the exile to
Babylonia. These books also appear to be based on older sources. Some
of them are explicitly identified. They will refer sometimes to these
works, which evidently were subsequently lost but they'll refer to the
Book of the Acts of Solomon or the Book of the Annals of the Kings of
Israel, or the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah. Annals and
chronicles were regularly maintained in royal courts throughout the
Ancient Near East. There's no reason to think that this wasn't also
done in a royal setting in Israel. These annals generally listed
events, important events in the reign of a given king. They tended not
to have much narrative to them and the beginning of the first 16
chapters of 1 Kings has that kind of feel, not a lot of narrative, and
[it's] really reportage of events.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1 Kings 17:17-22, and the first nine chapters of 2
Kings, there's a departure from that […] annal style, annal genre [of]
the reporting of events in the reign of a king. You have more developed
narratives in those sources and these narratives generally feature
prophets. So it's going to lead very nicely into our study of Prophets
beginning on Monday. Some of the narratives evidently would have
circulated independently, particularly the stories, probably, about
Elijah and Elisha, these zealous Yahweh-only prophets. They were
probably local heroes and these stories circulated independently, but
they've come to be embedded in a framework that conforms those sources
to the ideology and religious perspective of the Deuteronomistic
historian.</p>

<p>1 Kings 2 is the death scene. It has David's deathbed instructions
to his son, Solomon. He tells Solomon to kill all of his rivals and
opponents and in verse 12 we read, "And Solomon sat upon the throne of
his father, David, and his rule was firmly established." And it seems
that at this point the three crises that we noted in the Book of
Samuel, at the opening at 1 Samuel, the three crises we noted are
resolved. The crisis in succession is resolved. David is succeeded by
his son, Solomon, and all of the kings of Judah for the next 400 years
in fact, until the destruction in 586, all of these kings will be of
the line of David. The military crises seem for now to have been
resolved. We've had lots of military and diplomatic successes and
Israel seems to be secure. And also the religious crisis that we
mentioned is resolved. The Ark was retaken from the Philistines, it's
been brought to Jerusalem, it's been installed in Jerusalem, and now a
magnificent temple is planned that will house the Ark and be a site for
the central worship of all Israel.</p>

<p>But the resolution of these crises came at a cost. They produced
fundamental changes in Israelite society. From a loose confederation of
tribes--however idealistic that picture was--but from a loose
confederation of tribes united by a covenant, we've now got a nation
with a strong central administration, it's headed by a king. And that
king seems to enjoy a special covenant with God. Rather than
charismatic leaders who rise as the need itself arises and then fade
away, we now have permanent kings from a single family. And preserved
in the biblical sources is a tension, a tension between the old ideas
of the covenant confederation, what we might call covenant theology,
and the new ideology of the monarchy. This new royal ideology combines
loyalty to God and loyalty to the throne, so that treason or rebellion
against God's anointed is also apostasy, it's also rebellion against
God Himself. The two become conflated.</p>

<p>There's a scholar named Jon Levenson, I've talked about him before
in connection with the covenant at Sinai, but in this wonderful book
called <i>Sinai and Zion</i> [see note 3] he really juxtaposes these
two ideologies. He points to this deep tension between the covenant
theology and the royal ideology. In covenant theology, Yahweh alone is
the king. He's got a direct suzerain-vassal relationship with the
people. So Israel is the subject of covenant theology. The covenant
theology therefore implies almost automatically a somewhat negative
view of the monarchy and that's what we've seen here and there, in the
Book of Judges and in Samuel. Monarchy is at best unnecessary and at
worst it's a rejection of God. Nevertheless, despite that resistance or
that critique, monarchy, kingship, is established in Israel, and
Levenson sees the royal ideology that developed to support this
institution as a major revolution in the structure of the religion of
Israel. Where the Sinaitic Covenant was contracted between God and the
nation, the Davidic covenant is contracted between God and a single
individual, the king. The covenant with David--another scholar, Moshe
Weinfeld, whom I've mentioned before as well, he describes the covenant
with David as a covenant of grant. This is a form that we find in the
ancient Near East also. It's a grant of a reward for loyal service and
deeds. And so God rewards David with the gift of an unending dynasty.
It's a covenant of grant. He grants him this unending dynasty in
exchange for his loyalty. And the contrast with the covenant at Sinai
is very clear. Where Israel's covenant with God at Sinai had been
conditional--it's premised on the observance of God's Torah [and] if
there's violation, then God will uproot the Israelites and throw them
out of the land --the covenant with David, by contrast, with his
dynastic house (and by implication with David's city and the temple
atop Mount Zion), that covenant will be maintained under all
conditions. Remember the passage that we read of Nathan's prophecy last
time. So the royal ideology fostered a belief in some quarters, and
we'll see this in the next few weeks, a belief in the inviolability,
the impregnable nature of, David's house, dynasty, the city itself, the
chosen city, the sacred mountain, the temple. We'll return to this idea
in later lectures. So you have this deep tension lining up Israel's
covenant at Mount Sinai, which is conditional, on the one hand, with
God's covenant with David, which is centered on the temple and palace
complex at Mount Zion, and which is unconditional and permanent.</p>

<p>Scholars have tried to account for these two strands of tradition in
Biblical literature in different ways; the covenant theology with its
emphasis on the conditional covenant with Moses contracted at Sinai;
the royal ideology and its emphasis on the unconditional covenant with
David focused on Mount Zion. One explanation is chronological--that
early traditions were centered around the Sinai event and the covenant
theology. They emphasize that aspect of the relationship with God, and
later traditions under the monarchy emphasize royal ideology. Another
explanation is geographical. The northern kingdom, which if you'll
recall and we'll talk about in a moment, the northern kingdom is going
to break away from the southern kingdom (Davidides will not rule in the
northern kingdom) so the assumption is that the northern kingdom, which
rejected the house of David--they de-emphasize a royal ideology and its
focus on Zion and the house of David, and they emphasize the old
covenant theology and the Sinai theology. And by contrast the southern
kingdom, in which a member of the house of David reigned right until
the destruction, the southern kingdom emphasized Zion and its attendant
royal ideology.</p>

<p>Well, Levenson rejects both of these explanations. He says it isn't
that one is early and one is late, it isn't that one is northern and
one is southern. We find the Sinai and the Zion traditions in early
texts and late texts. We find them in northern texts and in southern
texts. In the south, David's house was criticized just as roundly as it
was criticized in the north, and emphasis was placed on the Sinai
covenant over against the royal ideology in the south as well as in the
north. So the two traditions he said coexisted side by side, they stood
in a dialectic tension with one another in Israel. And eventually they
would come to be coordinated and work together, we'll see that more
towards the end of the lecture. But he says that the Zion ideology will
take on some of the aspects of the legacy of Sinai. Mount Zion will
soon be associated with the site of God's theophony or self-revelation;
it will become a kind of Sinai now permanently in Jerusalem. It would
become the site of covenant renewal. It will be seen as the place where
Torah goes forth, and that's an idea of course originally associated
with Sinai--that's where God's instruction or Torah went [out] first.
But all of these features will be collapsed or telescoped or brought
into Mount Zion and the temple complex. But eventually, he says, it's
not simply that the Sinai covenant theology was absorbed into the royal
ideology and Mount Zion, because the entitlement of the house of David
will eventually be made contingent on the observance of God's Torah.
The king himself, we will see, is not exempt from the covenant
conditions set at Sinai. And even though he would never be completely
deposed for violating the Sinaitic Covenant he will be punished for his
violations. The two will work in tandem. It's an idea that we'll return
to. We'll see it more clearly as we get towards the end of this
lecture. But for now keep in mind that the two are going to be held in
tension and work together to check one another.</p>

<p>Now David's son, Solomon, is given mixed reviews by the
Deuteronomistic historian. He ascends to the throne through intrigue,
as I said, there's really no indication of a divine choice or approval,
but he's said to reign over a golden age. His kingdom is said to
stretch from Egypt to the Euphrates. He made political alliances and
economic alliances throughout the region. He would seal these alliances
with marriages. He married a daughter of Pharaoh. He married the
daughter of the king of Tyre in Phoenicia and so on. The text claims
that he built a daunting military establishment: he put a wall around
Jerusalem, there were fortified cities--Hazor, Megiddo, Gezer--these
were bases for his professional army. It's said that the army featured
a very expensive chariot force. He also had accomplishments in the
realms of industry and trade. He exploited Israel's natural position
straddling the north-south trade routes and was able to bring great
wealth to the state in that way. The daily supplies that were needed to
maintain Solomon's very lavish court are detailed in 1 Kings, so it
seems to have been an extraordinarily elaborate court. He developed a
merchant fleet. He seemed to work closely with the Phoenicians and the
Phoenician King Hiram in developing a merchant fleet and exploited
trade routes through the Red Sea. All sorts of exotic products are
listed as coming in to Jerusalem from Arabia and the African coast. We
have the famous story of the visit of the queen of Sheba. This could
possibly be the Sabean territory in South Arabia and there may be some
basis in fact given these trade routes and how well traveled they were
at this time. And of course he is known for his magnificent building
operations.</p>

<p>Many scholars assume that given this tremendous wealth this would
have been a time for a flowering of the arts, and so it's often been
maintained that this would have been the time for the early traditions,
biblical traditions, early traditions of the nation to be recorded,
perhaps the J source. People date it to the tenth century, the time of
Solomon. But we should be a little skeptical of this grand picture
because archaeologists have found that Jerusalem was a small town; it
was a very small town really until the end of the eighth century [when]
suddenly it absorbed many refugees from the fall of the northern
kingdom. Remember Israel is going to be destroyed in 722, so refugees
fleeing southward will greatly expand Jerusalem; we have archaeological
evidence of that. But there are very few material remains that attest
to a fabulous empire on a scale that's suggested by the biblical text.
Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer, the three places that are mentioned as
fortified military bases, these have been excavated. They do show some
great gateways and some large chambers, even some stables, but
archaeologists differ radically over the dating of these lairs. Some
date them to the time of Solomon, some see it as later. Most concur
that Israel was probably at this time the most important power in its
region, but still it would have been small and relatively insignificant
compared to, say, Egypt or Mesopotamia, some of the great civilizations
at either end of the Fertile Crescent. But it would have been the most
important state in that area and probably was able to have some
dominance over some neighboring areas as well.</p>

<p>I just want to mention three things about Solomon, things that he's
noted for. One is that he's praised for his wisdom and because, again,
the biblical text praises him for his wisdom later tradition will find
it convenient to attribute the Book of Proverbs to him as well as the
Book of Ecclesiastes. These are two works that belong to the genre of
wisdom literature we'll be talking about later in the semester. Second,
in addition to being praised for his wisdom, he's praised for
constructing the temple and in fact the primary focus of all of the
biblical material, or the biblical story of Solomon, is the building of
the temple, the dedication of this temple for the Ark of the Covenant
in Jerusalem. He continued the close association of the cult and the
monarchy, the religious and political leadership, by constructing this
magnificent new temple within the palace complex and he himself
appointed a high priest. So the juxtaposition of the house of the king
and the house of the deity on Mount Zion was quite deliberate. And this
hill, even though geographically it's very small, becomes in the mythic
imagination of Israel, this towering and impregnable mountain.</p>

<p>Levenson again argues that Zion came eventually to take on the
features of the cosmic mountain. The cosmic mountain is a mythic symbol
that we find in the ancient Near East. The cosmic mountain has these
powers or potencies that are universal and infinite and we find it in
the religion of Israel as well, specifically in connection with Mount
Zion. The cosmic mountain in ancient tradition was understood to be the
meeting place of the gods like a Mount Olympus, for example–it's a
cosmic mountain. But it was also understood to be the <i>axis
mundi</i>, that is to say the juncture or the point of junction between
heaven and earth, the meeting place of heaven and earth, the axis
around which these worlds met or were conjoined. In Canaan--in
Canaanite religion the Mountain of Baal, which is known as Mount
Zaphon, was conceived precisely in this manner. And Levenson points out
tremendous commonalities of language and concept in connection with the
Mountain of Baal, the Mountain of El, and the Mountain of Yahweh. In
fact, the word "Zaphon," Mount Zaphon is used to describe God's
mountain in the Bible in one particular passage. So the temple on Mount
Zion came to be understood as sacred space much like the cosmic
mountains of other traditions. It's described as a kind of paradise
sometimes, almost a Garden of Eden. It's described as the place from
which the entire world was created. It's also viewed as a kind of
epitome of the world, a kind of microcosm, an entire microcosm of the
world. It's also seen as the earthly manifestation of a heavenly
temple. The temple came to represent an ideal and sacred realm. And we
also see it as the object of intense longing. Many of the Psalms will
express intense longing: if I could just sit in the temple, if I could
just be in that space, that sacred space--we see it in the Psalms. In a
passage describing the dedication of the temple–it's in 1 Kings
8--Solomon explains that the temple is a place where people have access
to God. They can petition to Him and they can atone for their sins. It
is a house of prayer, he says, and it remained the central focal point
of Israelite worship for centuries.</p>

<p>So his great wisdom, his great virtue in constructing the temple
notwithstanding, Solomon is very sharply criticized for, among other
things, his foreign worship. His new palace complex had a tremendous
amount of room for his harem, which is said to have included 700 wives.
Many of them were foreign princesses, many of them would have been
acquired to seal political alliances or business alliances, noblewomen.
700 wives and 300 concubines, as well as various officials and
servants. Now of course these numbers are likely exaggerated, but
Solomon's diplomatic alliances likely necessitated unions that would of
course have been condemned by the Deuteronomistic historian. He is said
to have loved foreign women, from the nations that God had forbidden
and he succumbed to the worship of their gods and goddesses, which is
really the key point. The whole fear of a foreign spouse is that one
will be led to or will support the worship of foreign deities, and so
Solomon is said to have built temples for Moabite gods and Ammonite
gods. This all may point to a general tolerance for different cults in
Jerusalem in the tenth century and in the ninth century. This may not
have been an issue in Jerusalem in the tenth and ninth century, but
it's an issue for the later Deuteronomistic editor. They have no
tolerance [for] this.</p>

<p>So Solomon's primary flaw in the Deuteronomistic historians' view is
his syncretism, which is prompted by his marriages to these foreign
women who brought their native cults to Jerusalem. His religious
infidelity is said to be the cause of the severe problems and
ultimately the division of the kingdom that will follow upon his death.
In order to support this tremendous court and harem, as well as the
army and the bureaucracy, Solomon did introduce heavy taxation as well
as the <i>corvée</i>, which is forced labor or required labor on state
projects. So you have this developing urban structure, complex
developing, bureaucratic urban structure that's now being superimposed
on the agricultural life, and that leads to all sorts of class
distinctions and class divisions between officials, bureaucrats,
merchants, large-scale landowners who are prospering perhaps, smaller
farmers and shepherds who are living at more of a subsistence level. So
you have divisions between town and country, between rich and poor. And
this is a great change from the ideals of the tribal democracy, some of
the ideals that some of you looked at when we were talking about legal
texts, where there seemed to be these economic blueprints for bringing
about economic equivalence through sabbatical years and jubilee years
and so on. In short, the list of social and economic ills that were
enumerated by Samuel (in 1 Samuel 8, when he was trying to persuade the
people from establishing a monarchy), that list of ills--you'll have a
standing military, a standing army you'll have to support, you'll have
to do labor for the state, you're going to have all kinds of taxes and
special levies, you're going to be virtually enslaved--many of these
things seem to have been realized, the Deuteronomistic historian would
like us to believe, in the reign of Solomon.</p>

<p>Moreover, as we've already seen, the very institution of monarchy
itself didn't sit well in some quarters because centralized leadership
under a human king seemed to go against the older traditions of Hebrew
tribal society, united by covenant with God, guided by priests,
prophets, occasional judges inspired charismatically. So already before
Solomon's death, the northern tribes were feeling some alienation from
the house of David. They're resenting what they perceive to be
Solomon's tyranny.</p>

<p>So let me give you a brief timeline of what happens from the death
of Solomon down to the destruction. And on one of the earlier handouts
I gave you, there is a list of the kings north and south. This is not
something you need to memorize and I'm certainly not going to stress
it, but if you want to keep score, that's a list that you can refer to.
So, when Solomon died in 922 the structure that had been erected by
David and Solomon fell into these two rival states and neither of them
of course is going to be very strong. You have the northern kingdom of
Israel and the southern kingdom referred to as Judah, each with its own
king: Jeroboam in the north, Rehoboam in the south. Sometimes they're
going to be at war with one another, sometimes they're going to work in
alliance with one another, but 200 years later, from 922 down to 722,
200 years later the northern kingdom of Israel will fall to the
Assyrian empire.</p>

<p>The Assyrians come down to the border of the southern kingdom, to
Judah, and Judah remains viable but it is reduced to vassal status. It
is tributary to this new world power. Finally, Judah will be destroyed
about 150 years later --about 587, 586. The Babylonians, the
neo-Babylonian empire, they have conquered the Assyrians and they
assume control over the ancient Near East and take the southern
kingdom. Now the story of the northern kingdom, Israel, that is
presented in Kings, is colored by a Judean perspective, and it is
highly negative and highly polemical. So Solomon was succeeded by his
son, Rehoboam, but the ten tribes of the north revolted when he refused
to relieve their tax burden. They came to him and asked if they could
have some relief and he answered them very harshly, so they revolted
and a separate kingdom was set up under the rule of the Israelite
Jeroboam, just at the end of the tenth century. So divided now into
these two kingdoms, they begin to lose power, probably losing any
control they may have had over outlying territories.</p>

<p>So let's focus first on the northern kingdom of Israel. The area was
more divided by tribal rivalries and religious traditions than Judah.
You have ten tribes in that region. Jeroboam didn't seem to be able to
establish a very stable rule. 1 Kings 12 tells us of Jeroboam's effort
to break the connection with the traditional religious center of
Jerusalem in the south. He establishes his own government at
Shechem--that was a place that was already revered in Hebrew tradition.
This is where we have the covenant renewal ceremony by Joshua, so it's
already a somewhat sacred site. So he establishes his capital in
Shechem, and then he establishes royal shrines, one in the southern
part of Israel and one in the northern part of Israel; on each of the
borders, north and south of the kingdom, in Dan and Bethel (Bethel in
the south and Dan in the north). A golden calf is placed in each shrine
according to the text, and this is viewed by the Deuteronomistic
historian as a terrible sin. Indeed the story is written in a manner
that deliberately echoes the story of the golden calf that was made by
Aaron in Exodus 32. There are linguistic echoes that make it very clear
that we are supposed to view this as a sin as great as the sin of
Aaron. It may well be that if Jeroboam did in fact do this that he was
a good Yahwist and was just trying to establish alternate sanctuaries
for Yahweh that would rival Jerusalem's. But the Deuteronomistic
historian wants to see this as another instance of idolatry, and
therefore, deliberately echoes the primordial cultic sin of the golden
calves when talking about Jeroboam's activity. It brands his cultic
center as illegitimate idolatry. Jeroboam is represented by the
biblical writer as having made unacceptable concessions to Canaanite
practices of worship, and so he is criticized for this. Despite his
best efforts, his kingship is fairly unstable, and in fact in the
200-year history of the kingdom, the northern kingdom of Israel, we
will have seven different dynasties occupying the throne. There was
great material prosperity in the northern kingdom. I've just picked out
a few kings to highlight so these are not to be understood to be
necessarily in order, I've just picked out a few highlights, but the
rule of Omri was a time of some material prosperity and his son, Ahab.
Ahab was the first part of the ninth century.</p>

<p>Omri is an interesting person because he's the first king from
either kingdom to be mentioned in sources outside the Bible. We have a
large stone referred to as the Moabite Stone and in this stone, which
boasts of a military defeat, there's the boast that Omri of Israel was
defeated. Omri bought and fortified Samaria as the capital of the
northern kingdom of Israel, and archaeology does reveal that this was
in fact quite a magnificent city at this time. But again the
Deuteronomistic editors are going to judge him as evil. He's disobeyed
God. His son, Ahab, also comes in for bad press. Ahab is also mentioned
outside the Bible. We have an inscription of an Assyrian king who
describes a coalition of Israelites and Aramaeans who fought against
the Assyrians, and Ahab is mentioned in that inscription. Omri and Ahab
were clearly very powerful and influential in the region. They are even
mentioned outside the Bible. Ahab and his Phoenician wife, Jezebel,
seem to have established a very extravagant court life in the capital
of Samaria, and for this they are also going to be condemned by the
Deuteronomistic editors. Jezebel was Phoenician and when Jezebel tried
to establish the worship of her Phoenician Baal as the official cult of
Israel (she built a temple to Baal in Samaria) the prophets Elijah and
Elisha preach a kind of holy war against the monarchy. Now we're going
to come back to these very zealous Yahweh-only prophets of the north
when we talk about prophecy next time. Ahab and Jezebel meet a very
tragic end and there will be a military coup. A military coup led by an
army general, Jehu, in about 842. These are all kind of approximate
years, you know--different books will give the--they'll differ by five
years one way or the other but it's our best effort at reconstructing
things based on some of these outside extra-biblical references that
give us a firm date and then we can kind of work around those.</p>

<p>So the army general Jehu in about 842 led a military coup. He was
anointed king by the prophet Elisha and he had a very bloody revenge on
Jezebel. Jezebel and the priests of Baal were all slaughtered, the text
says, as well as every worshipper of Baal in Samaria; they were all
slaughtered. By the eighth century you have the new Assyrian empire on
the rise, and in 722 the Assyrian king Sargon reduced Israel to the
status of a province. And we have an inscription by Sargon that
confirms the biblical report of this defeat. And in this inscription
Sargon says, "[I besieged, conquered]" Samaria "…led away as prisoners
[27,290 inhabitants of it…. [The town I] re[built] better than (it was)
before and [settled] therein people from countries which [I] myself
[had con]quered." So: population transplanting. "I placed an officer of
mine as governor over them and imposed upon them tribute as (is
customary) for Assyrian citizens" [Pritchard 1958, 1:195; see note 4].
So there's a basic agreement between this and the biblical account.
Many of the governing class, the wealthy merchants, many tens of
thousands in all, were carried off to northern Mesopotamia and they
were lost to history. These are the ten lost tribes of Israel. There
would have remained behind some Hebrew farmers and shepherds, they
would have continued their old ways, but as was consistent with their
policy, the Assyrians imported new peoples to repopulate this area and
to break up any local resistance to their rule and this would then
become the province of Samaria. And this ethnically mixed group would
practice a form of Israelite religion, but the Deuteronomistic editor
does not view it as legitimate and ultimately these Samaritans were
going to be despised by the Jews of the southern kingdom, the Jews of
Judah. They were seen as foreign corruptors of the faith. They were
always ready to assist Judah's enemies against Judah, so they felt very
little kinship and very often the Samaritans would join against, [with]
those attacking Judah. So there was tremendous rivalry between the Jews
of Judah and the Samaritans. Hence, the New Testament story makes
sense--this was a hated person, this good Samaritan.</p>

<p>So if we turn our attention now to the southern kingdom of Judah:
Judah was comprised of the two remaining tribes of Judah and Benjamin,
and it enjoyed internal stability for the most part. It remained loyal
to the house of David ruling in Jerusalem. Shortly after Israel fell in
722 to the Assyrians, the Judahites--whose king at that time was King
Hezekiah, so the king Hezekiah had to agree to terms with Assyria. They
became subject allies or vassals of Assyria. But Hezekiah began to
prepare for rebellion, began to make alliances with neighbors and this
prompted the Assyrians to march in and lay siege to Jerusalem. This
would have happened about 701, and this siege is described in Assyrian
sources, so we have independent records of this from Assyrian sources.
We read there: "As to Hezekiah, the Jew,"--of Yehud, right? the
Jew--"he did not submit to my yoke, I laid siege to 46 of his strong
cities, walled forts," etc. "I drove out…200,150 people…. Himself I
made prisoner in Jerusalem, his royal residence, like a bird in a cage"
[Pritchard 1958, 200]. But eventually the Assyrians actually withdrew
the siege, Judah was able to withstand the siege, preserve their own
kingship. The Assyrian empire is going to fall in 612--this is the fall
of Nineveh you may have heard of at some point--and they will fall to
the rising Babylonians, the neo-Babylonian empire. It's the
neo-Babylonian empire that will succeed in felling Judah under
Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon in 587 or 586. The walls of Jerusalem are
dismantled, many members of the governing classes, wealthier classes,
are going to be carried off into exile in Babylonia. And that the
Hebrews didn't fade into oblivion after the loss of political
independence and their geographical base, is due in large part to the
interpretation of events provided by the Deuteronomistic school.</p>

<p>So we need to talk a little bit about that ideology and why it had
the historical effect that it had. As I mentioned before, Deuteronomy
isn't just the capstone of the Pentateuch's narrative, it's also the
first part of a longer literary history. Martin Noth was the German
scholar who first argued for this, argued that the composition and
authorship of Deuteronomy has more in common with what follows in some
sense than what precedes it. And he argued that we should understand
this to be a unit, the product of a particular School. Since this
Deuteronomistic School is looking back at the history of Israel up to
and including the defeat and exile of the Israelites in 587 or 586, the
final form of the work of the Deuteronomistic School--the final form
must be post exilic. It's post-586, but there are of course various
layers within that larger work that we can't really date with
precision.</p>

<p>I just want to say something about the scholarly methodology that
led to the conclusion that there is such a thing as a Deuteronomistic
School. That method is redaction criticism. And we've already discussed
the goals and the methods of other types of criticism: source criticism
or historical criticism. We've talked a little bit about form criticism
and tradition criticism. But redaction criticism grew out of a kind of
weariness with some of these other forms of biblical criticism and
their constant fragmentation of the biblical text into older sources or
into older genres or into older units of tradition in order to map out
a history of Israelite religion. These other methods seem to pay very
little attention to the text in its final form and the process by which
the text reached its final form. So redaction criticism rejects the
idea that the person or the persons who compiled the text from earlier
sources did a somewhat mechanical scissors and paste job, didn't really
think too much about the effect they were creating by putting things
together. Redaction criticism assumes and focuses on identifying the
purpose and the plan behind the final form of the assembled sources.
It's a method that wants to uncover the intention of the person or the
persons who produced the biblical text in roughly the shape that we
have it, and what was intended by their producing it in the shape that
we have. So redaction criticism proceeds along these lines and this is
how it first developed.</p>

<p>First you can usually identify linking passages, that is to say
passages that kind of join narrative to narrative or unit to unit, in
an attempt to make the text read more smoothly or just to ease the
transition from one source to another. And these linking passages are
assigned to R for redactor. Also assigned to R are any interpretative
passages. That means passages that stand back to comment on the text or
interpret the text in some way. Any place where the narrator turns to
directly address the audience. So for example, when you have a verse in
which the narrator turns and says, "That was when the Canaanites were
still in the land," that would seem to be from the hand of a redactor
putting the sources together. When you have an etiological comment,
that is to say a comment of the type, "And that is why the Israelites
do such and such ritual observance to this day," that also seems to be
written from the perspective of a compiler of sources, someone who's
putting the text together. There are also some passages that vindicate
or justify or otherwise comment on what's about to occur, or passages
that summarize and offer an interpretation or justification of what has
just happened. We'll see that in 2 Kings 17; we also saw that in the
Book of Judges. We had this prospective summary saying: this is what's
going to happen--there's going to be sin, they're going to cry out,
there'll be, you know, God will raise up someone, they'll deliver them
and then they're going to fall back into sin again. So these are
comments that are looking forward to tell us what it is we're about to
read and if you join all such passages together and assign them to R
you very often find that there are tremendous stylistic similarities in
these passages. They use the same rhetoric over and over again or
you'll see the same point of view and it's very often a point of view
that isn't in the source materials that they're linking together. And
this is how one arrives at some understanding of the role of the
redactor in the final production of the text, how the redactor has
framed our understanding of the source materials that he has
gathered.</p>

<p>And the Deuteronomistic historian who is responsible for the
redaction of Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges and so, 1 and 2 Samuel and 1
and 2 Kings, provides not just a history in the sense of documenting
events as they occur (as if there's ever documentation without
interpretation) but provides a strong interpretation of history, a
philosophy of history. He's trying to ascertain the meaning of events,
the larger purpose and design, something we've called a historiosophy.
And we find the Deuteronomists' interpretation of Israel's history in
the preface to the Book of Deuteronomy, we find it in editorial
comments that are sort of peppered throughout Joshua through Kings, and
we especially find it in the summary of the entire unit that is
contained in 2 Kings 17. Before we read that passage we need to think
about what it was that prompted the Deuteronomist to adopt a particular
interpretation of Israel's historical record.</p>

<p>The Deuteronomistic historian was attempting to respond to the first
major historical challenge to confront the Israelite people and the
Hebrew religion. And that was the complete collapse of the Israelite
nation, the destruction of God's sanctuary, and the defeat and exile of
the people of the Lord and God of history. The calamitous events of
722, but especially 587, raised a critical theological dilemma. God had
promised the patriarchs and their descendants that they would live in
His land. He had promised that the house of David would stand forever
but here the monarchy had collapsed, the people were defeated and they
were in exile. So the challenge presented by this twist of history was
really twofold: Is God the god of history, is he omnipotent, is he
capable of all, can he in fact impose and effect His will, and if so
then what about his covenant with the patriarchs and his covenant with
David? Had he faithlessly abandoned it? Well, that was unthinkable.
Then if he hadn't faithlessly abandoned his covenant with his people
and with David, he must not be the god of history, the universal lord
of all. He wasn't able to save his people.</p>

<p>Neither of these ideas was acceptable to the Deuteronomistic school.
It was a fundamental tenet of Israelite monotheism that God is at once
the god of history, capable of all, whose will is absolute, whose
promises are true and at the same time a god of faithfulness who does
not abandon his people, he is both good and powerful. So how could the
disasters of 722 and 586 be reconciled with the conviction that God
controlled history and that He had an eternal covenant with the
patriarchs and with David? The historiosophy of the Deuteronomistic
school is the response of one segment of the Israelite community, we'll
see another response when we turn to the Prophets, but the basic idea
of the Deuteronomistic School is that God's unconditional and eternal
covenants with the patriarchs and with David do not preclude the
possibility of punishment or chastisement for sin as specified in the
conditional Mosaic covenant.</p>

<p>So you see how both ideas are going to be important to hold in
dialectic tension: both theologies, the covenant theology as well as
the patriarchal and royal theology. So this is because although God is
omnipotent, humans do have free will, they can corrupt the divine plan.
So in the Deuteronomistic history the leaders of Israel are depicted as
having the choice of accepting God's way or rejecting it. God tries to
help them. He's constantly sending them prophets who yell at the kings
and tell them what it is God wants of them, but they continue to make
the wrong choice. They sin and ultimately that brings about the fall,
first of Israel and then of Judah and it's the idolatrous sins of the
kings that does it. With the deposition and the execution [correction:
death; see note 5] of the last Davidic king, Zedekiah, the
Deuteronomistic school reinterpreted the Davidic Covenant in
conditional terms on the model of the Sinaitic Covenant, the Mosaic
Covenant, according to which God's favor toward the king depends on the
king's loyalty to God, and in this way the fall of the house of David
could be seen as justifiable punishment for disobedient kings or rulers
like Manasseh. (We'll come back to him.) Remember the Davidic Covenant
that Nathan proclaimed in 2 Samuel 7 explicitly said that God would
punish and chastise his anointed. That's what it means to be a son, to
receive correction, discipline and punishment. I'll have to finish this
these thoughts on Monday and see specifically how they interpret and
understand the history of what happened in a way that enabled certain
segments of the population to see this as in fact proof of God's
strength and faithfulness. And then we'll turn to prophecy on
Monday.</p>
