<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> I mentioned in the opening lecture
that this course is going to examine the biblical corpus from a variety
of different viewpoints and take a variety of approaches, historical,
literary, religious, cultural. And today we are going to begin our
appraisal of the first portion of the Bible as the product of a
religious and cultural revolution. The Bible is the product of minds
that were exposed to and influenced by and reacting to the ideas and
cultures of their day. And as I suggested in the opening lecture,
comparative study of the literature of the Ancient Near East and the
Bible reveals the shared cultural and literary heritage at the same
time that it reveals great differences between the two. In the
literature of the Bible some members of Israelite society--probably a
cultural religious and literary elite--broke radically with the
prevailing norms of the day. They mounted a critique of prevailing
norms. The persons responsible for the final editing and shaping of the
Bible, somewhere from the seventh to the fifth or fourth century
BCE--we're not totally sure and we'll talk more about that--those final
editors were members of this group. And they had a specific worldview
and they imposed that worldview on the older traditions and stories
that are found in the Bible. That radical new worldview in the Bible
was monotheism. But why, you might ask, should the idea of one God
instead of many be so radical? What is so different? What's different
about having one God, from having a pantheon of gods headed by a
superior god? What is so new and revolutionary about monotheism?</p>

<p>Well according to one school of thought there isn't anything
particularly revolutionary about monotheism; and the classical account
of the rise of monotheism, that has prevailed for a very long time,
runs as follows, and I have a little flow chart here to illustrate it
for you. The argument goes that in every society there's a natural
progression: a natural progression from polytheism, which is the belief
in many gods--usually these are personifications of natural forces--to
henotheism--"heno," equals one, god--or monolatry, which is really the
worship of one god as supreme over other gods, so not denying the
existence of the other gods, ascribing reality to them, but isolating
one as a supreme god, and onto monotheism, where essentially one
believes only in the reality of one god. And in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries this progression was viewed as an advance, which
is not very surprising because the whole theory was put forward by
scholars who were basically western monotheists. And these scholars
maintained that certain elements of biblical religion represented pure
religion, religion evolved to its highest form, no longer tainted by
pagan and polytheistic elements of Canaanite religion generally. So
applying an evolutionary model to religion carried with it a very clear
value judgment. Polytheism was understood as clearly inferior and
primitive. Monolatry was an improvement. It was getting better. It was
getting closer. But monotheism was judged to be the best and purest
form of religion. And at first the great archeological discoveries that
I talked about last time in the nineteenth century seemed to support
this claim--that Israelite monotheism had evolved from Ancient Near
Eastern polytheism. Cuneiform tablets that were inscribed with the
great literature of Mesopotamian civilizations were uncovered and when
they were deciphered they shed astonishing light on biblical religion.
And these discoveries led to a kind of "parallelomania"--that's how
it's referred to in the literature. Scholars delighted in pointing out
all of the parallels in theme and language and plot and structure
between biblical stories and Ancient Near Eastern stories. So more than
a thousand years before the Israelite legend of Noah and the ark you
have Mesopotamians telling the stories Ziusudra, or in some versions
Utnapishtim who also survived a great flood by building an ark on the
instruction of a deity, and the flood destroys all life, and he sends
out birds to scout out the dry land, and so on. So with parallels like
these, it was argued, it was clear that the religion of the Israelites
was not so different from the religions of their polytheistic or pagan
neighbors. They also had a creation story. They had a flood story. They
did animal sacrifices. They observed purity taboos. Israelite religion
was another Ancient Near Eastern religion and they differed from their
neighbors only over the number of gods they worshiped: one or many. It
was just a more refined, more highly evolved, version of Ancient Near
Eastern religion.</p>

<p>Well, this view, this evolutionary view, or evolutionary model, was
challenged by man a named Yehezkel Kaufmann in the 1930's. And Kaufman
argued that monotheism does not and cannot evolve from polytheism
because the two are based on radically divergent worldviews, radically
divergent intuitions about reality. And in a multivolume work which was
later translated and abridged, and you've got a selection of reading
from the translated abridgment, so it's translated by Moshe Greenburg,
an abridged version of his massive work <i>The Religion of Israel</i>
Kaufman asserted that the monotheism of Israel wasn't, it couldn't be,
the natural outgrowth of the polytheism of an earlier age. It was a
radical break with it. It was a total cultural and religious
discontinuity. It was a polemic against polytheism and the pagan
worldview. That's implicit, he says, throughout the biblical text. It's
been said that Kaufman replaces the evolutionary model with a
revolutionary model. This was a revolution not an evolution. Now one
advantage of Kaufman's model is that we can avoid some of the
pejorative evaluations of polytheism as primitive, as necessarily
earlier and primitive and inferior. We're simply positing the existence
of two distinct orientations, two divergent worldviews. They each have
their explanatory merits and they each have their specific problems and
difficulties. It's not to say that Kaufman wasn't clearly judgmental
but at least the potential is there for us to understand these as two
distinct systems, each again, as I say, with its explanatory merits.
But as we'll see some of the things that monotheism solves only invite
other sorts of problems that it has to wrestle with throughout its long
life.</p>

<p>Now in Kaufman's view the similarities, therefore, between the
Israelites and Ancient Near Eastern religion and cultures that everyone
was so busily finding and celebrating, these were in the end
similarities in form and external structure, appearance. They weren't
essential similarities. They differed in content. Sure they both have
animal sacrifice. Sure they both have ritual purity laws. Sure they
share certain stories and legends. But these have been adopted by the
Israelites and transformed, transformed into vehicles that convey the
basic ideas of the monotheistic worldview. So a similarity in form
doesn't mean a similarity in function; and in this, Kaufman is
anticipating arguments made by anthropologists. The ritual cult of the
Israelites may look like that of their neighbors but it functioned very
differently; its purpose was drastically different from that of
Israel's neighbors. The Israelites like their neighbors may have set up
a king over themselves. But Israelite monarchy differed from Canaanite
monarchy in significant ways because of their monotheism. These are all
things we will test and explore. So the meaning and function of
Israel's cult, of Israel's king, of its creation stories or any of its
other narratives--they derive from the place of those items within the
larger cultural framework or worldview of Israel and that larger
framework or worldview is one of basic monotheism.</p>

<p>So let's turn then to Kaufman's description of the fundamental
distinction between the polytheistic worldview and the revolutionary
monotheistic worldview that took root in Israel. And I am going to be
rehearsing and then critiquing the arguments that are in that
hundred-page reading that I assigned for you this week. This is the
only time something like this will happen in the course. And I do that
because these ideas are so fundamental and we are going to be wrestling
with them throughout the course, so it's important to me that you
absorb this stuff right from the beginning and think about it and be
critical of it and engage it. Kaufman's ideas are very important.
They're also overstated in some ways and that's why we're going to be
wrestling with some of these ideas throughout the course.</p>

<p>So, let's begin with Kaufman's characterization of what he calls
pagan religion--that's the term that he uses. The fundamental idea of
pagan religion, he says, and I quote, is "the idea that there exists a
realm of being prior to the gods and above them, upon which they [the
gods] depend, and whose decrees," even "they must obey" [Kaufman 1972,
22]--the metadivine realm. This is the realm of supreme and ultimate
power and it transcends the deities. The deity or the deities emerge
from and are therefore subject to the laws of the metadivine realm, the
forces and powers of the metadivine realm. And the nature of this realm
will vary from pagan tradition to pagan tradition. It might be water.
It might be darkness. It might be spirit. Or in ancient Greek religion,
a more sort of philosophical polytheism, it might be fate. Even the
gods are subject to the decrees of fate; they have no control over
that. Kaufman asserts, therefore, this belief. Once you posit a
primordial realm, some realm that is beside or beyond the gods, that's
independent of them and primary, you have automatically limited the
gods. So what I've done is I've spelled out here for you, consequences,
logical consequences of positing a metadivine realm. Once you have a
metadivine realm all of these things are going to follow.</p>

<p>The gods are going to be limited. They are not the source of all.
They are bound by, they're subservient to, this metadivine realm. There
can therefore, be no notion of a supreme divine will, an absolute or
sovereign divine will. The will of any one god ultimately can be
countered by the decrees of the primordial realm and the will of all
the gods can be thwarted by the decrees of the primordial realm. The
will of any one god can be thwarted by perhaps another god. So the gods
are limited in power. They're also limited in their wisdom: that falls
under this as well. They're not going to be all-knowing or all-wise
because of the existence of this realm that's beyond them and which is
in many ways mysterious to them as well. It's unpredictable to them
too. It's not in their control or in their power. Individual gods might
be very wise; they might be wise in particular crafts. There might be a
god of healing, very very wise in healing, or a god of some other craft
or area of knowledge. But they possess wisdom as an attribute, not as
an essential characteristic.</p>

<p>Kaufman asserts that mythology is basic to pagan religions.
Mythologies are the lives or tales of the lives of gods, tales of the
lives of the gods. In pagan religions the gods are born, and they live
lives very similar to human lives but on a grand scale and then they
die. They might be reborn too. Pagan religions contain theogonies,
birth of a god, "theogony", accounts of the births of gods. Now this
impersonal primordial realm, Kaufman declares, contains the seeds of
all beings. Very often in these creations stories there is some sense
of some realm from which life begins to emerge usually beginning with
gods. So these cosmogonies and theogonies will describe the generation
of sexually differentiated divine beings; also the generation of the
natural world; also the generation of human beings and animals: in
other words, this is the primordial womb for all that is--divine, human
and natural. It is the source of everything mundane and divine.</p>

<p>What that means, Kaufman asserts, is that in pagan religion there's
very often a fluid boundary between the divine, the human, and the
natural worlds. They blur into one another because they all emerge
ultimately from the same primordial world stuff. These distinctions
between them are soft. We see this in the fact that the gods are very
often associated with natural powerful forces, right? The sky is a god;
the fire is a god; fertility--a natural process--is a god. So there's
no real distinction between the worship of gods and the worship of
nature. Second, he says, because humans also emerge ultimately from
this primordial realm there's a confusion of the boundary between the
divine and the human that's common, he says--he chooses the word
"confusion"--that's common in pagan religion. And so we often have in
pagan religions unions between divine beings and human beings. Kaufman
argues, and I quote, that "the continuity [of] the divine and human
realm is [at] the basis of the pagan belief in apotheosis" [Kaufman
1972, 36]--humans becoming gods; perhaps after death for example
becoming immortal, or very often kings when they ascend to the throne
become gods.</p>

<p>Whatever power the gods have, Kaufman says, is not due to the fact
that their will is absolute or their spirit is absolute. The realm that
transcends the gods, this metadivine realm, is that which has ultimate
power and the stuff of which it is made is what has ultimate power. So
power is materially conceived. It inheres in certain things, in certain
substances, particularly substances or materials that are deeply
connected to whatever this primordial world stuff is. So if it's blood,
then blood that courses through the veins of living creatures is seen
to have some deep and powerful connection with the metadivine realm and
that is where power resides. If it is water, then water will be viewed
as particularly materially powerful in that particular system.</p>

<p>So gods have power only insofar as they are connected with that
primordial world "stuff," a technical term that I use throughout this
lecture! That means that magic is possible in such a system. Because
power is materially conceived--in other words, since it is believed to
inhere in certain natural substances that resemble or are connected to
the primordial world stuff that's the source of all power--then magic
is possible by manipulating those material substances in certain ways.
It might be clay. It might be water. It might be blood. Then whatever
is believed to hold the power of this primordial life force, humans can
tap into, and influence the activities of the metadivine realm. So
through manipulation, magical manipulation of certain substances, they
can harness, Kaufman says, they can harness these forces, these
independent self-operating forces. And so the human magician is really
a technician and he can make these forces come to bear on even the
gods, to coerce the gods to do his will and so on. So magic in a pagan
system, Kaufman claims, is a way of getting around the gods,
circumventing the capricious will of the gods and demons. His magic is
directed at the metadivine realm, trying to tap into its powers. It's
not directed at the gods. It's trying to tap into the ultimate source
of power to use that power to influence the gods in a particular way or
protect oneself against the gods. Similarly, divination. Divination is
an attempt to discern the future that, once again, heads right to the
source of power. It's not directed at the gods, unless you're hoping to
use them as a medium through which to get access to the metadivine
realm, but ultimately most divination is aimed at tapping the secrets
of the metadivine realm and not the gods. Discerning the will of the
gods is really of little use, because even their will can be thwarted
or overthrown by other gods or by the decrees of the metadivine
realm.</p>

<p>The pagan cult, Kaufman claims, is a system of rites. Now I use the
word "cult" and every year people look at me and say "what is cult? I
don't even understand what that means." We'll learn more about "cult,"
but it refers to a system of rites, okay? A system of rites, and we'll
be looking at the Israelite cult later. So the pagan cult, he says, is
a system of rites that involves a manipulation of substances--again,
blood, animal flesh, human flesh, precious metals and so on--that are
believed to have some kind of inherent power, again, because of their
connection to whatever the primordial world stuff may be in that
tradition. So according to Kaufman there's always an element of magic
in the pagan cult. It's seeking through these rituals and manipulations
of certain substances to, again, let loose certain powers, set into
motion certain forces, that will coerce a god to be propitiated, for
example, or calmed or to act favorably or to vindicate the devotees,
and so on. Some of those cultic acts might be defensive or protective
so that the god cannot harm the worshiper. Many of the cultic festivals
are keyed in to mythology, the stories of the lives of the gods. Many
of the cultic festivals will be reenactments of events in the life of
the god: a battle that the god had…the death of the god. Usually in the
winter, cultic rituals will reenact the death of the god and then, in
spring, the rising or resurrection of the god. These are all
reenactment festivals that occur very often. And it's believed that by
reenacting these festivals in this cultic way, one brings magical
powers into play and can in fact ensure and maintain the reemergence of
life in the spring. So it's essential for the maintenance, preservation
of the world.</p>

<p>One final and very important point, and we're going to wrestle with
this quite a bit during the year: Kaufman claims, again, in the
polytheistic worldview, the primordial realm contains the seeds of all
being: everything is generated from that realm, good and bad. So just
as there are good gods who might protect human beings there are also
evil gods who seek to destroy both humans and other gods. Death and
disease are consigned to the realm of these evil demons or these impure
evil spirits, but they are siblings with the good gods. Human beings
are basically powerless, he says, in the continual cosmic struggle
between the good gods and the evil demons, unless they can utilize
magic, divination, tap into the powers of the metadivine realm,
circumvent the gods who might be making their lives rather miserable.
But what's important is that Kaufman insists that in the pagan view
evil is an antonomous demonic realm. It is as primary and real as the
realm of the holy or good gods. Evil is a metaphysical reality. It is
built into the structure of the universe. That's the way the universe
was made. The primordial stuff that spawned all that is, spawned it
good and bad and exactly as it is, and it's there and it's real.</p>

<p>Salvation, he says, is the concern of humans. The gods aren't
interested in human salvation from the capricious forces and powers in
the world because they're trying to save themselves. You know, the good
gods are being attacked by the evil gods; the powers and decrees of the
metadivine realm are hassling them as well as anybody else. So they
can't be worried about humans; they're worried about themselves.
Salvation is attained through magic or gnostic means--gnosticism refers
to knowledge of secrets that can in some way liberate one from the
regular rules--and so as long as one can somehow circumvent the gods,
tie oneself into the powers of the metadivine realm to be beyond the
reach of the demons and the capricious gods who make life on earth a
misery, that is the path for salvation.</p>

<p>So, Kaufman says that the pagan worldview is one of an amoral
universe [looking at the blackboard] somewhere around here…there we go.
Amoral universe. Not a moral universe; not an immoral universe; but an
amoral universe. It is morally neutral. There are gods who are
legislators and guardians of social order and justice. But their laws
aren't absolute: they can be leveled by the decrees of this supreme
metadivine realm. And since the knowledge and wisdom of each god is
limited, morality can be defined as what a particular god likes or
desires and that may be different from what another god likes or
desires. And there's no absolute morality then. And it's that picture
of the universe, Kaufman wants to argue, that is challenged by the
monotheistic revolution. Again he sees this as a revolution of ancient
Israel.</p>

<p>So according to Kaufman the fundamental idea of ancient Israelite
writing, which receives no systematic formulation but permeates the
entire Bible in his view, is a radically new idea of a god who is
himself the source of all being--not subject to a metadivine realm.
There's no transcendent cosmic order or power. He does not emerge from
some preexisting realm and therefore he is free of all of the
limitations of myth and magic--we'll go through these one by one--but a
God whose will is absolute and sovereign. All right? So what then are
the implications of the elimination of this metadivine realm? Just as
these points flowed logically from positing a metadivine realm, what
flows logically from eliminating a metadivine realm and positing simply
a god that does not emerge from any preexisting power or order or
realm? Well, first of all there's no theogony or mythology in the
Bible. God isn't born from some primordial womb; he doesn't have a life
story. There's no realm that is primary to him or prior to him and
there is no realm that is the source of his power and wisdom. So in the
opening chapters of Genesis, God simply is. He doesn't grow, he doesn't
age, he doesn't mature, he doesn't have in the Bible a female consort.
God doesn't die. So in the Hebrew Bible, Kaufman claims, for the first
time in history we meet an unlimited God who is timeless and ageless
and nonphysical and eternal.</p>

<p>That means that this God transcends nature. Which means we're going
to get rid of number three [on the blackboard] as well, right? As the
sovereign of all realms, God isn't by nature bound to any particular
realm. He's not identifiable as a force of nature or identified with a
force of nature. Nature certainly becomes the stage of God's expression
of his will. He expresses his will and purpose through forces of nature
in the Bible. But nature isn't God himself. He's not identified [with
it]. He's wholly other. He isn't kin to humans in any way either. So
there is no blurring, no soft boundary between humans and the divine,
according to Kaufman, in the Bible. There's no apotheosis in the Bible.
No life after death in the Bible either. Did you know that? Have to
wait a few centuries for that idea to come along, but certainly not in
the Hebrew Bible: people live 70 years and that's it. So there's no
process by which humans become gods and certainly no process of the
reverse as well. Magic in the Hebrew Bible is represented as useless.
It's pointless. There's no metadivine realm to tap into. Power doesn't
inhere in any stuff in the natural world. So the world is sort of
de-divinized. Demythologized. Power isn't understood as a material
thing or something that inheres in material substances. God can't be
manipulated or coerced by charms or words or rituals. They have no
power and cannot be used in that way, and so magic is sin. Magic is sin
or rebellion against God because it's predicated on a whole mistaken
notion of God having limited power. There are magical conceptions
throughout the Bible--you're going to run into them. But interestingly
enough the editors of the stories in which they appear will very often
hammer home the conclusion that actually what happened happened,
because God willed it to happen. The event occurred because God wanted
it to occur. It didn't occur independently of his will or by virtue of
some power that's inherent in the magician's artifices. So Kaufman
argues that magic in the Bible is recast as a witness to God's
sovereignty, God's power. And they're stripped--magical actions are
stripped--of their autonomous potency. Again, they're serving as
vehicles then for the manifestation of the will of God.</p>

<p>Divination is also unassimilable to the monotheistic idea, according
to Kaufman, because it also presupposes the existence of some
metadivine realm, some source of power, knowledge or information that
transcends God. And again, it's an attempt to reveal God's secrets in
an ungodly way, predicated on a mistake. It is permitted to make
inquiries of God through oracular devices but God only conveys
information at his own will. There's no ritual or incantation, Kaufman
says, or material substance that can coerce a revelation from God. So,
we will see things that look like magic and divination and oracles and
dreams and prophecy in the pagan world and in ancient Israel. But
Kaufman says the similarity is a similarity in form only. And it's a
superficial, formal, external similarity. Each of these phenomena he
says is transformed by the basic Israelite idea of one supreme
transcendent God whose will is absolute and all of these things relate
to the direct word and will of God. They aren't recourse to a separate
science or lore or body of knowledge or interpretive craft that calls
upon forces or powers that transcend God or are independent of God.</p>

<p>By the same token the cult, Kaufman says, has no automatic or
material power. It's not just sort of a place where certain kinds of
magical coercive acts happen. The cult isn't designed to service the
material needs of God, either. It doesn't affect his life and vitality
by enacting certain rituals: you don't ensure that God doesn't die and
so on. No events in God's life are celebrated--the festivals that are
carried out in the cultic context. So the mythological rationales for
cult that you find amongst Israel's neighbors are replaced, and they're
replaced very often by historical rationales. This action is done to
commemorate such and such event in the history of the nation. So pagan
festivals in Israel, Kaufman says, are historicized, commemorating
events in the life of the people and not in the story of the god's life
since we have no mythology. But we are going to be spending a fair
amount of time talking actually about the meaning and the function of
Israel's purity laws and cultic laws in a later lecture.</p>

<p>Now since God is himself the transcendent source of all being and
since he is good, in a monotheistic system there are no evil agents
that constitute a realm that opposes God as an equal rival. No divine
evil agents. Again, in the pagan worldview the primordial womb spawns
all sorts of beings, all kinds of divinities, good and evil that are in
equal strength. They're sort of locked in this cosmic struggle. But in
the Israelite worldview, if God is the source of all being, then
they're can't be a realm of supernatural beings that do battle with
him. There's no room for a divine antagonist of the one supreme God,
which is leading us down here to this point: that sin and evil are
demythologized in the Hebrew Bible. And that's very interesting. It's
going to lead to a lot of interesting things. It's also going to create
a really huge problem for monotheistic thought [that] they're going to
struggle with for centuries and actually still do struggle with today.
But again, in the pagan worldview, sin is understood very often as the
work of a demon or an evil god that might possess a person, might have
to be exorcised from that person by means of magic. If you tap into
some of these substances then you can use the magical, the powers in
those substances, to coerce the demon to be expelled from the person's
body. These are things that are very common in polytheistic and pagan
practices. But in Israel we have no metadivine realm to spawn these
evil beings, these various gods. So Israelite religion did not conceive
of sin as caused by an independent evil power that exists out there in
the universe and is defying the will of God. Instead evil comes about
as a result of the clash of the will of God and the will of humans who
happen to have the freedom to rebel.</p>

<p>There's nothing inherently supernatural about sin. It's not a force
or a power built into the universe. Kaufman is claiming therefore that
in Israel evil is transferred from the metaphysical realm (built into
the physical structure of the universe) to the moral realm. I've put it
up here for you. Evil is a moral and not a metaphysical reality. It
doesn't have a concrete independent existence. And that means that
human beings and only human beings are the potential source of evil in
the world. Responsibility for evil lies in the hands of human beings.
In the Hebrew Bible, no one will ever say the devil made me do it.
There is no devil in the Hebrew Bible. That's also the invention of a
much later age. And that is an important and critical ethical
revolution. Evil is a moral and not a metaphysical reality [pointing to
a student in the classroom]. You had a [question].</p>

<p><b>Student:</b> What about the serpent in the Garden of Eden?</p>

<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> Great. That's what you get to talk
about. Wonderful question. Well what about when Eve is tempted by the
serpent? Who is the serpent? What is he doing? What's going on? What is
Kaufman claiming? Okay. That's exactly the kind of stuff that should be
popping into your head----What about...what about?--okay, and in
section, you're going to be discussing exactly that story. Okay? And
that's one of those texts... and in a minute if I haven't at the end of
a lecture, ask again if I haven't kind of gotten to part of an answer
to your question. Okay? But again, this emphasis on evil as a moral
choice--think of Genesis 4, where God warns Cain, who's filled with
anger and jealousy and is thinking about doing all kinds of horrible
things to his brother, and God says, "Sin couches at the door; / Its
urge is toward you, / Yet you can be its master" [Gen 4:7b]. This is a
question of moral choice.</p>

<p>Final point then is...and we're not going to talk about salvation
right now...but we're going to talk about the fact that the only
supreme law is the will of God, because God is a creator God rather
than a created God. He's imposed order, an order upon the cosmos. And
so the pagan picture of an amoral universe of just competing powers,
good and evil, Kaufman says, is transformed into a picture of a moral
cosmos. The highest law is the will of God and that imposes a morality
upon the structure of the universe. So in sum, Kaufman's argument is
this: Israel conceived of the divine in an entirely new way. Israel's
God differed from the pagan gods in his essential nature. The pagan
gods were natural gods. They were very often associated with blind
forces of nature with no intrinsic moral character, he says. And the
god of Israel was understood to transcend nature and his will was not
only absolute, it was absolutely good and moral. A lot of people say,
well in a way didn't we just rename the metadivine realm God? No.
Because the difference here is that it's posited not only that this God
is the only power but that he is only good. And that was not the case
with the metadivine realm. Right? That was morally neutral. But there's
a moral claim that's being made by the writers of the Hebrew Bible
about this supreme power, this God. God is depicted as just,
compassionate. Morality therefore is perceived as conforming to the
will of God. And there are absolute standards then of justice and
reverence for life.</p>

<p>Now Kaufman says God is demythologized, but even though he's
demythologized he's not rendered completely impersonal. He's spoken of
anthropomorphically, so that we can capture his interaction with human
beings. This is the only way, Kaufman says, you can write in any
meaningful sense about the interaction between God and humanity. So he
has to be anthropomorphized. But the interaction between God and
humans, he says, happens not through nature but through history. God is
not known through natural manifestations. He's known by his action in
the world in historical time and his relationship with a historical
people.</p>

<p>I just want to read you a few sentences from an article Kaufman
wrote, a different one from the one that you read. But it sums up his
idea that there's an abyss that separates monotheism and polytheism and
he says that it would be a mistake to think that the difference between
the two is arithmetic--that a polytheistic tradition in which there are
ten gods is a lot more like monotheism than a polytheistic tradition in
which there are 40 gods, because as you get smaller in number it gets
closer to being monotheistic. He says the pagan idea, and I quote,
"does not approach Israelite monotheism as it diminishes the number of
its gods. The Israelite conception of God's unity entails His sovereign
transcendence over all." That's the real issue. "It rejects the pagan
idea of a realm beyond the deity, the source of mythology and magic.
The affirmation that the will of God is supreme and absolutely free is
a new and non-pagan category of thought" [Kaufman 1956, 13]. That's in
an article in the <i>Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People</i>. And
he goes on again to say that this affirmation isn't stated dogmatically
anywhere but it pervades Israelite creativity, biblical texts. He also
asserts that the idea kind of developed over time, but that basically
there was a fundamental revolution and break, and then within that
there was some development of some of the latent potential of that
idea.</p>

<p>So, which is it, which is part of the question that came from over
here, [gestures toward student who had earlier asked a question]? You
have on the one hand the claim that Israelite religion is essentially
continuous with Ancient Near Eastern polytheism. It's merely limiting
the number of gods worshipped to one, but it houses that God in a
temple. It offers him sacrifices and so on. And then on the other hand
we have Kaufman's claim that Israelite religion is a radical break from
the religions of the Ancient Near Eastern. Well, the value of Kaufman's
work, I think, lies in the insight that monotheism and polytheism in
the abstract--now I'm not sure they exist anywhere in the world--but in
the abstract are predicated on divergent intuitions as systems. They do
seem to describe very different worlds. And therefore as a system, the
difference between Israel's God and the gods of Israel's neighbors was
not merely quantitative. It was qualitative. There's a qualitative
difference here. However when you read his work it's clear that he
often has to force his evidence and force it rather badly. And it's
simply a fact, that practices and ideas that are not strictly or even
strongly monotheistic do appear in the Bible. So perhaps those scholars
who stress the continuity between Israel and her environment are right
after all.</p>

<p>And this impasse I think can be resolved to a large degree when we
realize that we have to make a distinction between--well let's do it
this way first. We're going to talk about a distinction between the
actual--I hate to say that as if I can somehow show you a snapshot of
what people did 3,000 years ago--but between the actual religious
practices and beliefs of the actual inhabitants of Israel and Judah,
we're going to call that Israelite-Judean religion: what somebody back
in the year 900 BCE might have done when they went to the temple; and
what they might have <i>thought</i> they were doing when they went to
the temple, because I'm not sure it was necessarily what the author of
the Book of Deuteronomy says they were doing when they go to the
temple; so there's a difference between what actual people, the
inhabitants of Israel and Judah, did--we'll call that Israelite Judean
religion--and the religion that's promoted, or the worldview, I prefer
that term, that's being promoted by the later writers and editors of
biblical stories who are telling the story of these people--we'll call
that biblical religion, the religion or the worldview that we can see
emerging from many biblical texts. That distinction is found in an
article in your <i>Jewish Study Bible</i>, an article by Steven Geller
(Geller 2004, 2021-2040). You're going to be reading that later on in
the course. But be aware of that distinction and that article.</p>

<p>What second millennium Hebrews and early first millennium Israelites
or Judeans, Judahites, actually believed or did is not always
retrievable, in fact probably not retrievable, to us. We have some
clues. But in all likelihood Hebrews of an older time, the patriarchal
period, the second millennium BCE--they probably weren't markedly
different from many of their polytheistic neighbors. Archaeology would
suggest that. In some ways that's true. We do find evidence in the
Bible as well as in the archaeological record, of popular practices
that are not strictly monotheistic. The worship of little household
idols, local fertility deities, for example. Most scholars conjecture
that ancient Israelite-Judean religion, the practices of the people in
the kingdoms of Israel and Judah in the first millennium BCE, was maybe
monolatrist. They might have promoted the worship of one God, Yahweh,
without denying the existence of other gods and still kept their little
idols and fertility gods or engaged in various syncretistic practices.
It was probably monolatrist rather than monotheistic, really asserting
the reality of only one God. Moreover our evidence suggests that Yahweh
was in many respects very similar to many of the gods of Canaanite
religion. And we'll be talking about some of those at the appropriate
time. But continuities with Canaanite and Ancient Near Eastern
religions are apparent in the worship practices and the cult objects of
ancient Israel and Judah as they're described in the biblical stories
and as we find them in archaeological discoveries.</p>

<p>The Hebrew Bible also contains sources that exhibit features of what
Kaufman has described as contemporary polytheisms. In Genesis 6--I
mean, the text you pointed out is a good one but even better, go look
at Genesis 6 where you have these <i>nephilim</i>, these divine beings
who descend to earth and they mate with female humans. That's a real
fluid boundary between the divine and human realms, if you ask me. But
it only happens there, in one spot. In many passages too Yahweh is
represented as presiding over a counsel of gods. Certainly in the
Psalms we have these sort of poetic and metaphoric descriptions where
God is, "Okay guys, what do you think?" presiding--or he's one of them,
actually. In one Psalm--it's great--he's one of the gods and he says,
"You know, you guys don't know what you're doing. Let me take over."
And he stands up in the council and takes over. And there are other
passages in the Bible too that assume the existence of other gods
worshipped by other nations. So there's certainly stuff like that in
there you have to think about.</p>

<p>Now nevertheless, the most strongly monotheistic sources of the
Bible do posit a God that is qualitatively different from the gods that
populated the mythology of Israel's neighbors and probably also
Israelite- Judean religion. In these sources the Israelites' deity is
clearly the source of all being. He doesn't emerge from a preexisting
realm. He has no divine siblings. His will is absolute. His will is
sovereign. He's not affected by magical coercion. And biblical
monotheism, biblical religion, assumes that this God is inherently
good. He's just. He's compassionate. And human morality is conformity
to his will. Because certain texts of the Bible posit this absolutely
good God who places absolute moral demands on humankind, biblical
monotheism is often referred to as ethical monotheism, so it's a term
that you'll see quite a bit: ethical monotheism. Beginning perhaps as
early as the eighth century and continuing for several centuries,
literate and decidedly monotheistic circles within Israelite society
put a monotheistic framework on the ancient stories and traditions of
the nation. They molded them into a foundation myth that would shape
Israelite and Jewish self-identity and understanding in a profound way.
They projected their monotheism onto an earlier time, onto the nation's
most ancient ancestors. Israelite monotheism is represented in the
Bible as beginning with Abraham. Historically speaking it most likely
began much later, and probably as a minority movement that grew to
prominence over centuries. But that later monotheism is projected back
over Israel's history by the final editors of the Bible. And that
creates the impression of the biblical religion that Kaufman describes
so well.</p>

<p>But the biblical text itself, the biblical record, is very
conflicted, and that's part of the fun of reading it. And you will see
the biblical record pointing to two different and conflicting
realities. You will find religious practices and views that aren't
strictly monotheistic and you'll find later religious practices and
views that are. And the later sources, which we might best call
biblical religion, are breaking therefore not only with Ancient Near
Eastern practices but also with Israelite-Judean practices, with other
elements within their own society. So biblical religion as Kaufman
describes it, isn't, I think, just a revolution of Israel against the
nations. I think it's also a civil war of Israel against itself. And
that's an aspect that is really not entertained by Kaufman. And I think
it's an important one for us to entertain so that we can allow the
biblical text to speak to us in all its polyphony. And not try to force
it all into one model: "Well, I know this is monotheistic text so,
gosh, I'd better come up with an explanation of Genesis 6 that works
with monotheism," You're going be freed of having to do that; you're
going to be freed of having to do that. Let the text be contradictory
and inconsistent and difficult. Let it be difficult. Don't homogenize
it all.</p>

<p>So the differences between the god of the monotheizing sources of
the Bible and the gods of surrounding Mesopotamian literature and older
Israelite ideas, perhaps, they're apparent from the very first chapters
of Genesis. That's a creation story in Genesis 1, we're going to see, a
creation story that's added to the Pentateuch, Pentateuch, the first
five books of the Bible, Genesis through Deuteronomy. This creation
story is added to the Pentateuch probably in one of the last rounds of
editing, probably sixth century perhaps, we don't really know. But
Genesis 1 is a very strongly monotheistic opening to the primeval myths
that are then contained in the next ten chapters of Genesis. So next
time we're going to start with a close reading and examination of
Genesis 1 through 4. We're going to read these stories with an eye to
Israel's adaptation of Near Eastern motifs and themes to sort of
monotheize those motifs and themes and express a new conception of God
and the world and humankind.</p>
