<p><b>Professor Christine Hayes:</b> So last time we started discussing
the historical merits of the biblical stories of the patriarchs and the
matriarchs. These are contained in Genesis 12 through 50. Scholarly
opinion on this matter is seriously divided; something you need to
know. Some scholars will point to internal biblical evidence for the
authenticity and the antiquity of the patriarchal stories. So for
example, Nahum Sarna argues that representing Abraham and Isaac and
Jacob as foreigners and strangers in Canaan is hardly a convenient
tradition for a people who are seeking to establish their claim to its
homeland. And if this myth of origins were the fabrication of a later
writer, then surely they would have written the story in such a way as
to give their ancestors a less tenuous hold or claim, connection, to
the land.</p>

<p>He also notes that some of the material in the patriarchal stories
would be offensive to later religious sensibilities. Jacob is married
to two sisters simultaneously. That is something that is explicitly
forbidden in the book of Deuteronomy. Wouldn't a later writer have
cleaned up this ancestral record if this were in fact something
composed at a later period? Also, he notes that the representation of
inter-ethnic relationships in the patriarchal stories does not accord
with the reality of a later period. So for example, the Arameans are
considered close kin to the Israelites. "A wandering Aramean was my
father," it says [Deuteronomy]. And spouses are always
chosen--daughters for sons are always chosen by going back to the
Aramean people and choosing someone from close kin. But in the period
of the monarchy--that's going to be after 1000--in the period of the
monarchy, there were very poor relations with the Arameans. They were
bitter enemies. So why, according to scholars like Sarna, would a
biblical author from that period portray the Arameans as close kin,
unless they had some older tradition, established tradition that
reflected that fact?</p>

<p>So Sarna and other scholars hold that the patriarchal traditions are
not entirely fabricated retrojections from a later period. They contain
authentic memories of an earlier historic situation. The patriarchs,
it's maintained, were semi-nomads. They lived in tents. From time to
time, they wandered to Egypt or Mesopotamia often in search of pasture
for their animals. And various details of their language, their
customs, their laws, their religion, it's argued, seem to fit well into
the period of the Late Bronze Age. I've given you the periods at the
top of the chart: early Bronze Age; middle Bronze Age from about 2100
to 1550; we date the late Bronze age from about 1550 until 1200--the
introduction of iron and the beginning of the Iron Age in 1200. Prior
to that, the Bronze Age, which is divided into these three periods. So
that's on the one hand: scholars who see these stories as reflecting
historical memories and having a certain authenticity to them.</p>

<p>Then on the other hand, at the other extreme, you have scholars who
see the patriarchal stories as entirely fabricated retrojections of a
much later age. And they vary significantly as to when they think these
stories were written: anywhere from the period of the monarchy all the
way down to the fourth century, some of them. Works published in the
1970s by authors like Thomas Thompson, Jon Van Seters, take the
position that these stories are filled with anachronisms, their
chronologies are confused. These anachronisms and confused chronologies
in the patriarchal stories are the rule rather than the exception in
their view, and they are evidence of a very late date of
composition.</p>

<p>So you have these two extremes based on the internal evidence of the
Bible itself. But you also have the same two extreme positions
reflected in the discipline of archaeology. In the early days,
archaeology of the region tended toward credulity. And it was
explicitly referred to as biblical archaeology--an interesting name,
because it suggests that the archaeologists were out there searching
for evidence that would verify the details of the biblical text. We're
doing biblical archaeology; archeology in support of the biblical
text.</p>

<p>I mentioned last time William F. Albright, an American
archaeologist. He believed strongly that archaeological findings were
important external evidence for the basic historicity and authenticity
of, for example, the patriarchal stories. And certainly some
archaeological findings were quite remarkable. Scholars of the Albright
school pointed to texts and clay tablets that were discovered in second
millennium sites. So you see down on the bottom [of the blackboard] the
second millennium BCE, obviously going down to 1000; first millennium:
1000 to 0. The second millennium really wasn't longer than the first
millennium, it's just that I ran out of board! But specifically sites
like Nuzi and Mari--I've placed them in their approximate places on the
timeline--Nuzi and Mari are sites that are near the area that's
identified in the Bible as being the ancestral home of the patriarchs
in Mesopotamia or on the highway from there to Canaan. These texts and
clay tablets were believed to illuminate many biblical customs and
institutions. So in the Nuzi texts from about the middle of the second
millennium, we learn of the custom of adoption for purposes of
inheritance, particularly the adoption of a slave in the absence of
offspring. Biblical scholars got very excited about this. They point to
the biblical passage in which Abraham expresses to God his fear that
his servant, Eliezer, will have to be the one to inherit God's promise
because Abraham has no son.</p>

<p>Also according to the Nuzi texts, if a wife is barren, she is to
provide a maidservant as a substitute to bear her husband's children.
And this is something that happens with three out of the four
matriarchs, who are afflicted with infertility: Sarah, Rachel and Leah.
There are other parallels in family and marriage law that correlate
with certain biblical details.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century [BCE], the texts from Mari. They contain
names that correspond to Israelite names: Benjamin, Laban, Ishmael. So
biblical scholars, buoyed up by these correlations between the
archaeological finds, the texts found by archaeologists, and biblical
stories, asserted that the patriarchs were real persons and their
customs and their legal practices and their social institutions could
be verified against the backdrop of the second millennium as revealed
by archaeological findings.</p>

<p>However, it's been argued that some of these ancient sources have
been misread or misinterpreted in an effort to find parallels with
biblical institutions. A lot of gap-filling is going on to make these
texts look as though they correspond to biblical institutions. And
skeptics like Thomas Thompson and John Van Seters point out that many
of the biblical customs which are paralleled in Ancient Near Eastern
sources were still alive and well down in the first millennium. So
reference to these customs in the patriarchal stories really doesn't
tell us anything about dating. They could derive from anywhere in the
second or first millennium. And for other reasons, they think it is
much more reasonable to date the composition of these stories to the
first millennium, in some cases, quite late first millennium.
Furthermore, over time, many discrepancies between the archeological
record and the biblical text became apparent. Increasingly,
practitioners of what was now being termed Palestinian archaeology, or
Ancient Near Eastern archaeology, or archaeology of the Levant, rather
than biblical archaeology--some of these archaeologists grew
disinterested in pointing out the correlations between the
archaeological data and the biblical stories or in trying to explain
away any discrepancies in order to keep the biblical text intact. They
began to focus on the best possible reconstruction of the history of
the region on the basis of the archaeological evidence regardless of
whether or not those results would confirm the biblical text, the
biblical account. In fact, this reconstruction often does contradict
biblical claims. We're going to see this quite clearly in a few weeks
when we consider the book of Joshua and its story of Israel's lighting
invasion of the land of Canaan. The archaeological record just doesn't
support such a story.</p>

<p>Still, many people have clung to the idea of the Bible as a
historically accurate document, many times out of ideological
necessity. Many fear that if the historical information in the Bible
isn't true, then the Bible is unreliable as a source of religious
instruction or inspiration. And that's something they don't want to
give up. This is all really a very unfortunate and heavy burden to
place on this fascinating little library of writings from late
antiquity. People who equate truth with historical fact will certainly
end up viewing the Bible dismissively, as a naïve and unsophisticated
web of lies, since it is replete with elements that cannot be literally
true. But to view it this way is to make a genre mistake. Shakespeare's
<i>Hamlet</i>, while set in Denmark, an actual place, is not historical
fact. But that doesn't make it a naïve and unsophisticated web of lies,
because we accept when we read or watch <i>Hamlet</i> that it is not a
work of historiography, a work of writing about history. It is a work
of literature. And in deference to that genre and its conventions, we
know and accept that the truths it conveys are not those of historical
fact, but are social, political, ethical, existential truths. And the
Bible deserves at least the same courteous attention to its genre.</p>

<p>The Bible doesn't pretend to be and it shouldn't be read as what we
would call "objective history"--and see the scare quotes, you should be
looking up here so you'll see the scare quotes: "objective history"--in
other words perhaps, a bare narration of events. To be sure, we do find
that some events that are mentioned in the biblical texts correlate to
events that we know of from sources outside the Bible. So for example,
Pharaoh Shishak's invasion of Palestine in 924. This is mentioned in
the biblical text, it's mentioned in the Egyptian sources--there's a
nice correlation. The destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel in
722, the capture of Jerusalem in 597, the destruction of the temple in
Jerusalem in 586--these are all recorded in the biblical text and they
are in Assyrian and Babylonian records as well; as well as other events
from the period of the monarchy. So as a result, because of these
correlations, many scholars are willing to accept the general biblical
chronology of the period from the monarchy on: starting about 1000 on,
they accept that general chronology; the sequence of kings and battles
and so on.</p>

<p>But ultimately, it is a mistake, I think, to read the Bible as a
historical record. The Bible is literature. Its composition is
influenced and determined by literary conventions and goals. Now, of
course we all know that there is no such thing as purely objective
history anyway. We have no direct access to past events. We only ever
have mediated access in material: archaeological remains that yield
information to us only after a process of interpretation, or in texts
that are themselves already an interpretation of events and must still
be interpreted by us. The biblical narrative is an interpretation of
events that were held by centuries' long tradition to be meaningful in
the life of the people. And to the biblical narrators, these events
known perhaps from ancient oral traditions pointed to a divine purpose.
The narrative is told to illustrate that basic proposition. The
biblical narrators are not trying to write history as a modern
historian might try to write history. They're concerned to show us what
they believed to be the finger of God in the events and experiences of
the Israelite people.</p>

<p>One scholar, Marc Brettler, whose name I've also put up here, Marc
Brettler notes that in the Bible, the past is refracted through a
theological lens if not a partisan political, ideological lens
[Brettler 2005, 22]. But then all ancient historical narrative is
written that way, and one could argue all contemporary historical
narrative is written that way. With due caution, we can still learn
things from texts ancient and modern. We can still learn things about
Israel's history from the biblical sources, just as classical
historians have learned a great deal about classical history, Greece
and Rome, despite or through the tendentious, partisan and
ideologically motivated writings of classical writers.</p>

<p>So our discussion of the patriarchal stories is going to bear all of
these considerations in mind. We're not going to be asking whether
these stories are historically accurate. I'm going to assume they are
not. And once we rid ourselves of the burden of historicity, we're free
to appreciate the stories for what they are: powerful, powerful
narratives that must be read against the literary conventions of their
time, and whose truths are social, political, moral and
existential.</p>

<p>So what are these truths? We'll begin to answer this
question--<i>begin</i> to answer this question, you'll spend the rest
of your life finishing the process of answering this question. But
we'll begin by identifying some, by no means all, of the major themes
of Genesis 12 through 50. And we're going to begin with the story of
Terah and his family. This is a story that's marked by the themes of
divine command and divine promise. Now, the biblical writer represents
the emigration of Terah's son Abram, whose name will be changed to
Abraham, so sometimes I'll say one and sometimes the other. But they
represent this emigration as divinely commanded. It's the first step in
a journey that will lead ultimately to the formation of a nation in
covenant with God. First we meet our cast of characters. This is in
Genesis 11:27 on through chapter 12:3.</p>

<blockquote>Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begot Abram,
Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begot Lot. Haran died in the lifetime of
his father Terah, in his native land, Ur of the Chaldeans. And Abram
and Nahor took them wives, the name of Abram's wife being Sarai [who
will become Sarah]; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah.... And Sarai
was barren; she had no child.<br />
<br />
Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and
Sarai, his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; [getting confused
yet?] and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into
the land of Canaan; but when they came to Haran, they settled
there.<br />
<br />
And the days of Terah were 205 years: then Terah died in Haran.<br />
<br />
Now the Lord said to Abram, "Go from your country and your kindred, and
your father's house, to the land that I will show you."<br />
<br />
I will make of you a great nation,<br />
And I will bless you;<br />
And make your name great<br />
So that you will be a blessing.<br />
<br />
I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you, I will curse;
and by you all the families of the earth shall bless themselves [source
unknown].</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So Abram is commanded to go forth from his home and family to a
location to be named later, a location that remains for now
unspecified. And this is a fact that has caused commentators for
centuries to praise Abram for his faith. That is a virtue--faith is a
virtue--that is connected or associated with Abram/Abraham in other
biblical contexts and also in later religious tradition. He is seen as
the paradigm, the paradigmatic exemplar of a man of faith. The command
is coupled with a promise: "I will make of you," God says, "a great
nation, and I will bless you." But, we have just learned in chapter 11
that Sarai is barren. It was a seemingly irrelevant detail, whose
import is suddenly clear. How clever of the narrator to plant the
information we need to realize that Abram has to take God's word on
faith, and how perfectly the narrator sets up the dramatic tension and
the great confusion that is going to run through the next several
chapters, because Abram doesn't seem to understand that the progeny
will come from Sarai. You have to read these stories as if you're
reading them for the first time. You have the great disadvantage of
knowing the ending. It's a terrible disadvantage. You have to
discipline yourself to read these stories as if you don't know what's
coming next and put yourself in the position of the character. Abram's
just been told he's going to be the father of great nations and he has
a barren wife. He doesn't seem to understand that the progeny is going
to come from Sarai, and why should he think that it would? God wasn't
specific. He simply says, "I shall make of you a great nation." He says
nothing of Sarai, and after all she's barren. So Abram may be forgiven
for thinking that perhaps some other mate awaits him. And so he
surrenders her easily to other men, to Pharaoh of Egypt immediately
following this scene in chapter 11 [and 12]; immediately after that, in
Egypt, he surrenders her. He willingly accepts Sarai's offer of a
handmaid, Hagar, to bear a child Ishmael, in Sarai's place. How
cleverly the narrator leads us with Abram to pin our hopes on Ishmael
as the child of the promise. And how cleverly is the carpet pulled out
from under our feet in Genesis 17, when God finally, perhaps
impatiently, talks specifics: No, I meant that you would father a great
nation through Sarah. And Abraham, as he's now called, is incredulous:
"She's past the age of bearing, Lord." And he laughs. And God is
silent. And in that silence I always imagine that this light goes on:
this click, this awful, sickening light. And Abraham says, O, that
Ishmael might live in your sight! Or something like that. I think I
probably misquoted. "O, that Ishmael might live by your favor"-- sorry,
that's the actual words. But God is determined. Sarah will bear Isaac
and with him God will make an everlasting covenant.</p>

<p>All of this drama through the first five chapters made possible by a
seemingly irrelevant line in 11:30, a sort of throw-away datum in a
family list that one might gloss over: "and Sarai was barren; she had
no child." And that's the power and beauty of biblical narrative. You
have to get yourself into the mindset to read it that way.</p>

<p>A few verses later, when Abram and his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot
and those traveling with them all reach Canaan, God makes an additional
promise. He says in verse 7, "I will assign this land to your
offspring." So in just a few short verses--we've just gone from 12,
we've just gone seven verses now into chapter 12--in just a few short
verses, the writer has established the three-fold promise that
underpins the biblical drama that's about to unfold: the promise of
progeny, of blessing, and of land. And that establishes a narrative
tension for the stories of the patriarchs, but also for the story of
the nation of Israel in subsequent books. Because in the patriarchal
stories, there is this suspenseful vacillation between episodes that
threaten to extinguish God's promises and episodes that reaffirm them.
Israelite matriarchs seem to be a singularly infertile group. The lines
of inheritance defy our expectations: it doesn't seem to go to the
person that we think that it's going to go to. The process by which the
promise is fulfilled is halting and torturous at times. We're going to
look at one example of an episode in which the promise is affirmed--or
confirmed, reaffirmed--and an example of an episode in which the
promise is supremely threatened.</p>

<p>In Genesis 15, God's promise to Abraham is formalized in a ritual
ceremony. God and Abraham are said to "cut" a covenant--that's the verb
that's used in making a covenant--and "covenant" is a central biblical
concept. The Hebrew word for covenant, which I've written over here is
<i>berit</i>. It means vow, promise, perhaps contract, agreement or
pact. Parallels to the biblical covenant have been pointed out by many
Ancient Near Eastern historians and scholars. We have in our Ancient
Near Eastern texts--and we'll come back to these in more detail when we
get into Exodus--we have in our Ancient Near Eastern texts, two types,
two main types of covenant: the suzerainty covenant and the parity
covenant. As you can imagine from the name, a suzerainty covenant is a
covenant in which a superior party, a suzerain, dictates the terms of a
political treaty usually, and an inferior party obeys them. The
arrangement primarily serves the interest of the suzerain, and not the
vassal or the subject. In a parity covenant, you have really two equal
parties who both agree to observe the provisions of some kind of
treaty.</p>

<p>Now, there are four major covenants in the Hebrew Bible. They're
initiated by Yahweh as expressions of divine favor and graciousness.
And two of these appear in Genesis. We've already seen one, the Noahide
covenant; and the Abrahamic covenant, which we're looking at now. Now,
the Noahide covenant in Genesis 9:1-17 is universal in scope. It
encompasses all life on earth. It stresses the sanctity of life and in
this covenant, God promises never to destroy all life again. By
contrast, the Abrahamic covenant is a covenant with a single
individual. So we've gone from a covenant with all of humanity to a
covenant with a single individual. And it looks very much like an
Ancient Near Eastern suzerainty covenant. God appears as a suzerain.
He's making a land grant to a favored subject, which is very often how
these work. And there's an ancient ritual that ratifies the oath. In
general, in this kind of covenant, the parties to the oath would pass
between the split carcass of a sacrificial animal as if to say that
they agree they will suffer the same fate as this animal if they
violate the covenant. In Genesis 15, Abraham cuts sacrificial animals
in two and God, but only God, passes between the two halves.</p>

<p>The striking thing about the Abrahamic covenant is its unilateral
character. Only God seems to be obligated by the covenant, obligated to
fulfill the promise that he's made. Abraham doesn't appear to have any
obligation in return. And so in this case, it is the subject, Abraham,
and not the suzerain, God, who is benefited by this covenant, and
that's a complete reversal of our expectation. Note also that the
biblical writer goes out of his way to provide a moral justification
for this grant of land to Israel. In the biblical writer's view, God is
the owner of the land, and so he is empowered to set conditions or
residency requirements for those who would reside in it, like a
landlord. The current inhabitants of the land are polluting it, filling
it with bloodshed and idolatry. And when the land becomes so polluted,
completely polluted, it will spew out its inhabitants. That process,
God says, isn't complete; so Israel is going to have to wait. The lease
isn't up yet, and the Israelites will have to wait. He says in Genesis
15:16, the iniquity of the Amorites will not be fulfilled until then.
So here, and in other places in the Bible, it's clear that God's
covenant with Israel is not due to any special merit of the Israelites
or favoritism: this is actually said explicitly in Deuteronomy. Rather,
God is seeking replacement tenants who are going to follow the moral
rules of residence that he has established for his land.</p>

<p>Genesis 17 seems to be a second version of the same covenant. This
time, scholars attribute it to P--the Priestly writer, the P source.
There are some notable differences, emphasizing themes that were
important to the Priestly writer. God adds to the promises in Genesis
17 that a line of kings will come forth from Abraham, and then, that
Abraham and his male descendents be circumcised as a perpetual sign of
the covenant. So here there is some obligation for Abraham. "Thus shall
my covenant be marked in your flesh as an everlasting pact" [Gen
17:13]. Failure to circumcise is tantamount to breaking the covenant,
according to the text. Now, circumcision is known in many of the
cultures of the Ancient Near East. It's generally a rite of passage
that was performed at the time of puberty rather than a ritual that was
performed at birth, [or] eight days after birth. So that's unusual in
the Israelite context to have it occur with infants. But as is the case
with so many biblical rituals or institutions or laws, whatever their
original meaning or significance in the ancient world, whether this was
originally a puberty rite or a fertility rite of some kind, the ritual
has been suffused with a new meaning in our texts. So circumcision is
here infused with a new meaning: it becomes a sign of God's eternal
covenant with Abraham and his seed.</p>

<p>These texts are typical of affirmations of God's promise. But
despite them, the patriarchal episodes or stories are peppered with
episodes in which the realization of the promise and the blessing is
threatened. In chapter 12, Abram surrenders his wife Sarai to Pharaoh
in order to advance his position among the Egyptians, plausibly not
knowing that it is Sarai who is supposed to bear the child of God's
promise. As I said, that's left unclear until chapter 17, when God
says: No, no, no, you misunderstood. I meant Sarai. God intervenes,
however, and returns Sarai to Abraham. Sarai's barren state really
casts a shadow over the promise from the very beginning of the story of
Abraham and Sarah. Desperate, Sarah takes advantage of the custom that
is attested in the ancient world of giving her Egyptian handmaid,
Hagar, to Abraham to bear a child in her stead. But Hagar apparently
lords this over her mistress, and an embittered Sarah forces her from
the house. Hagar and her child Ishmael cry out to God in the wilderness
and God assures Hagar that Ishmael, who's regarded by Muslims as the
ancestor of the Arabs and the inheritor of the blessing and the
promise, that Ishmael shall become a great nation too [see note 1]. But
really the greatest threat to the promise comes from God himself, and
that is in Genesis 22 when God tests Abraham with the most horrible of
demands. The child of the promise, Isaac, who was born miraculously to
Sarah when she was no longer of child-bearing age, is to be sacrificed
to God by Abraham's own hand. And the story of the binding of Isaac is
one of the most powerful, most riveting stories not only in the Bible
but, some have claimed, in all of world literature.</p>

<p>The story is a marvelous exemplar of the biblical narrator's
literary skill and artistry. This week's assigned reading includes
selections from Robert Alter's book, <i>The Art of Biblical
Narrative</i>, which I heartily recommend to read in its entirety.
Alter describes the extreme economy of biblical narrative, economy in
the description of physical settings and character as well as speech.
Rarely does the narrator comment on or explain a character's actions or
thoughts or motives. There's only the barest minimum of dialogue. And
on the few occasions that the Bible will violate this principle of
verbal economy--for example if two characters converse at length--you
can be sure it's significant. You'll want to pay extra attention. The
biblical narrator's concealing of details and the motives of the
characters, God and Abraham and Isaac, leads to ambiguity, and the
possibility of very many interpretations. And that is a striking
characteristic of biblical prose: its suppression of detail, its terse,
laconic style. That makes the little that <i>is</i> given so powerful,
so "fraught with background" to use the phrase of Eric Auerbach, whose
article you are also to read this week. Auerbach contrasts the literary
style of Homer with the biblical writer's style specifically in
connection with the story of Genesis 22.</p>

<p>The ambiguities and the indeterminacy of this story make it one of
the most interpreted texts of all time. Why is God testing Abraham?
Does God really desire such a sacrifice? What is Abraham thinking and
feeling as he walks--for three days, already--walks with his son,
bearing the wood and the fire for the sacrifice? Does he fully intend
to obey this command, to annul the covenantal promise with his own
hand? Or does he trust in God to intervene? Or is this a paradox of
faith? Does Abraham intend faithfully to obey, all the while trusting
faithfully that God's promise will nevertheless be fulfilled? What's
Isaac thinking? Does he understand what is happening? How old is he? Is
this a little boy or a grown man? Is he prepared to obey? He sees the
wood and the firestone in his father's hand. Clearly a sacrifice is
planned. He's got three days to figure that out. He asks his father:
Where is the sheep for the burnt offering? Does he know the answer even
as he asks? Does he hear the double entendre in his father's very
simple and solemn reply, which in the unpunctuated Hebrew might be
read, "The lord will provide the sheep for the offering: my son." Does
he struggle when he's bound? Does he acquiesce?</p>

<p>The beauty of the narrative is its sheer economy. It offers so
little that we as readers are forced to imagine the innumerable
possibilities. We play out the drama in countless ways, with an Abraham
who's reluctant and an Isaac who's ignorant. Or an Abraham who's eager
to serve his God to the point of sacrificing his own son, and an Isaac
who willingly bares his neck to the knife. Read the story one verse,
one phrase, one word at a time. There are so few words that you can be
sure that they were chosen with care. You'll be looking at Genesis 22
closely in your section discussions. And as you read the story,
remember its larger context: God's promise to make Abraham the father
of a great people through his son, Isaac. It's this context, this
promise, that gives the story its special power and pathos.</p>

<p>But of course the story can be contextualized in a number of
different ways. For example, one can read the story in its historical
context of child sacrifice in the Ancient Near East. Although child
sacrifice was adamantly condemned in various later layers of the Bible,
there's plenty of evidence that it was probably practiced in different
quarters throughout the period of the monarchy. Does Genesis 22 assume
or reject the practice of child sacrifice? Some scholars argue that a
core story promoting child sacrifice has been edited so as to serve as
a polemic against child sacrifice now in its final form. Do you think
so? Can you see the seams and feel the narrative tensions that would
support such a claim? Does the story pull in more than one
direction?</p>

<p>Or we can read the story in its immediate literary context. Abraham
has just permitted the expulsion of Ishmael, the only beloved son of
Hagar. And now God demands that he sacrifice his beloved son. What
might he be trying to teach Abraham? Is this a trial in the sense of a
test or a trial in the sense of a punishment? The Hebrew term can
tolerate both meanings.</p>

<p>Or Genesis 22 can be contextualized another way. And at this point,
we need to backtrack a little bit to the story of Sodom and Gomorrah,
which is in Genesis 18 and 19, to contextualize the story a little bit,
in terms of Abraham's character development. In the story of Sodom and
Gomorrah, in Genesis 18 and 19, Yahweh tells Abraham of his plan to
investigate reports of the wickedness of the city, the Canaanite city
of Sodom--its violence, its cruelty to strangers--and to destroy it.
And Abraham's reaction comes as something of a surprise. He objects to
the plan, and he starts to argue with God. "Will you sweep away the
innocent along with the guilty? Shall not the judge of all the earth
deal justly?" That's in Genesis 18:23-25. The question is of course
rhetorical. Abraham is evidently quite confident that God would not act
unjustly, would not destroy the innocent along with the wicked. Indeed,
Abraham is banking on the fact that God is merciful and will overlook
evil for the sake of righteous individuals. And so Abraham haggles with
God for the lives of the innocent:</p>

<blockquote>"...Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?" And
the Lord answered, "If I find within the city of Sodom fifty innocent
ones, I will forgive the whole place for their sake." Abraham spoke up,
saying, "Here I venture to speak to my Lord, I who am but dust and
ashes: What if the fifty innocent should lack five? Will You destroy
the whole city for want of the five?" And He answered, "I will not
destroy if I find forty-five there." But he spoke to Him again, and
said, "What if forty should be found there?" And He answered, "I will
not do it, for the sake of the forty." And he said, "Let not my Lord be
angry if I go on: What if thirty should be found there?"</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And in this way, Abraham manages to whittle the number down to ten:
"And God answers, 'I will not destroy for the sake of the ten.'"</p>

<p>But ten innocent men are not found. The narrator makes that very
clear. He takes pains to point out that the mob that comes to abuse the
two divine visitors includes all the people to the last man: very clear
statement. So Sodom and its four sister cities of the plain, around the
Dead Sea, are destroyed. But out of consideration for Abraham,
Abraham's nephew Lot is saved. Genesis 19:29: "God was mindful of
Abraham and removed Lot from the midst of the upheaval." Now, this text
is often identified as the source for the doctrine of the merit of the
righteous, which is the idea that someone who is not righteous is
spared for the sake of, or on account of, the accrued merit of one who
is righteous. So Lot himself is no prize, but he is spared on Abraham's
account. This is an idea that will have repercussions in later biblical
thought.</p>

<p>In this story, we see Abraham rising to the defense of a thoroughly
wicked and reprehensible group of people, arguing quite pointedly that
the innocent should never be wantonly destroyed. Can this be the same
Abraham who a few chapters later, when told to slaughter his only son,
his perfectly innocent and presumably deeply loved son, not only makes
no objection, but rises early in the morning to get started on the long
journey to the sacrificial site? What are we to make of the
juxtaposition of these two stories? Which represents behavior more
desirable to God?</p>

<p>Before leaving this story, I just want to make two quick comments.
First, I've included in your reading packet, and it's uploaded on the
[Yale College course] website, a very interesting article by a writer
who relates her efforts since childhood to understand why Lot's wife
should have been turned into a pillar of salt as punishment for looking
back as she fled from her burning home [Goldstein 1994, 3-12]. It's not
a biblical scholar, but someone who's simply reacting to the text. Was
this, in fact, a punishment, or was it a mercy? Second, the story of
Sodom and Gomorrah has often been cited as a biblical condemnation of
homosexuality, as if the Sodomites were condemned to destruction
because of homosexual behavior. In fact the very terms "sodomy" and
"sodomize" represent this interpretation. But the idea that the
fundamental sin of Sodom was homosexual behavior is not present in the
Hebrew Bible. It appears only in later documents. It's found in the
Christian New Testament, in the book of Jude 7:2; the book of Peter
2:6-10; and subsequent interpretations. The Sodomites, like the
generation of the Flood, stand condemned by the "outcry against them,"
a particular Hebrew word that's used to refer to outcry. It's a term
that's generally associated with the appeal of victims of violent
oppression, bloodshed, injustice. God hears this outcry of victims,
against the Sodomites: the Sodomites' violation of the unwritten desert
law of hospitality to strangers, their violent desire to abuse and gang
rape the strangers that they should have been sheltering. This is
merely one instance of a pattern of violent brutality.</p>

<p>Now, Isaac, who is the child of God's promise to Abraham, is often
described as the most invisible of the patriarchs or the most passive
of the patriarchs. Perhaps his passive acceptance of his father's
effort to sacrifice him serves as the key to the biblical narrator's
perception of his character. By contrast, his wife Rebekah is often
described as the most determined and energetic of the matriarchs. She
runs to extend hospitality to a stranger. She quickly draws water for
him. She quickly draws water for his camels and waters them all. She
seems to run everywhere, and she does all this not knowing that the man
she greets is the servant of Abraham who has come to seek a wife for
his master's son, Isaac. Rebekah herself personally, accepts the offer
of an unknown bridegroom in a far away land and overrides the urgings
of her mother and her brother to delay her departure. No, she says, I'm
ready to go. I'll go now. There's a very moving conclusion to the
betrothal story. We read in Genesis 24:67 that Isaac brought Rebekah
"into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he took Rebekah as his wife.
Isaac loved her and thus found comfort after his mother's death."</p>

<p>But like the other matriarchs, Rebekah is barren. So Isaac pleads
with the lord for a child on her behalf. And Rebekah becomes pregnant
with twins. The older child is Esau--Esau will be the father of the
Edomites--and the younger is Jacob, who will be the father of the
Israelites. Now, Jacob is the most fully developed, the most colorful
and the most complex of the patriarchs. Jacob has long been identified
by commentators as the classic trickster, a type that we know from
folklore. Marc Brettler has described the Jacob stories as a kind of
morality tale, the main message of which is "trick and you shall be
tricked" [Brettler 2005, 51]. Jacob tricks his brother out of his
birthright, and in turn is tricked by his brother-in-law, his wife and
later his own sons. How much of Jacob's trickery is really necessary?
After all, Rebekah, who suffers tremendous pain during her pregnancy,
is told by God that the twins who are fighting and struggling for
priority in her womb will become two nations, the older of which will
serve the younger. That happens in Genesis 25:23. "Two nations are in
your womb; two separate peoples shall issue from your body; one people
shall be mightier than the other; and the older shall serve the
younger." And indeed, the real life nations of Israel and Edom were
long-time enemies--Esau is the father of the Edomites according to the
biblical texts--and for a time, Edom was subjugated by Israel,
according to the biblical texts, under King David.</p>

<p>Some scholars, like Nahum Sarna have argued that this announcement,
that the older shall serve the younger is the narrator's way of
establishing for the reader that the younger child, Jacob, is the son
who will inherit the divine blessing, and that that then raises serious
questions about Rebekah and Jacob's morally dubious efforts to wrest
the blessing and birthright from Esau. Are we supposed to be comforted
by the fact that they are fulfilling a divine plan? Are we supposed to
conclude that it's alright to fulfill a divine plan by any means, fair
or foul? Or are we to conclude, as Sarna and others suggest, that
Jacob's possession of the birthright was predetermined, it was
disengaged from all of his acts of trickery? And if so, then Jacob's
efforts are indicative of a deceitful and narcissistic personality? He
takes advantage of Esau's hunger, offering him a pot of lentil stew in
exchange for the birthright. He and Rebekah plot to deceive Isaac in
his dotage into bestowing the blessing of the firstborn on Jacob
instead of Esau. So perhaps by informing us that Jacob had been chosen
from the womb, the narrator is able to paint a portrait of Jacob at
this stage in his life as grasping and faithless: a great contrast to
his grandfather, Abraham.</p>

<p>Now, Jacob's poor treatment of his brother, Esau, earns him Esau's
enmity and Jacob finds it expedient to leave Canaan and remain at the
home of his mother's brother, Laban. On his way east, back to
Mesopotamia from Canaan, where Laban resides, in Mesopotamia, Jacob has
an encounter with God. At a place called Luz, Jacob lies down to sleep,
resting his head on a stone. And he has a dream in which he sees a
ladder. The ladder's feet are on the earth, it reaches to heaven and
there are angels ascending and descending on the ladder. In the dream,
God appears to Jacob and reaffirms the Abrahamic or patriarchal
covenant. He promises land, posterity and in addition, Jacob's own
safety, his own personal safety until he returns to the land of Israel.
Jacob is stunned: we read in Genesis 28:16-17: "Jacob awoke from his
sleep and said, 'Surely the Lord is [present] in this place; and I did
not know it.' / Shaken, he said, 'How awesome is this place! This is
none other than the abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven.'"
The stone that served as his pillow, he then sets up as a cultic
pillar, some sort of memorial stone. He sanctifies the stone with oil
and he renames the site Bethel, <i>Beyt El</i>, which means the house
of God.</p>

<p>But it's significant that despite this direct vision, Jacob, so
unlike Abraham, is still reluctant to rely on God and his promise. And
he makes a conditional vow:</p>

<blockquote>If God remains with me, if He protects me on this journey
that I am making, and gives me bread to eat and clothing to wear, and
if I return safe to my father's house--the Lord shall be my God. And
this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, shall be God's abode; and
of all that You give me, I will set aside a tithe for You.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>So where once God had tested Abraham, it seems now that Jacob is
almost testing God. If you can do all this, fine: you can be my
God.</p>

<p>Well, Jacob spends some 14 years in the household of his uncle, his
mother's brother, Laban. And Jacob meets Laban's two daughters: Leah is
the elder daughter and Rachel is the younger. And he soon loves Rachel.
He agrees to serve Laban for seven years for the hand of the younger
daughter Rachel. When the seven years pass, Laban deceives Jacob and
gives him the elder daughter, Leah. Jacob, the trickster, is furious at
having been tricked himself, and in much the same way--an older and a
younger sibling, one disguised as the other or wearing the covering of
the other, just as he tricked his own father. But he is willing to give
seven years more service for Rachel. Rachel, Leah, and their two
handmaidens will conceive one daughter and 12 sons, from whom will come
the 12 tribes of Israel. But it's the two sons of Rachel, the beloved
wife, the two sons of Rachel, Joseph and Benjamin, who are the most
beloved to Jacob.</p>

<p>Jacob determines finally to leave Laban and return to Canaan.
There's one final remarkable incident in Jacob's life that occurs on
his return journey. It's an incident that most readers associate with a
significant transformation in his character, and that is Jacob's
nighttime struggle with a mysterious figure, who in some way is
representative of God. This struggle occurs as he is about to cross the
river Jabbok and reconcile himself with his former rival and enemy,
Esau. Jacob has sent everyone on ahead: his wives, his children, his
household, his possessions. He's standing alone at the river. And we
read, Genesis 32:25-33.:</p>

<blockquote>… a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn. When he
saw that he had not prevailed against him, he wrenched Jacob's hip at
its socket, so that the socket of his hip was strained as he wrestled
with him. Then he said, "Let me go, for dawn is breaking." But he
answered, "I will not let you go, unless you bless me." Said the other,
"What is your name?" He replied, "Jacob." Said he, "Your name shall no
longer be Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and men, and
have prevailed." Jacob asked, "Pray tell me your name." But he said,
"You must not ask my name!" And he took leave of him there. So Jacob
named the place Peniel, meaning, "I have seen a divine being face to
face, yet my life has been preserved." The sun rose upon him as he
passed Peniel, limping on his hip.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Many scholars, Michael Coogan and others, see this story as an
Israelite adaptation of popular stories of river gods who threaten
those who wish to cross a river, or trolls or ogres who guard rivers
and have to be defeated by a hero, making the river safe to cross. In
its Israelite version, however, this story is historicized. It serves
an etiological function. It's associated with one particular character
at a historical time and it serves to explain why the Israelites
abstained from eating the sciatic nerve of an animal even to this day.
We also learn how Peniel gets its name. We learn how Israel gets his
name. Names are an important theme of this story. In the biblical
context, names encapsulate the essence of their bearer. Naming
something or knowing the name of something gives one control over, or
power over, that thing. And that's why the stranger will not reveal his
name to Jacob. It would give Jacob power over him.</p>

<p>Jacob's own name is the occasion for some punning in this story. His
name is built on this root Y.'.Q.B: <i>Ya-'a-qov</i> It means to
supplant or uproot. He emerges from the womb grasping his brother's
heel. '<i>aqev</i> here [on the board], the word for "heel," is based
on that root. It's part of his effort to supplant Esau right at birth,
and he continues that effort at supplanting through his early life. The
writer makes that explicit in Genesis 27:36 when Esau cries out, "Was
he then named <i>Ya'aqov</i> that he might supplant me these two
times?" Yes. And in this chapter, Jacob <i>wrestles</i>. The word for
wrestle is built on this root, just switching two letters [Y.'.B.Q]. He
wrestles with the mysterious, divine being at the Jabbok [Y.B.Q.]
river. So you see all of this punning with the name. Jacob's very name
hints at and foreshadows the struggling, the wrestling, the trickery
that are the major themes of his life. But his striving has reached a
climax here. And so the angel names him <i>Yisra'el,</i> Israel, which
means he who has striven with God. Because as the stranger says, he has
striven and wrestled all his life with men, particularly his brother,
and now with God. <i>El</i> means god. It's the name of the chief god
of the pantheon of Canaan. <i>Yisra'el</i>, he who has struggled with
God. We'll talk about the way in which the change of name means a
change of character, change of essence for the patriarch when we
return.</p>
