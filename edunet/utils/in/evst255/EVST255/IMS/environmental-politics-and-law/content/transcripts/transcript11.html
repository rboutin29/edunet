<p><b>Professor John Wargo</b>: Okay, let's start
in. Got a fairly large agenda today. And I wanted to remind you that next week,
we're moving on to air quality. So check your syllabus and read the material
for section next week. </p>
<p>And today I want to
talk about two principles in law, one being preemption and the other being
defamation, and to give you a couple of case histories. And I'm going to start
out talking about <i>Bates v. Dow</i>. And then I want to talk about two cases,
one, product disparagement, and the other one is known as the Alar case. And
another is a case that was brought by the Texas Cattlemen's Association against
Oprah Winfrey. And I'll show you a couple of video clips of that. </p>
<p>First of all,
preemption has its origin in the Constitution, within the supremacy clause that
states, &quot;This Constitution and the laws of the U.S. shall be the supreme
law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby.&quot; So
that within air quality law, within pesticide management law, within
pharmaceutical law, tobacco law, occupational law, states are prohibited from
adopting certain standards that are different than the federal government. And
the purpose behind this is not to create a patchwork quilt that is really
comprised of non-uniform standards so that when corporations wish to trade
goods or provide services across state boundaries, they basically have the
expectations. It's often applied to situations that are risky or products that are
risky. And the failure to warn is often a key question. And we'll raise that in
the case today. </p>
<p>With respect to
pesticides, Congress traditionally deferred to states to regulate threats to
health and safety. But since 1970, it's exercised its power to preempt state or
local regulation in a number of areas, particularly with respect to warning
labels on pesticides. So there are a variety of theories of damage recovery. So
if you imagine that say someone comes to your home and promises to give you a
green lawn by applying fertilizers and insecticides, and all of a sudden you
notice an acrid taste in your well water, and also your children start to feel
awkward or strange. And you find out that the chemicals that were applied were
neurotoxic substances. And what are your rights? Basically, you could argue
that-- we have percussion section out there on the street, throwing I think
rocks or bricks into one of these big metal barrels. So I apologize for that.
So you can imagine yourself in a situation where you conclude that federal law
didn't protect you against that. You feel like you've been damaged. It's going
to cost you money to either drill a new well or to put infiltration equipment.
And what about the health effects on your family? </p>
<p>So there are a variety
of theories of damage recovery. And one is that the failure to warn provides a
justification for seeking recovery of damages. So remember what I argued about
the difficulty that most people have in understanding warning labels, the
difficulty of taking complicated scientific information and reducing it in a
way that would make it intelligible and make you capable of knowing how you
should behave in order to prevent risk. For example, should you be responsible
to know that you have sandy soils and that your well is a shallow well, and
it's an old well, and the casing is cracked? I mean, are you really responsible
to know that? Should that information be on a warning label? </p>
<p>Negligence is another
theory for recovery. So was the product made in a negligent way or was it used
in a negligent way? How about design defects? Listening to <i>Good Morning
America</i> today, I was intrigued by litigation that is growing, class action
suits against Toyota because of their accelerator pad catching, or brake
defects. So some defect in production or design that leads to a higher level,
higher concentration of risk or hazard and subsequent damage. </p>
<p>How about failure to
disclose incident reports? So that Dow Chemical Company was fined nearly
$800,000 because it had been reported to Dow by a variety of families that they
felt that they had medical problems that were associated with using their
products. And they were required under federal pesticide law to report those
incidents back to the Environmental Protection Agency, and they did not do so
within the time limit, there was a significant delay. So the failure to
disclose incident reports. And again, with the auto defects that we're
witnessing in the press and in the showrooms today, the same issue applies. So
when did the corporation know that the pedals stuck or that the brake system
was not working correctly? </p>
<p>So the failure to
report back to government agencies that have regulatory responsibilities,
whether it's pharmaceuticals or cars or pesticides or cosmetics or foods, these
generally carry significant penalties. And because of preemption that's built
into pesticide law and air quality law, et cetera, states have often denied
access to courts to use these theories of recovery to secure compensation. So
the state courts have often not agreed to hear the cases. </p>
<p>This is why <i>Bates
v. Dow</i> is so important. Bates is a case in which twenty-nine peanut growers
in Texas alleged that Dow AgroSciences had produced a chemical called Strong
Arm. Strong Arm, they claimed damaged their peanut plants back in the year
2000. And the pesticide label itself claimed that &quot;Use of Strong Arm is
recommended in all areas where peanuts are grown.&quot; Now, when it was used
in the Texas peanut farmland, where the soils exceeded a pH of seven point two,
it damaged both the peanut crop, and it failed to control the weeds. So the
activity of this chemical is mediated by the acidity of the soil. And by 2001,
EPA had approved a new label for the chemical, including a new warning,
&quot;Do not apply Strong Arm to soils with a pH of seven point two or greater.&quot;
So this case was decided in 2005. This label was in force for four years before
the decision date. </p>
<p>So eventually, the
case wound its way up to the Supreme Court. And this is quite a feat. In many
instances, claims that are brought in state courts do not make their way up to
the Supreme Court. It can often take decades or even a half a century before a
case is believed to be appropriate for judicial review by the highest court in
the country. So they found that &quot;Congress surely would have expressed its
intent more clearly of it had meant to deprive injured parties of a
long-available form of compensation. Moreover, this history emphasizes the
importance of providing an incentive to manufacturers to use the utmost care in
distributing inherently dangerous items.&quot; In other words, the Supreme
Court was looking at these lawsuits to seek recovery as really a last resort.
So it represents the failure of federal law, it represents the failure of state
law or local law to offer sufficient environmental protection or protection of
public health. </p>
<p>So what's a damaged
party to do? What are you going to do if you've been damaged? Well, you
probably would consider litigation. So the Supreme Court continued, &quot;It
seems unlikely that Congress considered a relatively obscure provision like
Section 136VB (which is the preemption clause) to give pesticide manufacturers
virtual immunity from certain forms of tort liability. And we've been pointed
to no evidence that such tort suits led to a crazy quilt of FIFRA (federal
pesticide law standards) or otherwise created any real hardship for
manufacturers or EPA.&quot; So the argument that you would have an uneven
regulatory playing field among the states had no substance to it, or that the manufacturers
would be damaged significantly by these claims, because they're expensive,
they're time consuming, and few people actually have the resources or capacity
to bring the lawsuits. </p>
<p>So central questions
today really will involve a question of freedom of speech and when is it
appropriate to limit speech about environmental and health hazards,
intellectual property rights. Who should own the right to knowledge of risk?
Should corporations be capable of holding that as a secret? Or should they be
obligated to disclose that to the public in the form of a warning label or a
disclosure of an incident report? What should the standard of proof be? And how
should the falsity of a statement be judged? The falsity of a statement on a
label or the falsity of a statement made by a party that is challenging a
corporation that they were damaged by exposure to their product? And where
should the burden of proof lie? Should the burden of proof lie with the
plaintiff to prove the falsity of criticism, or the defendant to prove truth of
criticism? </p>
<p>And to explore this
area of product disparagement more fully, I want you to consider one case. This
is a case of a chemical known as Alar that you probably did not experience. But
it was in wide use in the United States and in different parts of the world
back in the 1980s and early 1990s, and it was used on apples. And it was used
on apple orchards basically to cause stem thickening, so it would hold the
apple on the tree longer and it would keep the apple from falling down and getting
bruised. So it would maintain the commercial quality and the grade of the
apple. And it would also cause uniform ripening. Uniform ripening is important,
because you don't want part of a tree, perhaps that's facing the sunshine, to
have apples that are ripe and then all the apples that are on the north side of
the tree in more shade that would remain green. So it provided economic
advantage to orchard owners in a variety of ways. </p>
<p>This is a systemic
compound, which is interesting. It means that it's absorbed up through the
plant roots itself into the plant tissue. So you may think that some residues
are only on the surface of a fruit or a vegetable and if you peel it or if you
wash it, you could get rid of it. Here's an example of a compound that that would
not be helpful for. </p>
<p>It's not easy to
detect. When this chemical was being reviewed and became a public target for
criticism of its manufacturer, I went up to the state of Massachusetts, because
the state of Massachusetts was trying to figure out if they were going to ban
the compound, as it was detected increasingly in foods. And I went to their
laboratories, their state laboratories, and they had not even developed a
detection method yet. Speaking to their analytic chemists, they didn't even
know how to find this in foods. </p>
<p>So think about that
for a minute. What that means is that the government approved the use of a
chemical on certain crops when it knew that there was no accepted method for
detecting it in the food or in processed forms of the food or in water supplies
if it happened to contaminate water supplies. So that's quite curious and it
might give you some ideas about prior requirements before introducing new
technologies. </p>
<p>So it has an unusual
characteristic. It produces unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, UDMH, which is
also a space shuttle rocket fuel, but only under conditions where the chemical
is heated. Now where would food be heated? Well, it's commonly heated when it's
processed or when it's pasteurized. So when you take an apple and you grind it
up and you squeeze all the juice out of it to make apple juice, it's commonly
heated up for the purposes of killing bacteria and protecting human health. </p>
<p>Apple juice in the
1980s was also exploding into the marketplace, in part because of different
packaging technologies. So it used to be available in large glass bottles, but
the advent of juice boxes so that children would take these flavored juices to
school on a routine basis in really small cardboard and plastic containers, it
caused apple juice consumption to skyrocket. So that apple juice, within a
matter of a decade, became one of the more heavily consumed foods by young
children. </p>
<p>So it was introduced
by Uniroyal in 1966 and registered by the Department of Agriculture, because
EPA wasn't in existence until 1970. And in 1973, it was found to produce cancer
in mice. Between 1977 and '78, the National Cancer Institute found that that
study was credible, and they conducted their own studies that found
carcinogenic effects in animals, raising the question how should we look at
data from animal testing? And what should we infer from that about human health
risk? Well, during conservative political administrations, we've tended as a
society not to worry too much about these low level cancer risks in the food
supply. But remember that at this point in time, the Delaney Clause in the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was in place that had what was called the <i>de
minimis</i> risk standard built into it. So it also had the Food and Drug
Administration that was interpreting the <i>de minimis</i> standard to allow
low levels of risk in the food supply. </p>
<p>So EPA concluded
eventually in 1980 that it was carcinogenic and then negotiated with Uniroyal
for several years, and that produced no action. In 1985, they found that both Alar,
which is the parent compound and the metabolite, the UDMH, was a &quot;probable
human&quot; carcinogen. So this is the next step up in the level of concern. It's
not just an animal carcinogen--it's &quot;probable human.&quot; The next step up, by the
way, is &quot;known human carcinogen.&quot; And there are more than a hundred now
compounds that are characterized as known human carcinogens, such as benzene
and 1,3-butadiene, which exists in diesel exhaust and other combustion
situations, such as in wood smoke, or virtually any time fossil fuel is being
combusted. And in 1985, some feedback from their own scientific advisory panel
raised questions about the quality of the data. Can you actually calculate a
cancer risk? </p>
<p>So what is the
threat? And what can publicly be stated about that threat? Well, the Natural
Resources Defense Council, one of our largest environmental groups, conducted
their own analysis of kids' exposure, recognizing that kids were eating a lot
of apples and applesauce and drinking a lot of apple juice. It was a very
common drink to be served to infants in place of infant formula or milk. And
has the EPA violated the public trust? So let me see if I can get this going. </p>
<p>This is a <i>60
Minutes </i>report that was prepared on this controversy. So that the Natural
Resources Defense Council brought their study to <i>60 Minutes</i> and asked
them, &quot;Would you like to release this information on your show?&quot; And
the answer was yes. </p>
<p><b>Ed Bradley [on
video]:</b>
[inaudible] --in our food supply was a substance sprayed on
apples to keep them on the trees longer and make them look better. That's the
conclusion of a number of scientific experts. And who is most at risk?
Children, who may someday develop cancer from this one chemical called
daminozide. Daminozide, which has been sprayed on apples for more than twenty
years, breaks down into another chemical called UDMH. The EPA's acting
administrator, Dr. Jack Moore, acknowledged that the EPA has known about the
cancer risk for sixteen years.</p>
<p><b>Jack Moore [on
video]: </b>There's
no question if it was a new chemical not yet on the market and it was brought
to the EPA to be evaluated, that it would not get on the market, based on the
data that was available. </p>
<p><b>Ed Bradley [on
video]:</b>
Dr. Moore, I can't understand that. I mean, you're telling me something that if
this stuff came into you just today and it was brand new, it wouldn't get on
the market. But because it's already out there, we can keep using it? That
doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p><b>Jack Moore [on
video]:<i> </i></b>You've
just identified one of the paradoxes of the statute. What if a pesticide gets
its license, gets its registration, is on the market, despite what everybody
might think, the burden of carrying unreasonable risk finding basically goes
onto the government. All right? </p>
<p><b>Ed Bradley [on
video]:</b>
But you see, a lot of these chemicals got on the market when we didn't know
that they were cancer-causing agents, and they're on the market now. And we
know that they do cause cancer. But you say we can't take them off because
they're already on the market and they went on the market when we didn't know
they caused cancer. </p>
<p><b>Jack Moore [on
video]: </b>That's
the paradox of statute.</p>
<p><b>Ed Bradley [on
video]: </b>[inaudible]
Is it fair to say then, Dr. Moore, that there are laws on the books that are
putting us, particularly our children, at risk? </p>
<p><b>Jack Moore [on
video]: </b>Could
be. Could be. </p>
<p><b>Ed Bradley [on
video]: </b>While
Dr. Moore blames a law which requires him to balance the health risks to the
public against the economic benefits to the growers, Congressman Jerry Sikorsky
blames the EPA.</p>
<p><b>Jerry Sikorsky [on
video]: </b>There
are two laws. One is the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that says quite clearly if
this chemical causes tumor in laboratory animals, not malignant tumors, any
kind of tumors, it's supposed to be pulled off the market. </p>
<p><b>Ed Bradley [on
video]: </b>Jack
Moore, the deputy administrator of the EPA, says that he'd like to take it off
the market, but he's afraid that the manufacturer, Uniroyal, that makes this
chemical, could successfully sue the EPA.</p>
<p><b>Jerry Sikorsky [on
video]: </b>So
let them sue. That's his job. He's with the Environmental Protection Agency. Go
to a cancer ward at any children's hospital in this country, see these bald,
wasting away kids, and then make a decision as to whether the risks balance
over the benefits. </p>
<p><b>Ed Bradley [on video]</b>: Kids are at a high
risk from UDMH because they drink so much apple juice. The average preschooler
drinks eighteen times more apple juice than his or her mother. If those apples
were treated with daminozide, the cancer risk is perilously high. Janet
Hathaway is the senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
<p><b>Janet Hathaway [on
video]</b>:
What we're talking about is a cancer-causing agent used on food that EPA knows
is going to cause cancer for thousands of children over their lifetime.</p>
<p><b>Ed Bradley [on video]</b>: Uniroyal Chemical,
which makes daminozide under the trade name Alar, declined to be interviewed
for this report. But in a letter, they said, &quot;Any risk from daminozide or
UDMH, if it exists, is negligible.&quot; Nonetheless, preliminary results from
Uniroyal's own study already show high levels of cancer in laboratory animals.
Janet Hathaway's organization, the Natural Resources Defense Council, has just
completed the most careful study yet on the effect of daminozide and seven other
cancer causing pesticides in the food children eat. </p>
<p><b>Janet Hathaway [on
video]</b>:
Just from these eight pesticides what we're finding is that the risk of
developing cancer is approximately 250 times what EPA says is an acceptable
level of cancer in a population. </p>
<p><b>Ed Bradley [on video]</b>: Two hundred and
fifty times?</p>
<p><b>Janet Hathaway [on
video]</b>:
That's right. What that means is that over a lifetime, one child out of every
4,000 or so of our preschoolers will develop cancer just from these eight
pesticides.</p>
<p><b>Ed Bradley [on video]</b>: And EPA says
acceptable limit is one out of?</p>
<p><b>Janet Hathaway [on
video]</b>:
One out of a million they say is acceptable. </p>
<p><b>Ed Bradley [on video]</b>: Are they scaring
people needlessly? Are they fear mongers? </p>
<p><b>Jack Moore [on video]</b>: Well, there's no
question that if the risk is greater than the one in a million calculation,
it's a cause for concern to disease.</p>
<p><b>Ed Bradley [on video]</b>: You've had a chance
to look at the NRDC study. It says children are being bombarded with a
pesticide risk several hundred times greater than what the agency says is
acceptable.</p>
<p><b>Jack Moore [on video]</b>: Risk unacceptable,
yet magnitude of risk is less by our calculation than [inaudible]
</p>
<p><b>Ed Bradley [on video]</b>: Dr. John Grave a
professor of--</p>
<p><b>Professor John Wargo:
</b>I'm sorry,
this will take just one second. [pause] </p>
<p>So think about what
Janet Hathaway, the senior attorney just said. &quot;Over a lifetime, one child
out of every 4,000 or so of our preschoolers will develop cancer from just
these eight pesticides.&quot; Think about the wording, the phrasing very
carefully. This is quantitative risk assessment. It's loaded with uncertainty
from many different sources. You're forced to infer from animal evidence.
You're forced to understand the pattern of exposure, how the compound might
behave inside the human body. </p>
<p>Then she said,
&quot;Alar, the most potent cancer causing agent in our food supply, is a
substance sprayed on apples to keep them on the trees longer...And what we're
talking about is a cancer-causing agent used on food that EPA knows is going to
cause cancer for thousands of children over their lifetime.&quot; These are
statements of certainty that caused widespread fear in the population. Senator
Joe Lieberman spoke to me during this situation. And he said he walked
immediately, after watching <i>60 Minutes</i>, over to his refrigerator. He
took out his jar of apple juice and dumped it down the drain and started making
phone calls. This happened all over the country as millions of people had
witnessed this. Jack Moore, who you saw, the acting EPA administrator, said
that the evidence, yes, that he relied upon was suitable for a decision to say
that Alar indeed was a carcinogen. </p>
<p>And the media
reaction was really quite striking. All of the major media outlets picked this
story up, <i>Newsweek</i>, et cetera. Donahue, on <i>The Donahue Show</i>, he
said &quot;Don't look now, but we're poisoning our kids.&quot; The consumer
reaction was really quite rapid and devastating for the apple industry. Apple
product sales dropped thirty percent in a month, particularly on apple juice.
School boards in New York and Virginia and California stopped serving apples in
their lunch programs. Growers claimed losses of $250 million and they engaged
in a lawsuit against both <i>60 Minutes </i>as well as the Natural Resources
Defense Council. Within a matter of six months, the economic concerns were so
high that the industry itself was begging EPA to please regulate and prohibit
the use of this chemical. </p>
<p>Now, that's really
quite striking. So that you've got really kind of a very different type of regulatory
theory here. What is regulation doing? It's really providing a sense of
legitimacy to manufacturers of different kinds of products so that if you know
that a chemical or a product, it could be a food, it could be a car. If you
know that it's been reviewed by a regulatory agency, that act of regulation
really constitutes certification of that product's utility and also its safety
in the marketplace. So the fact that the growers and the grocery stores and
even Uniroyal asked EPA to move quickly so that the economic damage would be
limited and consumer confidence could be restored, particularly because this
product was not used on all apple products. So it really is a form of symbolic
politics, which I think is quite striking. So that regardless of whether or not
the regulations are health protective, they create a sense of legitimacy of
products and services in the marketplace so that in one sense, our corporations
need these regulations so that they create consumer confidence. </p>
<p>So the Washington apple
growers, there are 4,700 of them, claimed that well, there was no evidence
linking Alar to human cancer and the animal evidence was insufficient, and they
called this a product disparagement or a trade libel case. And in this
situation, the growers faced the burden of proof. So they needed to prove that
the statements were made knowingly to be false, the statements were
deliberately made to induce monetary damage. </p>
<p>And this is a form of
trade libel law, defamation. So there are several forms of libel, slander, and
sedition. Libel, the definition is defamation through print materials. Slander
is oral defamation. In the English common law tradition, libel in private
enterprise generally found favorably to plaintiffs. And sedition, you'll
recall, is any political criticism that tended to diminish respect for
government, laws, and public officials. The common law definition of libel was
decided by a famous court case in 1933. It covers &quot;all written communications
that tend to expose one to public hatred, shame, obloquy, contumely, odium,
contempt, ridicule, aversion, ostracism, degradation, or disgrace, and to
induce an evil opinion of one in the minds of right-thinking persons and to
deprive one of their confidence and friendly intercourse in society.&quot;</p>
<p>Well in this case,
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found on the absence of human studies that &quot;The
fact that there had been no studies conducted specifically on the cancer risks
to children form daminozide, one of the arguments on the part of the industry,
does nothing to disprove the conclusion that if children consume more of a
carcinogenic substance than do adults, they are at higher risk for contracting
cancer.&quot; So what's interesting about this comment by the appellate court
is that they're not looking for proof that this chemical caused cancer in
children. They're looking for elevated cancer risk. And on the falsity of the
statements, a product disparagement plaintiff has the burden of proving the
falsity [of the claim]. And this statement refers to individuals, not to any
overall message. And if a jury were given the task of interpreting the
uncertainty of a message, it raises the specter of a chilling effect on speech.
So think about the relationship between this type of a court case and the
freedom of the individual to express themselves or express their opinion about
the dangers of different products or human behaviors. </p>
<p>So this case was
decided by the Ninth Circuit fundamentally on a First Amendment choice
referring back to a famous <i>New York Times v. Sullivan </i>case in 1964,
where Sullivan, who was a police commissioner in Alabama brought a libel action
against four African American clergy and the <i>New York Times</i>. The <i>Times</i>
had published an advertisement back in 1960 in support of civil rights activism
among students, a struggle for the right to vote, a legal defense of Martin
Luther King against a perjury charge, and charges of repressive police
misconduct, including false statements. And the trial judge had instructed the
jury that the advertisement was libelous, that legal injury was implied, that
falsity and malice are presumed, and that punitive damages should be awarded. </p>
<p>So that in this case,
the Supreme Court found that it [the lower court decision] was constitutionally
deficient for failure to safeguard freedom of speech in the press required by
the First and the Fourteenth Amendment. And debate on public issues should be
uninhibited, robust, wide open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic,
and sharp attacks on government and public officials. With respect to actual
malice, because in order to find disparagement or liability in this situation,
there's a need to demonstrate actual malice. The constitutional guarantees
require a federal rule that prohibits a public official from recovering damages
for defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that
the statement was made with actual malice. What's malice? Well, it's with
knowledge that the claim was false when it was made, or with reckless disregard
of whether it was false. And the burden of demonstrating the falsity rests on
the plaintiff. </p>
<p>Now, this seems to
give the media a fairly wide berth in the kinds of claims that they can make.
In the wake of this case, many states passed what are thought of now and
labeled as veggie libel laws. So that rather than placing the burden on a
plaintiff to demonstrate the falsity of the statement, they place the burden on
the individual that makes the claim of significant risk or hazard. So there are
many states that have adopted this statutory change. And what this means is
that it opens the way for slap suits. </p>
<p>What is a slap suit?
It basically is a suit that intimidates people from making claims about the
quality of the environment or causes of its loss or subsequent health damages.
So among these twenty or so states that have adopted these laws, for example,
now I will not give a lecture where I am making a claim of risk. So that might
be thought of as a chilling effect on free speech in a way. So if I'm, say,
being taped on a radio show, that radio show is broadcast in a state where one
of these veggie libel laws exists that would place the burden on me to
demonstrate the proof that my claim is backed up by high quality science, that
will pull me into court, it will cost me thousands of dollars, hundreds of
thousands of dollars even, to defend myself. So that the influence of this form
of law is really quite striking. </p>
<p>What also is
interesting about this evolution of state laws that reverse the burden of proof
is that clearly it's been found by the Supreme Court as being an
unconstitutional shift in the burden. Yet none of these state laws have been
taken up to the Supreme Court for consideration. So think about that. These
laws have been in place now for well over a decade, and all environmental
groups, all public health interest groups understand the nature of these laws
and they're all very self-conscious about the nature of the claims that they
make. </p>
<p>Now, I want to show
you this. Oprah Winfrey hosted a show on mad cow disease. Mad cow disease is an
illness that is caused by a prion and believed to be associated with beef that
are feed other cattle parts in their cattle meal. So Winfrey hosted Howard
Lyman, who described the process of slaughterhouses and beef rendering and how
the parts were ground up and then put into animal feed and fed back in the
United States to cattle that were sold for food. And this was the mechanism
that he and others believed had caused the outbreak of mad cow disease in Great
Britain. Now there are laws that prevent that from happening, but at this point
in time, this represents another rather interesting case on product
disparagement. [pause] Give me one second here. [pause] I've lost
my internet connection, so we're on hold for a moment. [pause] My apology
for that delay.</p>
<p><b>Howard Lyman [on
video]</b>:
With me on the stage, to the left of me a grandmother whose granddaughter is
dying of the human form of mad cow disease in England. To the right of me, a
guy from the National Cattle and Beef Association, points at me and says
&quot;Here is a man who believes within ten years we could have diseases that
make AIDS look like the common cold.&quot; And I said, absolutely. And she
said, &quot;That's such a strong statement.&quot; </p>
<p>I said, &quot;Oprah,
we have 100,000 cows a year alive at night, dead in the morning. We round them
up, grind them up, turn them into feed, feed them back to other cows. We go out
and collect road kill, deer, elk, possum, raccoons, scrape them up off of the
street, grind them up, and feed them back to cows. And then we take pets, city
of Los Angeles, 200 tons of pets, full of chemicals that were used to kill
them, 200 tons a month are ground up, turned into feed, and fed back to our
food animals.&quot; </p>
<p>This time Oprah's
eyes are as big as saucers. I knew that I'd got her. She turns around and looks
at the guy from the National Cattle and Beef Association and says, &quot;Dr.
Weber, are we feeding cows to cows?&quot; I'll never [break in audio]
what he had to say, he said, &quot;Well, you know, there's a limited amount of
that going on.&quot; I believe that about ninety-five percent of the cattle fed
back in factory feed lots are eating the remains of other animals. </p>
<p>And the next thing
out of Oprah's mouth then gets us sued. Oprah says, &quot;That just stops me
cold. I will never again eat a burger.&quot; Now, she didn't say, &quot;I think
the meat's infected.&quot; She didn't say to the millions of viewers, &quot;You
shouldn't eat any.&quot; She just said, &quot;That stops me cold. I will never
again eat a burger.&quot; Now I knew when I went on that show that thirteen
states had a thing called the food disparagement law. The food disparagement
law says that it's against the law to say something you know to be false about
a perishable commodity. I didn't say anything I thought to be false. I told the
truth. </p>
<p>Well, we were taping
the show, took about two hours. When we got done taping the show I walked up to
Oprah and I said to her, I said, &quot;Hey Oprah, give me ten minutes, I'll get
you off of chicken.&quot; Oprah looked at me and said, &quot;Only one animal a
day.&quot; [audience laughter] So, I went about my business.
Couple weeks later, I got a call that said, &quot;Do you realize you're being
sued with Oprah Winfrey and Harpo Production by a group of Texas
cattlemen?&quot; And I said, &quot;No, can I put you on hold?&quot; I raced
into my library, I inventoried my vegetarian cookbooks. I knew those cattlemen
wanted those vegetarian cookbooks bad. I went back and said, &quot;I can't talk
to you right now, I've got to put in a call to Oprah.&quot; I called Oprah and
left a message, and I said, &quot;Oprah, if we lose this suit, I'm going to
throw in my vegetarian cookbooks. You've got to put up the money.&quot; </p>
<p>Well, we end up
getting sued in Amarillo, Texas. I don't know how many of you have ever been to
Amarillo, Texas. It's not the end of the world, but it's clearly visible from
there. If you're going to give the world an enema you take the hose to
Amarillo, Texas. The largest employer in Amarillo, Texas, happens to be the
slaughter facility killing cattle. Bumper stickers all over town said,
&quot;The only mad cow in Texas is named Oprah.&quot; I knew we were in trouble
when I went and saw my lawyer, and I said to him, &quot;We need a change of venue.
There is no way in the world that we can win here in Amarillo.&quot; </p>
<p>So we filed with the
judge for a change of venue. We walked in, who's the judge? Seventy-two-year-old
lady, a tough old heifer. We asked for a change of venue, she picks up the
hammer, slaps it down, and says, &quot;Motion denied. Bring in the jury
pool.&quot; They brought 140 people in. You never saw so many hats, boots, and
belt buckles in all your life. I said to my lawyer, &quot;We need to find an
appeal, because there's no way in the world that we're going to win here.&quot;
At the end of the day, we had twelve jurors, absolutely steeped in the cattle
culture. My lawyer, he looks at me and he said, &quot;They're going to call you
to the stand tomorrow.&quot; He said, &quot;The first question they're going to
ask you is whether or not you are a vegetarian.&quot; I said, &quot;I can
handle that.&quot; He said, &quot;You damn well better, you'll lose.&quot; </p>
<p>Sure enough, the next
day they called me to the stand. I'm on the stand with the plaintiff's attorney
is looking at me, laughing and giggling. And he says, &quot;I can't hardly say
this. Hey, Mr. Lyman, is it true that you are a-- [laughs] --a
vegetarian?&quot; And I looked at the jury and said, &quot;I will not apologize
for something that has saved my life.&quot; Never again in that trial did they
ever ask me about why I was a vegetarian. But they asked me every question you
can imagine. I'm on the stand, the lawyer looks at me and he says, &quot;Mr.
Lyman, has anybody ever called you irresponsible?&quot; I said,
&quot;Yes.&quot; My lawyer's sitting over there going, &quot;No, no, no.&quot;
The plaintiff's attorney thinks he's found the key to the Gordian Knot. And he
looks at me and he says, &quot;Who?&quot; I said, &quot;My wife.&quot; And the
jury's over there, been there, done that. </p>
<p>We were in that
courtroom for six weeks. At the end of six weeks, that jury found Oprah, Harpo
Production and myself not liable. The plaintiffs went out of their tree. They
could not imagine that that jury, that homegrown jury, could find out-of-towners
not liable. And they appealed with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. We spent
a year in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. And at the end of the year, they
came down with a unanimous panel decision that Oprah, Harpo Production and myself
were not liable. And then they wrote an opinion that said, &quot;Everything
that Lyman said on the show was true and the truth is not actionable.&quot; </p>
<p>The cattlemen
couldn&#39;t stand that and asked [inaudible] for a rehearing. It was
denied. And then the cattlemen got together and went to state court and filed
suit against Oprah, Harpo Production and myself with the state court. Thank God
I did not live in Texas. I was able to move it from the state court to the
federal court. They appealed that. We spent six years, hundreds of thousands of
dollars of my money defending [audio break] to tell the truth. At the
end of six years the judge finally threw out the case with prejudice, which
meant the jury, or the plaintiffs could not re-file the case, that the statute
of limitations had run out. So it became six years, hundreds of thousands of
dollars, we were finally vindicated for standing up and telling the truth.</p>
<p><b>Professor John Wargo</b>: So the core of this
problem is the way that these state veggie libel laws shift the burden of
proof. So under federal law, it's really clear that the Cattlemen's Association
was under the burden of proof to demonstrate that the statement was knowingly
false and delivered with malice with the intent to harm. But under state law,
Oprah's burden was to demonstrate that the statement is true with reasonable
certainty. </p>
<p>So I'll leave you
with one thought on this, and the importance of fashioning law in a way that
would protect free speech and open access to knowledge of risk and opinions on
the part of experts. Justice Powell, in 1974 on truth and free speech,
&quot;There's no such thing as a false idea, no matter how pernicious an
opinion may seem, we depend [for] its correction not on the conscience of
judges and juries, but on the competition of other ideas.&quot; </p>
<p>So that's it for
today. Have a great weekend.</p>
