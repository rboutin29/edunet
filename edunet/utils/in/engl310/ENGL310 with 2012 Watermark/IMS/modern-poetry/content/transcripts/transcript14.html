<p><b>Professor Langdon Hammer</b>: <i>The Bridge</i>. In order to get
to <i>The Bridge</i> I want to go back and just say a few more things
about "Voyages" and about Crane in general. In Crane's letter to the
distressed editor of <i>Poetry</i> magazine, Harriet Monroe – that
prose selection included in the back of your book – Crane defends his
poem "At Melville's Tomb" and specifically defends what he calls his
"recourse to the logic of metaphor." What does "the logic of metaphor"
mean for Crane? Well, he distinguishes his criteria from Monroe's, on
page 968. He says:</p>

<blockquote>My poem may well be elliptical and actually obscure.. but
in your criticism… you have stated your objections in terms that allow
me… the privilege of claiming your ideas and ideals as theoretically,
at least, quite outside the issues of my own aspirations. [And he
says:] To put it more plainly, as a poet I may very possibly be more
interested in the so-called illogical impingements of the connotations
of… [well, that's a misprint: it should be "words"] on the
consciousness (and their combinations and interplay in metaphor on this
basis), than I am interested in the preservation of their logically
rigid significations...</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Crane is talking here about putting a kind of priority in his poetry
on connotation over denotation. He's interested in the ways words
relate to and through other words, before or in addition to the ways in
which they relate to the things of the world. In this sense, Crane
introduces us to a sense of poetry as a linguistic environment that is
constructed through words relating among themselves in ways that play
upon our imagination, systems of association that in effect solicit our
contribution to complete the thought, all of which supposes and seeks a
kind of special intimacy with us as readers, and gives us work to
do.</p>

<p>I suggested that the sea is a kind of figure or metaphor in Crane's
work for this linguistic space: an imaginative space to which we are
summoned. In a poem like "At Melville's Tomb," he's concerned with
specifically how messages are transported with, well, what he calls
"the dice of drowned men's bones." You can understand the poem as an
elegy for Melville. It's also about reading Melville and getting his
message; that is, reaching back into the past and becoming, for
Melville, the kind of reader that Crane himself seeks as he describes
it in his letter to Monroe.</p>

<p>In talking about "Voyages II," I suggested that the--or "Voyages
III," rather, the third section of the poem--I suggested that the image
of "infinite consanguinity" was in part an image of this linguistic
mixing and promiscuity that Crane is interested in in poetry. In this
poem, the mixing of words in poetry is analogized to the mixing of
bodies of lovers. Love here is also like death because it's a
shattering experience through which the self is remade and changed with
and through another. This is a process of transformation. It's one that
Crane calls "transmemberment," which is a way of evoking not so much a
sharing of identity, but rather some kind of exchange of it, which is
an experience of the self changed and the self redeemed. In Crane's
eyes this is exactly what <i>The Waste Land</i> contemplates and draws
back from; doesn't embrace, turns away from. It's what, in Crane, love
promises. It's what poetry, song promises. The space of the poem, which
is like, as Crane imagines it, a space of love, is set apart from
ordinary life. You might contrast the kind of song and singing that you
find in this poem with Eliot's love song for Prufrock.</p>

<p>Crane recovers in this poem a kind of heroic blank verse, the medium
of heroic drama, and uses it for the speech of a poet-lover who
celebrates the power of sound to make its own sense, through the
affirming force of desire. He imagines this, again, as a kind of
resurrection of some kind, what he talks about as what has to happen
after <i>The Waste Land</i>. In this sense, Crane is talking about some
kind of passage through death, and you can understand that death as
Crane's admission, as I suggested last time, of the illusory nature of
rhetoric, of love itself, of the power of desire, which Crane is always
realistic about, you could say. The poem, "Voyages," treats--its theme
is really the triumph of desire, even in defeat. That's also the theme
of "At Melville's Tomb," and it's the grand theme of <i>The
Bridge.</i></p>

<p><i>The Bridge</i> is Crane's great poem about America. Let me bring
up a picture of him. This is Crane in 1927 or '28. It's unclear exactly
when the photo was taken by Walker Evans, a great American photographer
and Crane's friend, on top of 110 Columbia Heights where Crane lived,
in view of Manhattan and the bridge, the Brooklyn Bridge. <i>The
Bridge</i> is Crane's great poem about America or about the idea of
America, and I'll say more about what that means in a moment. And it's
a reply, self-consciously so, to <i>The Waste Land</i>. I suggested
that the shortness of <i>The Waste Land</i> was in some ways a kind of
argument against epic in the modern world, an argument about the
impossibility of epic vision in a culture which lacks shared myths,
shared symbols. Against this lack Crane proposes the bridge, the
Brooklyn Bridge, as a kind of central organizing symbol for modern
culture.</p>

<p>This is a picture of the bridge being built in the nineteenth
century. It's important that as Crane looks at the bridge as a modern
symbol, that we remember that it wasn't built in 1920. I've forgotten
now the year in which it is, but it was at least, I think, sixty years
old at this point. And you can see when Roebling's bridge was first
created, there's no Manhattan skyline for it to reach to. When Crane
turns to the bridge as a symbol of the modern, he's already looking
back to an earlier vision of the modern, if you like. And in doing so
he is joining many other American artists.</p>

<p>This is a photograph by Walker Evans, who took many images of the
bridge with its cables and Gothic arches, all of which play into
Crane's poems in complex ways. This is the very great poem, one of
many--or [I mean] painting by Joseph Stella that appears in the Yale
[Art] Gallery: a fantastic work, one that Crane hadn't seen actually
when he began <i>The Bridge</i>, but which in all sorts of ways is
harmonious with his vision, including the ways in which the sublime
vision that it offers includes darkness and, I would have to say,
perhaps frightening or sinister elements. It is also importantly a
moment in American art when artists like Stella, like Crane, are
interested--here's John Marin with another image, this one painted from
the bridge--in which artists are creating a kind of idiom that involves
and includes abstraction, shows us images of the world in realist
representation that are being transformed into something semi-abstract
and symbolic. Crane is very much involved in the same kind of activity
as these artists. These are more images from Evans; these, of course,
shot from underneath the bridge and showing it as a kind of abstract
form rising into the New York skyline.</p>

<p>This is the title page of Crane's poem as it appeared in the Black
Sun edition, a limited edition in Paris in 1930, its first publication
followed shortly thereafter by a publication in New York. Crane took
the Brooklyn Bridge as a kind of symbol of a structure, the structure
of a spiritual action, as he understood it, underpinning American
history. It seemed to him to embody an idea that he saw variously
embodied in American history. For Crane, American history is a series
of new world visions, all of them versions or avatars of what he also
calls Atlantis, the city sunk beneath the waves in Platonic myth that
promises to return and return us to some kind of redeemed community.
Atlantis is Crane's name for a kind of promised relation to the world
that's been glimpsed but also lost. To aim at Atlantis, as the poem
does, and as Crane says American history does, is to go interestingly,
confusingly, simultaneously into the past and into the future; to
rescue or recover something from history, promised for the future; and
to bring that future into being. Crane understands the mythic work of
the poem, his poem, as a kind of active crossing, one that has this
chronological mission of going back into the past and forward into the
future.</p>

<p>The title page here – you can't make it out, but it's clear in your
anthology – carries an epigraph from The Book of Job: "From going to
and fro in the earth, / and from walking up and down in it." The
epigraph from Job introduces these two motions as being essential to
Crane's imagination in the poem; that is, going to and fro, back and
forth, and by going up and down. You can see these two motions, in
fact, easily visualizable in the form of the bridge itself, which
drives its pylons into the river and rises up in these Gothic
structures in order to carry people back and forth across the river.
The epigraph is also a kind of joke because Crane wrote this poem, like
Job, tramping around across the Northeast from one apartment or house
to another, or one couch to another; and wrote it in Europe and
California and elsewhere, himself, Crane, being without a secure
station in the poem, in the writing of the poem. Crane's interest in
the poem in hobos and marginals of many kinds, as well as with pioneers
and other kinds of travelers, all represent figures of spiritual
questers who are in a sense without a station in life but rather in
motion, as Crane himself was.</p>

<p>This is the table of contents of the poem. It's helpful, I think, to
look at it because it's confusing. The poem consists in this proem,
which I'll talk about in a few moments, where Crane actually dedicates
his long poem, actually dedicates this poem to the Brooklyn Bridge – as
if you could dedicate a poem to the bridge, to an object; a first
section, called "Ave Maria," which is spoken by Columbus – Columbus,
not on his way to the New World but rather on his way back. He speaks
to us on his way back, and it introduces the theme of carrying the
message or the vision forward into the future. The question of how to
retrieve or recover the vision of the New World is initially introduced
there.</p>

<p>Then there's a section called "Powhatan's Daughter," which refers to
Pocahontas, invokes a vision of the American continent through a series
of poems: "The Harbor Dance," "Van Winkle," "The River," "The Dance,"
and "Indiana," which all explore various moments in the history of the
conquering of the continent. There's a section called "Cutty Sark"
which introduces us to a drunken visionary sailor in a bar on Sand
Street in Lower Manhattan. That figure seems to metamorphose into Walt
Whitman in Section IV, "Cape Hatteras," in a sense the center of the
poem. "Cape Hatteras" is concerned with the invention of flight, and it
links Whitman to, really, the whole history of American invention.
There is a series of songs called "Three Songs"; another section called
"Quaker Hill," evoking a 1920s New York suburb, really, or Connecticut
Hills, which brings us up to the present; as does the poem, "The
Tunnel"--the tunnel being that most closely based on <i>The Waste
Land</i> and describing a kind of infernal journey through the New York
subways; and then finally "Atlantis," a kind of visionary rhapsody that
invokes the object of quest that the poem is concerned with.</p>

<p>The poem in this way charts various journeys westward and eastward,
back and forth in time. Discovery means nothing without the relaying of
the vision, the carrying it forward. <i>The Bridge</i> is concerned
with, in these various sections, with a series of symbols, symbols that
are very frequently vehicles or transports, from Columbus's ship to the
subway, to the Wright Brothers' airplanes. Transport: this is, in a
sense, the grand theme of <i>The Bridge</i>. The root meaning of
metaphor is "to carry something over," to transport it. For Crane,
metaphor is as central a concept and activity as translation is for
Pound. But in Crane the emphasis is on imaginative transformation.
That's really what metaphor has to offer. The central symbol of <i>The
Bridge</i>, the bridge itself, you could understand as a metaphor for
metaphor; a metaphor for a primary human capacity, the capacity to
posit an object of desire – "Frosted eyes there were that lifted
altars" – to posit an object of desire that expands the horizon of the
real, what's possible, and in so doing violates existing systems of
cognition and projects the vision of a new world. This also means that
the poem is constantly producing new symbols for this activity, new
metaphors. Crane said in one letter, "The bridge in becoming a ship, a
world, a woman, a tremendous harp, as it finally does, seems really to
have a career." And so it does.</p>

<p>This is, again, the Black Sun edition, which I recommend that you go
to the Beinecke and look at. It's one of the most beautiful books I
know. It's a great big book with these big margins and red headings.
Let's look at the proem as both an introduction to the poem and as a
kind of summary, in miniature, of its intentions, claims,
procedures:</p>

<blockquote><i>How many dawns, chill from his rippling rest<br />
</i><i>The seagull's wings shall dip and pivot him,<br />
</i><i>Shedding white rings of tumult, building high<br />
</i><i>Over the chained bay waters Liberty --</i><br />
<br />
<i>Then, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes<br />
</i> <i>As apparitional as sails that cross<br />
</i> <i>Some page of figures to be filed away;<br />
</i> <i>--Till elevators drop us from our day…</i></blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>The poem begins with another resurrection of some kind; in this
case, not a seal rising from the water to gaze toward paradise, but
rather a seagull rising as many times before, "<i>How many dawns, chill
from his rippling rest</i>." And this seagull becomes a kind of image
of ascent and flight. I guess it is an initial image of transport. The
bird sheds "<i>white rings of tumult</i>" and there's that word from
"Voyages III," remember? "And where death, if shed, / presumes no
carnage, but this single change..." Here, again, there's an action of
shedding as the bird throws off the darkness of the night and rises,
"<i>building high</i>," then disappears. The vision vanishes. We are in
the world of work, we are in the office spaces of Lower
Manhattan,"<i>--Till elevators drop us from our day…</i>" And if we've
just gone up now, we go down again:</p>

<blockquote><i>I think of cinemas, panoramic sleights<br />
</i> <i>With multitudes bent toward some flashing scene<br />
</i> <i>Never disclosed, but hastened to again,<br />
</i> <i>Foretold to other eyes on the same screen….</i></blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>The movie theater: the movie theater is a new machine of transport
in the twenties, a kind of mass entertainment that Crane's poem will,
in a sense, try to rival and provide a complementary way of imagining a
collective vision. And what he offers next is the bridge, which he
addresses in this archaic language – archaic and intimate language – as
if Brooklyn Bridge could have a subjectivity:</p>

<blockquote><i>And Thee</i> [he says]<i>,</i> a<i>cross the harbor,
silver-paced</i> [as if the light on the<br />
 bridge were being seen as a kind of movement that the bridge was
itself<br />
 involved in]<br />
 <i>As though the sun took step of thee, yet left<br />
</i> <i>Some motion ever unspent in thy stride,--<br />
</i> <i>Implicitly thy freedom staying thee!</i></blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>This is a wild kind of address to architecture, as if the bridge
were animate with the power of motion and as if it had a kind of motion
that was fountain-like and could not be exhausted. Then suddenly, we're
given another vision. The threat of suicide suddenly rises up in the
poem:</p>

<blockquote><i>Out of some subway scuttle, cell or loft<br />
</i> <i>A bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,<br />
</i> <i>Tilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,<br />
</i> <i>A jest falls from the speechless caravan.</i></blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>The possibility of failure seems dialectically to be written into
this poem's grand ambition, its wish for ascent and redemption. Crane
turns them to images of the bridge in the New York skyline:</p>

<blockquote><i>Down Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,<br />
</i> <i>A rip-tooth of the sky's acetylene;<br />
</i> <i>All afternoon the cloud-flown derricks turn…<br />
</i> <i>Thy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.</i></blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>As if it were a kind of ship. I don't know about you, but I am
thrilled every time I read Crane's language for evoking the kind of
sensual power of New York architecture.</p>

<blockquote><i>O harp and altar, of the fury fused,<br />
</i> <i>(How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)</i> [the
bridge is harp and<br />
 altar--instrument of music and site of worship]<br />
 <i>Terrific threshold of the prophet's pledge,<br />
</i> <i>Prayer of pariah, and the lover's cry,--</i><br />
<br />
 <i>Again the traffic lights that skim thy swift<br />
</i> <i>Unfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,<br />
</i> <i>Beading thy path--condense eternity:<br />
</i> <i>And we have seen night lifted in thine arms.</i><br />
<br />
 <i>Under thy shadow by the piers I waited;<br />
</i> <i>Only in darkness is thy shadow clear.<br />
</i> <i>The City's fiery parcels all undone,<br />
</i> <i>Already snow submerges an iron year…</i><br />
<br />
 <i>O Sleepless as the river under thee,<br />
</i> <i>Vaulting the sea, the prairies' dreaming sod</i> [suddenly the
bridge crosses<br />
 the Atlantic, it crosses the American continent],<br />
 <i>Unto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend</i> [and now it's a kind
of divinity<br />
 that he beseeches to descend]<br />
 <i>And of the curveship</i> [the bridge itself seen as a kind of
vehicle of a<br />
 curveship] <i>lend a myth to God.</i></blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>The poem means to incorporate the threat of failure and the threat
of death and move beyond it, much as it aims to incorporate <i>The
Waste Land</i>'s despair and move beyond it. It is a kind of jest, a
kind of prayer, a kind of pledge that belongs to lover or pariah; these
are speech acts that are models for the kind of poem that you're
reading. The intention is to somehow create from a series of fragments
a whole that would be an "unfractioned idiom," as Crane calls it, which
would be a kind of pure and redeemed language. There's that phrase in
the last stanza, "of the curveship," meaning both derived from the
bridge, I think, and partaking of it. He asks the bridge to lend a myth
to God. "To lend" is to give knowing it will be given back. This is not
a permanent name for God, it is not the one symbol for God. It is only
one in an ongoing series of acts of naming, which are all acts of
metaphor, which are all acts by which something from the past is joined
to the future – something far is joined with something near – out of
some kind of spiritual need or vision.</p>

<p>Well, the poem was begun – Crane liked this idea – with both ends at
once just the way you build a bridge: by writing the proem and by
writing "Atlantis," and gradually over time moving towards the middle.
This is the final section, "Atlantis." In fact, why don't we turn there
for a moment. This is a splendid, outrageous, Shelleyan lyric
speech:</p>

<blockquote>Through the bound cable strands, the arching path<br />
 Upward, veering with light, the flight of strings [and you can image
now in<br />
 your minds that great Stella painting over in the gallery],--<br />
 Taut miles of shuttling moonlight syncopate<br />
 The whispered rush, telepathy of wires.<br />
 Up the index of night, granite and steel--<br />
 Transparent meshes--fleckless the gleaming staves--<br />
 Sibylline voices flicker, waveringly stream<br />
 As though a god were issue of the strings….</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Here at the end of the poem, Crane imagines a kind of ascent through
the structure of the bridge which becomes a grand musical instrument, a
harp. The visionary appears here in fragmentary ways, as in line 25,
where: "Sheerly the eyes, like seagulls stung with rime--/ slit and
propelled by glistening fins of light…" Crane talks here about the eyes
moving up through this structure like the seagull that we saw in the
first line of the poem. The object of desire, the version of paradise
Crane offers us is there in line 42 or so where he talks about the
bridge as "Vision-of-the-Voyage":</p>

<blockquote>Bridge, lifting night to cycloramic [it should be]
crest<br />
 Of deepest day--O Choir, translating time<br />
 Into what multitudinous Verb the suns<br />
 And synergy of waters ever fuse [as if somehow the sun and water
on<br />
 the space of the bridge beneath it created what Crane calls a<br />
 "multitudinous Verb"], recast<br />
 In myriad syllables,--Psalm of Cathay! [That's of course
Columbus's<br />
 goal, Cathay.]<br />
 O Love, thy white, pervasive Paradigm…! [It's also a vision of
love.]</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Here Crane gives us a kind of vision of the word, the "multitudinous
Verb," as what his poem draws its energy from and what it moves
towards. It is not a Christian Word, importantly. It is, I think, a
name for a creative process that's accessed in and through our powers
of language. "The word" in Crane's poem is secular and historical but
yet it unfolds from what he calls an "Everpresence," beyond time,
towards which the poem is questing. It is a creativity, a kind of power
of world-making that's embodied in our language.</p>

<p>Crane is imagining a post-Christian religion for which America
provides iconography and myths. The poem is an encyclopedia of American
places and American culture – popular culture and burlesque in
"National Winter Garden," in "The River," in "Virginia." There's slang,
jazz, advertising, all of that, worked into the poem. The poem combines
a kind of popular storybook history of figures like Rip Van Winkle and
the most challenging, abstract modernist poetics at the same time.
Every line is loaded with symbols and referents linking up to other
lines in the same way. In the same way, Crane is suggesting that every
moment in American history links up with others and with a larger
structure of action, of which it is part. Crane's poem is therefore, I
think, at once knowingly naïve and hyper-sophisticated, both of these
things at once.</p>

<p>Crane composed the poem through the funding, with the funding of
Otto Kahn, a businessman and philanthropist, and he explains his
outline of the poem at still a relatively early period of composition
in that letter to Otto Kahn that I included for you last time. Well,
I'll refer to it briefly. Keeping in mind that table of contents I
showed you before, there's a kind of story of American history told in
large in the poem in which Crane moves from Columbus to the section
called "Powhatan's Daughter," where the theme is the betrayal of the
land in the conquest of the continent. In the middle, in "Cape
Hatteras," when Crane is writing about invention and technology in
American culture, his theme is also the Civil War and World War One;
again, a kind of betrayal of vision by which technology becomes a means
to kill.</p>

<p>In his letter to Kahn, he talks about having a section on John Brown
that would take up the topic of slavery. This section was never written
but there are traces of it you find in the section called "The River."
In each of these sections, Crane turns to and looks to, again, hobos,
marginal figures who are emblems of lost promise, who seem to represent
possibilities included in but also marginalized by American history,
American culture. You can understand these figures, such as the sailor
that you meet in "Cutty Sark," as versions of the authors to whom Crane
appeals throughout, through allusion and epigraph: Melville, Dickinson,
Poe in "The Tunnel." Crane reaches back to these authors, canonical for
us, authors that you study but that were largely left out of accounts
of American literary history in the 1920s, who themselves appeared to
be marginals. These are versions of a kind of community that Crane
wants to recover and carry forward for the creative promise that they
seem to embody.</p>

<p>Well, let me just point to the poem's, let's say, two different
endings. The history of the composition of the poem is different from
the sequence that you read. Because Crane began at both ends, the end
of the poem is really, in one sense, the middle. When Crane completes
"Cape Hatteras," at last, after struggling with this section for a
couple of years, he completes the span of the bridge in one particular
image, and that's towards the end of the section on [page] 636. And he
evokes and quotes Whitman; Whitman, again, here seen as a kind of
marginal who is recovered for American culture through the poem's
imaginative act. Whitman is addressed:</p>

<blockquote>Recorders ages hence [that's a quote from Whitman's
"Calamus"<br />
 poems], yes, they shall hear<br />
 In their own veins uncancelled thy sure tread [Whitman]<br />
 And read thee by the aureole [the halo] 'round thy head<br />
 Of pasture-shine, <i>Panis Angelicus</i>! [Bread of angels. Here
Whitman<br />
 becomes a kind of figure for a secular communion.]<br />
 yes, Walt,<br />
 Afoot again, and onward without halt--<br />
 Not soon, nor suddenly,--no, never to let go<br />
 My hand<br />
 in yours,<br />
 Walt Whitman--<br />
 so--</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>That's a moment when in this hand clasp a certain aspiration of the
poem is completed and a connection to the past is achieved and
asserted. The conclusion of the poem that we find at the end of
"Atlantis" is another vision, and I'll conclude with that. It's, I
think, something to be contrasted with this triumphant and reassuring
conclusion that "Cape Hatteras" offers. Here are the last two sublime
stanzas of the poem.</p>

<blockquote>Migrations that must needs void memory,<br />
 Inventions that cobblestone the heart,--<br />
 Unspeakable Thou Bridge to Thee, O Love.<br />
 Thy pardon for this history, whitest Flower,<br />
 O Answerer of all,--Anemone,--<br />
 Now while thy petals spend the suns about us, hold--<br />
 (O Thou whose radiance doth inherit me)<br />
 Atlantis,--hold thy floating singer late!</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Here, Atlantis is brought into being with the singer himself on the
verge of drowning, "thy floating singer." And then finally Crane
dedicates himself to this vision which he calls "Everpresence":</p>

<blockquote>So to thine Everpresence, beyond time,<br />
 Like spears ensanguined of one tolling star<br />
 That bleeds infinity--the orphic strings [now the cables of the
bridge<br />
 have become the strings of Orpheus's lyre],<br />
 Sidereal phalanxes, leap and converge [and again you can see the<br />
 structure of the bridge imaged there]:<br />
 -- One Song, one Bridge of Fire! Is it Cathay,<br />
 Now pity steeps the grass and rainbows ring<br />
 The serpent with the eagles in the leaves…?<br />
 Whispers antiphonal in azure swing.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>The poem ends with this question, "Is it Cathay?" Columbus's
question: an error, a mistake. It is the nature of the object of desire
to be misnamed, precisely because it has no one name. And even in this
error, this kind of defeat, there is for Crane an affirming of the
scope of desire, precisely through its failure to be contained by a
single reference.</p>

<p>Well, we'll stop now. And I know you have done your work and
gathered a note. We'll collect these and put together our own annotated
version of the poem.</p>
