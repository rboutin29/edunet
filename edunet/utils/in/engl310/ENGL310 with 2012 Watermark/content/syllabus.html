<h2>ENGL 310: <strong>Modern Poetry </strong>(Spring, 2007)</h2>

<h3>Syllabus</h3>

<h4>Professor:</h4>

<p class="lastParagraph">Langdon Hammer, Professor of English, Chair, Department of English, Yale University</p>
<h4>Description:</h4>

<p class="lastParagraph">This course covers the body of modern poetry, its characteristic techniques, concerns, and major practitioners. The authors discussed range from Yeats, Eliot, and Pound to Stevens, Moore, Bishop, and Frost with additional lectures on the poetry of World War One, Imagism, and the Harlem Renaissance. Diverse methods of literary criticism are employed, such as historical, biographical, and gender criticism. Broad thematic concerns are also presented, including the existence or non-existence of God, the representation of a multi-vocalic society, the use and depiction of history, and Modernism's complicated relationship with its literary predecessors. Literary Modernism is frequently treated alongside other forms of Modernism, especially painting, sculpture, photography, and architecture, in order to convey a wider sense of the movement and the variations within it.</p>
