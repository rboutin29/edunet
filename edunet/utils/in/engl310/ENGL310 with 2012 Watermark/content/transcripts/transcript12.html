<p><b>Professor Langdon Hammer</b>: Is private ritual possible? This is
a kind of oxymoron, "a private ritual," because ritual is, or should
be, precisely something that's collective and shared. Is it possible
for the individual to produce some kind of shared patterning of
experience such as ritual represents? For Freud, who is, of course, a
thinker in the background of <i>The Waste Land</i> and all of the
poetry that we're reading and thinking about this semester, private
ritual meant neurosis, sickness of a kind, some kind of derangement.
And indeed, <i>The Waste Land</i>, which is a poem that in certain ways
tries to imagine a form of private ritual, or at least struggles with
this question, was certainly considered by some readers to be a
neurotic poem.</p>

<p>I began last time by talking about that first verse paragraph of the
poem. Why don't we go back there. That's on [page] 474 in our
anthology. I'll try to talk about the poem in sequence from first
section to last and at least tell you some of the ways in which I make
sense of it. And this may be, I hope, helpful to you. In this first
section, "The Burial of the Dead," we have, well, what I think of as a
series of preliminary statements about the poem's aims: what it seeks,
what it would gesture towards or move towards. They include, well, some
form of ecstasy. I think Marie's sled ride is an experience of personal
freedom in its modest way. "In the mountains, there you feel free," she
says, recalling that experience. Prophecy. The poem introduces us to
prophecy in the second verse paragraph. Freedom, I suppose. Intimacy
between people, some kind of meaningful coherence. All of these
possibilities of experience are, as it were, glimpsed in the poem in
this beginning, glimpsed and then withdrawn or blocked or parodied.
Marie's sled: well, isn't that a kind of figure for letting go and,
well, for release and for trust? An experience, as I say, of freedom.
Ultimately, in "What the Thunder Said," the poem will again return to
those specific themes when it interprets those Sanskrit words
<i>Datta</i>, <i>Dayadhvam</i>, and so on.</p>

<p>Well, in the second paragraph of the poem – a sort of second
strophe, if you like – we're introduced to this sort of wasteland
landscape. It's a kind of landscape that the poem returns to at
different points.</p>

<blockquote>What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow<br />
 Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,<br />
 You cannot say, or guess, for you know only<br />
 A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,<br />
 And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,<br />
 And the dry stone no sound of water.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Here, well, we have a kind of symbolic representation, a kind of
modernist iconography, if you like, of a spiritual state, one of
desiccation. It is, as it were, a kind of picture of the mental space
inhabited by the people that we'll meet in this poem. Well, there are
quotations here, your notes from Eliot and then your editor explain,
from Ezekiel. The poem is drawing on prophetic language and giving its
own form of prophecy. But Ezekiel here is secularized in this context.
And you might look at this as something more like a quotation from
prophecy rather than prophecy itself. Here, the poem's general concern
with a spiritual state that – let me call it the withdrawal of God – is
represented, as I say, as dryness, as dryness and as fragmentation.
What we have is "stony rubbish. . . / a heap of broken images, where
the sun beats." Here, you know, we've got a kind of fragment of sacred
text, itself, you know, if you like, a bit of rubbish that's part of
the poem's heap of broken images that we will explore. The withdrawal
of God in the poem is a kind of fall into fragmentation where
experience doesn't cohere, where there's dryness; there's no
connectivity, there's not fluidity.</p>

<p>The poem then moves abruptly. And the poem, you know, it moves at
this kind of exhilarating abruptness throughout between kinds of
language; here, introducing Wagner and a little quotation from a
quatrain from the libretto for <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>, translated
for us:</p>

<blockquote>Fresh blows the wind<br />
 To the homeland;<br />
 My Irish darling,<br />
 Where are you waiting?</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Isolde hears this song, and it's a kind of, well, song of longing as
she goes off to marry the wrong man. This Wagner text and the little
quotation from it down below – again, another quotation from Wagner,
"Oed' und leer das Meer" – is a more sinister and haunting phrase that
may be translated as, "waste and empty the sea" or "desolate and empty
the sea" here. This frames a little vignette, a little scene, a
dialogue or part of a dialogue: "'You gave me hyacinths first a year
ago; / They called me the hyacinth girl.'" And then out of that
quotation, the poem now speaks to us, as it were, more directly without
quotation marks.</p>

<blockquote>-- Yet when we came back, late from the hyacinth
garden,<br />
 Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not<br />
 Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither<br />
 Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,<br />
 Looking into the heart of light, the silence.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>A kind of ecstatic vision, but here one of a certain, perhaps
frightening emptiness where a couple, presumably, have had some kind of
exchange that leaves the speaker with this particular vision of the
heart of light and silence. The references to the flower, the hyacinth,
call up the whole system of images of April and spring that the poem
will play on, as well as the story of Hyacinth from <i>The
Metamorphoses</i>. And your editor here will explain that "Apollo loved
and accidentally killed Hyacinth; from his blood sprang the flower
named for him, inscribed with ‘AI,' a cry of grief." Here, love is
associated with killing and also with a kind of generation, though of a
painful and disturbing kind. Here the general, you know, wasteland
space, with what I'm calling the space of God's absence, becomes a
space between two people, two lovers and, it seems, some form of missed
connection. As a sequence, these lines I've just been talking about,
like the poem as a whole, advance by collage. They make a kind of
argument. They make a kind of sense, but perhaps not in the ways that
we're used to.</p>

<p>These materials together, I think, suggest that the loss of common
experience that comes with the withdrawal of God is played out between
people in their erotic relationships. Where God was, sex is. Or you
could say that the loss of collective and sharable meanings, which
results in the privacy of our mental experience – our dreams, our
aspirations, memories, poems, difficult poems – is represented here in
this poem by the irreducibly private, and therefore anguishing, nature
of sexuality. And this is a theme that the poem will return to again
and again. Instead of reciprocity and some kind of mutuality in human
relations, we find people doing kinds of violence to each other,
dominating each other; finding incompleteness in their unions.</p>

<p>The poem then moves on, again, with a kind of exhilarating shift of
register or reference, to a comic figure, "Madame Sosostris, famous
clarvoyante" with a bad cold. I think of Madame Sosostris often in the
winter. She is nevertheless "known to be the wisest woman in Europe,"
and she had "a wicked pack of cards." What does she produce? Well:</p>

<p>Here, said she,</p>

<blockquote>Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor. [Who is "you"?
Perhaps<br />
 ourselves, the reader; perhaps the poet.]<br />
 (Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)<br />
 Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,<br />
 The lady of situations.<br />
 Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel…</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>And so on. And something that she is forbidden to see:</p>

<blockquote>I do not find<br />
 The Hanged Man. Fear death by water.<br />
 I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.<br />
 Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,<br />
 Tell her I bring the horoscope myself:<br />
 One must be so careful these days.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>This is a wonderful passage. Here, it's doing a number of different
things. The horoscope seems like a kind of debased modern form of--a
modern system of interpretation, a way of understanding the self. There
is, in these lines, a kind of parody of occultism, which would include,
perhaps, a parody of Yeats, although Yeats's <i>Vision</i> wasn't
published yet. At the same time, even while the poem is parodic, it's
serious, too, because in this kind of <i>ad hoc</i>, somewhat fanciful
and crazy way, Madame Sosostris's cards are producing images that Eliot
is dealing us and that he will collect in the course of the poem and
try to make some sense of in the collage that is <i>The Waste Land</i>,
including among those cards the drowned Phoenician sailor who will
return for us in that little section "Death by Water." Well, I like to
think of Eliot himself as Mrs. Equitone. That is because he's so
difficult to read in his tone, and after all, it's, in a sense, Mrs.
Equitone who is getting this stuff and is going to try to do something
with it.</p>

<p>Well, Part I, "The Burial of the Dead," ends with another instance
of scene-setting. Now, this sort of symbolic iconography of the dry
landscape is going to be overlaid on another landscape, which is
metropolitan London. "Unreal City": this is Eliot's evocative name for
the urban space that the poem represents.</p>

<blockquote>Unreal city,<br />
 Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,<br />
 A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,<br />
 I had not thought death had undone so many.<br />
 Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,<br />
 And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.<br />
 Flowed up the hill and down [in a rhyming couplet] King William
Street,<br />
 To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours<br />
 With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>You go to the note, and Eliot says, "A phenomenon which I have often
noticed," just in case you were wondering whether he's in the scene or
not. Well, here we are being introduced to the metropolis, which, as I
say, is the scene of <i>The Waste Land</i>. It's where the events of
the poem will take place, more or less. What we're seeing here are
people going to work, people that we're going to see later, in effect,
in the poem: the typist and "the young man carbuncular" must be
crossing, too, or the people that we'll meet in the pub and so on.
There's a kind of strange mixing here of the dead and the living, of
the apocalyptic and the utterly ordinary.</p>

<p>Eliot then moves with, you know, again, no framing that would help
us:</p>

<blockquote>There I saw one I knew [and then who of course is this "I"
who is<br />
 speaking to us? We don't really know], and stopped him, crying:<br />
 "Stetson!<br />
 "You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!<br />
 "That corpse you planted last year in your garden,<br />
 "Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year? [A hyacinth
perhaps?]<br />
 "Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?<br />
 "O keep the Dog far hence, that's friend to men,<br />
 "Or with his nails he'll dig it up again!<br />
 "You! hypocrite lecteur!--mon semblable,--mon frère!"</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>He says, quoting Baudelaire, at the very end bursting out with it.
It's a, again, fascinating turn that the poem takes. There is, perhaps,
a kind of glimpse of the still echoing World War in the here imagined
hailing of one man who knew another in battle. That is, the ships at
Mylae where they last met. There's here another instance of exchange
between two people. Here, there's a way in which that first person's
address to Stetson plays upon or parodies, if you like, the poet's
relation to you or to me the reader. There's here a general problem or
question of how to make each other out, how to recognize and
acknowledge the relation between brothers or "semblables," as
Baudelaire would have us call them.</p>

<p>The little glimpse of war and the war dead, perhaps, that we get in
these lines will throughout the rest of the poem turn into a post-war
vision of, again, war between the sexes and war between people, most
immediately in "A Game of Chess." In this second section, which is
built around two conversations, the first takes place in a well-to-do
drawing room, the second in a pub. There's much to contemplate in the
opening description of that home, where we'll hear these two characters
speaking and thinking in a moment. One that is important and recurs
often in the scene--one detail that recurs often in the poem, is the
image of Philomel around line 98. "As though a window" --oh, excuse me.
Let me go a little bit further:</p>

<blockquote>Above the antique mantel was displayed<br />
 As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene<br />
 The change of Philomel [another Ovidian metamorphosis], by the<br />
 barbarous king<br />
 So rudely forced [Philomel raped by Tereus is transformed into
the<br />
 nightingale]; yet there the nightingale<br />
 Filled all the desert with inviolable voice…</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Suddenly, Eliot has brought us into this dining room to see this
picture, and now we're in the picture listening to the nightingale
filling all the desert, this wasteland space, with a kind of, again,
song of complaint, a kind of lyric voice that's called here
"inviolable."</p>

<blockquote>…And still she cried, and still the world pursues,<br />
 "Jug Jug" to dirty ears.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>"Jug Jug" being the conventional representation of the nightingale's
song in Elizabethan poetry. Well, this is, you know, again, an image of
sexual violence that produces a particular kind of lyric utterance. It
is a kind of motif that recurs in the poem, and it's also a way of
imaging the poem itself as a kind of "inviolable voice" that emerges
from some kind of vision of erotic violation.</p>

<p>In the conversation that follows, if it's a conversation, what we
have is one speaker speaking in quotation marks and the other speaking
without quotation marks. What does that mean? Presumably, the one
speaker that we overhear that seems to be female, we're hearing her
speak. When those quotation marks disappear, probably for the man's
speech, that would seem to represent some kind of interiorized speech,
some kind of thought:</p>

<blockquote>"My nerves are bad to-night. Yes, bad. Stay with me.<br />
 "Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak.<br />
 "What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?<br />
 "I never know what you are thinking. Think."<br />
<br />
I think we are in rats' alley<br />
 Where the dead men lost their bones.<br />
 "What is that noise?"<br />
The wind under the door.<br />
<br />
"What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?"<br />
Nothing again nothing. [Another phrase that will recur in the
poem.]<br />
 "Do<br />
 "You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember<br />
 "Nothing?"<br />
<br />
I remember<br />
 Those are pearls that were his eyes.<br />
 "Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?"<br />
But<br />
<br />
O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag --<br />
 It's so elegant<br />
 So intelligent<br />
 "What shall I do now? What shall I do?" <b>[</b>Quotations there from
<i>Prufrock</i>,<br />
 right?]<br />
 "I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street<br />
 "With my hair down, so. [Here Prufrock<i>'s</i> questions are being
answered<br />
 perhaps.] What shall we do tomorrow?<br />
 "What shall we ever do?"<br />
 The hot water at ten.<br />
 And if it rains, a closed car at four.<br />
 And we shall play a game of chess,<br />
 Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the
door.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>This is often understood as a version of an evening at the Eliots.
The female speaker is being satirized, surely. She's frightening, but
surely also is her companion. They're driving each other mad. It's a
kind of <i>folie a deux</i>. The first person here speaks for a kind of
state that other people experience in the poem and that other
first-persons in this poem experience: that is the condition of having
nothing in your head; "nothing" almost constituting "something"; again,
"nothing" being a kind of wasteland.</p>

<p>But in that wasteland, nevertheless, there persist certain kinds of
rubbish, fragments, bits of language, as in Prufrock'<i>s</i>
consciousness. And this speaker recalls, first of all, when pressed,
"Those are pearls that were his eyes": a quotation from <i>The
Tempest</i>, a quotation from Ariel's song that holds out some image of
death by water that would provide some kind of transformation where
eyes might become pearls. By calling up Shakespeare and <i>The
Tempest</i>, Eliot evokes Shakespeare's whole romance promise of
transformation through drowning, through magic, and romance redemption.
In the course of the poem, that little fragment will become another
motif that recurs and circulates, becoming almost a kind of object of
collective memory in the poem, a bit of shared knowledge of, let's say,
potential that is drawn specifically from the literary past. You could
say that here and elsewhere Shakespeare and literary tradition in
general stand in for sacred texts that would offer some kind of guide
to action and some source of meaning.</p>

<p>Here, the sacred text of Shakespeare is no sooner invoked than it is
parodied through this 1912 jazz song that comes to mind, as also in,
presumably, the speaker's head: the "Shakespeherian Rag--/ It's so
elegant / so intelligent." There's a way in which, well, Eliot's making
fun of his own wish for Shakespeare to be meaningful. There's also a
way in which the jazz brings this speaker suddenly to some kind of
manic life, and he has a kind of energy fitfully for a moment. And
here, as in other moments in the poem, high culture and low culture are
brought together in a kind of vertiginous and interesting way. In fact,
you could see this whole section, "A Game of Chess," as doing that
since we move from the drawing room and its particular interior
decoration to the pub scene that follows with the account of Lil's
childbearing and so forth that we then get to overhear. And then the
poem, or rather this section of the poem, ends with another quotation
from Shakespeare: Ophelia's parting words in <i>Hamlet</i>, "good
night, sweet ladies," and so forth.</p>

<p>"The Game of Chess" here, well, it has all sorts of complex
resonances. Eliot's certainly punning on some sense of stale-mating and
unions, sexual unions, that have gone wrong and that have left people
against each other in warring postures. As the poem proceeds in "The
Fire Sermon," we get more scenes of erotic impasse or worse, erotic
violence of different kinds. The scene of the Thames, the water that
flows through London, is now brought into focus again, not at London
Bridge precisely, but just the shore where, well, Eliot describes it
as:</p>

<blockquote>The river's tent is broken; the last fingers of leaf<br />
 Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind<br />
 Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.<br />
 Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.<br />
 The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,<br />
 Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends<br />
 Or other testimony of summer nights. [As it usually does.] The
nymphs<br />
 are departed.<br />
 And their friends, the loitering heirs of City directors;<br />
 Departed, have left no addresses.</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Here, Eliot's, you know, conjuring a kind of erotic debris that has
been left behind by these businessmen and their nymphs. As the poem
progresses, there are more images of erotic confusion and
desolation.</p>

<blockquote>But at my back from time to time I hear [on the bottom of
479]<br />
 The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring<br />
 Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.<br />
 O the moon [I should be able to sing this for you] shone bright on
Mrs.<br />
 Porter<br />
 And on her daughter<br />
 They wash their feet in soda water.<br />
 <i>Et O ces voix d'enfants, chantant dans la coupole!</i><br />
<br />
Twit twit twit<br />
 Jug jug jug jug jug jug<br />
 So rudely forc'd.<br />
 Tereu</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>Again, a kind of amazing linguistic vertigo as we pass from a bawdy
Australian soldier ballad about Mrs. Porter, which has all kinds of
obscene stanzas that your editor doesn't quote for you, to Verlaine's
image of children's voices singing under the dome in his
<i>Parsifal</i>, introducing another narrative and theme that recurs
throughout the poem: the grail story and the story of Parsifal.</p>

<p>The poem moves then with those--first of all, it's just those
sounds, which are the sounds of Philomel; here, you know, human voice
reduced to a kind of noise almost, to another anecdote: "Mr. Eugenides,
the Smyrna merchant / unshaven," who asks the "me" of the poem "in
demotic French / to luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel / followed by a
weekend at the Metropole." A proposition, it seems, and again a kind of
sinister sexual invitation. There then follows the extended scene
between the typist and "young man carbuncular," an ugly scene of sexual
emptiness and domination. And Eliot doesn't shrink from, you know,
representing this man in the most ugly – both visually and morally –
the most ugly terms, although the poem was indeed a lot uglier yet than
it is now. At the very end of it, after he's left and bestowed one
final patronizing kiss, the poem used to--or this section of the poem
used to end with a rhyme that he, you know, then stopped outside to
take a piss. That was excised, however, in the course of the poem and
is an unnecessary further registering of the degradation of this
scene.</p>

<p>Then the poem moves to, well, these inset lyric songs on [page] 482.
"The river sweats"; again, we're on the river. And we're given a kind
of image of Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Leicester – a potential
lover for the virgin queen – who are being carried downstream. And then
finally, another speaker emerges; this time, it seems, a woman,
speaking again in quotation marks:</p>

<blockquote>"Trams and dusty trees.<br />
 Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew<br />
 Undid me. By Richmond I raised my knees<br />
 Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe."<br />
<br />
"My feet are at Moorgate, and my heart<br />
 Under my feet. After the event<br />
 He wept. He promised 'a new start.'<br />
 I made no comment. What should I resent?<br />
<br />
"On Margate Sands.<br />
 I can connect<br />
 Nothing with nothing.<br />
 The broken fingernails of dirty hands.<br />
 My people humble people who expect<br />
 Nothing.'"</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<p>There's a kind of extraordinary metamorphosis of speaker here. We
begin listening to the sexual anecdotes of, presumably, one of these
nymphs abandoned by one of the city directors who has been had in the
park in Highbury, Richmond and Kew. There's been, it seems, an event:
perhaps, what--a pregnancy, an abortion? "'He wept. He promised ‘a new
start.' / What should I resent?'" That experience then shifts to
another location. There's a kind of mutation of the speaker going on.
"On Margate Sands" --it's just that location, and then, "I can connect
nothing with nothing." And now that phrase, "nothing with nothing."
"What's in your head? Nothing." Those lines and that motif recur. That
first person is like the first person of "A Game of Chess," as if that
woman had turned into that man. And "Margate Sands" locate the poem at
this moment at one of the places where, after working in the city and
succumbing to a kind of nervous breakdown, Eliot went to compose parts
of <i>The Waste Land.</i> So, there's a way in which he, too, the poet,
is that first person there, merged with these other first-persons who
finally then merge with Queen Elizabeth when we hear that first person
say, "My people humble people who expect nothing." Again, there's a
kind of shifting and metamorphosis of identity as people are brought
into relationship with each other through their shared experience of
erotic failure.</p>

<p>Let's see, not too many minutes left to talk about the end of the
poem and to give some sense of its shape. Here's a kind of narrative of
the poem. "The Burial of the Dead," the title, it comes from the
Anglican <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>. It suggests that the poem will
search for, perhaps itself try to substitute for, the kind of ritual
understanding of life and death that the Anglican <i>Book of Common
Prayer</i> provides; again, some kind of collective meaning. "A Game of
Chess" then specifies the poem's problem as erotic impasse, as a kind
of stale-mating, as the failure of love.</p>

<p>"The Fire Sermon" then proposes a kind of solution. From the
Buddhist teaching, self-control is a way to combat lust and domination,
the selfishness of desire – all of which resonates in a moral register
with the poetic program of "Tradition and the Individual Talent" where
the theme is self-extinction or self-submission. The point in the
middle of the poem where I've been dwelling for the past few
minutes--the point is to convert the fires of lust into refining and
spiritualizing fires. Then there's a kind of <i>scherzo</i>, that
little section "Death by Water," where the drowned Phoenician sailor
seems to, well, be a kind of sacrificial figure meant to represent,
again, iconographically, self-extinction. And then finally, after this
emblematic sacrifice, we are introduced to the long final section "What
the Thunder Said," when there is a return of divine speech and the
promise of rain and of water, what the poem seems to be looking for:
aligning the redemptive regeneration that would come with the rain with
the experience of divine speech made present here in that simple
syllable, "<i>Da</i>."</p>

<p>Let me say just a couple things about the shape of the poem as we
have it. I've asked you to look at Pound's work on the poem in the form
of some pages from <i>The Waste Land Manuscripts</i>. Well, Pound
collaborated in the writing of this poem by, in particular, excising
and shortening the poem at many points and specifically, if you study
the drafts, by, I think, isolating those moments in the poem where
Eliot is drawn to a kind of Romantic lyricism. On what becomes the
first page of the poem, "April is the cruelest month," Pound circles
the word "forgetful": "with forgetful snow." In the passage about
Philomel, he circles the word "inviolable" for "inviolable voice."
Pound wants to get the Romanticism and lyricism of the poem out of it
in certain ways. Eliot resists that, and there are ways in which these
two men working together and against each other to create the poem
enact some of the poem's own struggle with lyricism and with
Romanticism and help us to see that struggle as part of what goes into
the creation of the poem itself.</p>

<p>One of the sections that Pound had the biggest effect on was "Death
by Water," which was originally a long, heroic narrative or mock-heroic
narrative ending in the sailor's drowning. That short section is worth
dwelling on for a moment because it is an instance where we are given,
I think, an image of what Eliot was giving up. He is giving up a
certain investment in romance quest and, more generally, Romanticism
that's emblematized by this drowned figure. There's also a way in which
this very short section points us to and makes us think about the
shortness of the poem as a whole. <i>The Waste Land</i> is the shortest
long poem in the language. It is, you know, a kind of radically
condensed epic. And there's a kind of, you could say, claim made by the
poem's form that epic extension and duration are no longer possible,
just as romance quest is no longer possible, precisely because we lack
the kind of culturally shared vocabulary and language that would allow
Eliot to create a kind of continuous form. Instead, what we have is a
radically condensed and discontinuous form; the brokenness of the
poem's form representing the brokenness of a world that doesn't have a
sacred center.</p>

<p>Finally, there's the matter of those notes. They are, I think, an
important part of the poem. They kind of get lost in the editor's notes
in your anthology. Well, when Eliot first published the poem it didn't
have those notes, when he published it in England in <i>The Dial</i>
magazine--excuse me, in <i>The Criterion</i>. When he published it in
America shortly after, he added those notes to extend the length of the
poem; he was asked to make a longer poem. There's a way in which those
notes establish a particular kind of figure, a poet who is also a
scholar and an editor, who is producing a poem that needs notes and
that needs to explain itself in these ways, and that draws on literary
tradition and various forms of cultural knowledge that require
annotation. Eliot presents himself as this figure, a poet who is also a
kind of scholar. And this figure emerges as a kind of central modern
figure, replacing the epic poet of the past, the one who produced a
poem such as <i>Paradise Lost</i> without any footnotes.</p>

<p>Well, Hart Crane responds to all of what I've been talking about
today and uses it as a point of orientation to create a related but
very different kind of poetry, as we'll see on Wednesday.</p>
