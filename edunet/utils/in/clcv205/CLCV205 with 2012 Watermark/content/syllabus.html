<h4>Requirements:</h4>

<p class="lastParagraph">Students will have an opportunity to choose one of two programs for completing their work in the course:

<p><strong>Plan A</strong>
<br />Students electing Plan A will take an in-class midterm and final examination.  The midterm will cover all assigned readings to that date.  Students in this program will also submit a paper on Herodotus, not to exceed 1500 words.  The topic for the paper will be announced in class.  </p>
						
<p><strong>Plan B</strong>
<br />Students electing Plan B will take an in-class midterm and final examination and will enroll in discussion sections which meet once a week for fifty minutes.  These sections will offer the students an opportunity to discuss in detail issues raised in the course.  Students in Plan B are encouraged to propose topics for discussion to the teaching fellow who will lead the discussions.  Students following Plan B will submit a paper, not more than 1500 words long, on a topic of their own choosing, subject to the approval of the section leader.</p>
<p>Students in Plan B are required to attend their section meetings regularly and to come prepared to discuss the topic announced the week before by the section leader.  Classroom participation will be one factor in determining grades.

<h4>Grading:</h4>

<p>The grades for students electing Plan A will be determined by computing the average grade on the paper, the midterm examination and the final examination; all three will count equally. </p>
<p>Grades for students electing Plan B will be determined by weighing the midterm, final and paper grades at 30% each and performance in section at 10%. </p>
