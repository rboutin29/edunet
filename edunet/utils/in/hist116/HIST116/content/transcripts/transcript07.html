<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>Last
week we ended with the Boston Massacre in 1770, and I mentioned at the very end
of the lecture the ways in which both onlookers in the British government and
the colonists ended up wondering, each one, if the other one was somehow
engaged in a plot. Right? And I mentioned that the British were perhaps
wondering if this had all been a plot to rob the customs house; the colonists
were wondering about the possibility of this being some kind of ongoing plot to
subdue and repress the American colonists. So clearly at the end of the lecture
from last week you can really begin to sense a growing sense of mounting
hostility, even among some people a sense of growing alienation. </p>
<p>And you can hear this
on both sides coming from the accounts of the Boston Massacre by both Gage and
Adams--and I read from them last week. And I did mention in class when I read
from them that they were of course writing with a purpose in mind so they were
interested in being particularly bold and dramatic in what they were saying.
Gage really had to excuse what happened and Adams was trying to promote people
to get upset about what had happened, but even so you can hear even just in the
way that they framed their accounts some of what I&#39;m talking about here with
growing hostility, growing alienation. </p>
<p>So for example, Gage
at the very start of the letter that I read from in the last lecture tells the
person he&#39;s writing to that he&#39;s writing this letter to inform the King&#39;s
ministry, quote, &quot;of the critical situation of the troops and the hatred
of the people towards them.&quot; That&#39;s how he starts his letter, which is
really interesting. So to Gage, clearly, what he&#39;s stating in this letter to
his people back home within the King&#39;s Ministry is that it doesn&#39;t really even
feel safe for British soldiers on the streets of Boston; the people here hate
us. </p>
<p>And Adams also
emphasizes this kind of growing alienation and animosity, and in his case he
does it in a particularly strong way in a series of newspaper articles for the <i>Boston
Gazette </i>that he wrote a few months after the massacre. So Adams writes: &quot;I
appeal to the common sense of mankind. To what a state of misery and infamy
must a people be reduced! To have a governor by the sole appointment of the crown;
under the absolute control of a weak and arbitrary minister, to whose dictates
he is to yield an unlimited obedience, or forfeit his political career [correction:
existence]: while he is to be supported at the expense of the people, by virtue
of an authority claimed by <i>strangers</i>.&quot; And that&#39;s really an interesting
statement. Strangers--He&#39;s referring to Parliament. Right? It&#39;s these
strangers who are telling these officials what to do. That&#39;s again a striking
word and a striking statement. </p>
<p>Now of course, here
Adams says that really striking thing--and then he&#39;s careful to add right after
it that [correction: in another article shortly thereafter], quote, &quot;For
opposing a threatened tyranny we have been not only called, but in effect
adjudged rebels and traitors to the best of kings.&quot; OK--He&#39;s making a
really important distinction there. He&#39;s saying, &#39;Yes, maybe we&#39;re upset at
what Parliament is doing, maybe Parliament is behaving like a group of strangers,
but we are still good British subjects and we are loyal to our King, to the
best of kings.&#39; And it&#39;s an important point, that even in the midst of all of
this animosity and all of these misunderstandings, troops are in Boston streets
and the colonists obviously still feel like British subjects who are loyal to
their King and who are objecting because their rights as British subjects are
being violated. That&#39;s the logic that we&#39;re working on here. </p>
<p>And you can see this
in Adams--Samuel Adams&#39; actions. At the same time that he&#39;s writing all these
sort of propaganda newspaper accounts and trying to stir up animosity, he also
was writing letters to people in England trying to persuade them and hopefully
inspire them to persuade others that the people of Boston were rightfully
defending their liberties and deserved to be defended by people in Parliament,
not condemned and punished. Equally important, the colonists were not saying
that they wanted nothing to do with Parliament, or even that Parliament had no
authority over the colonies--even though the occasional bold statement sort of
runs out on an edge and says &#39;we hate Parliament.&#39; </p>
<p>Most colonists
thought that the colonists--the colonies were subordinate to Parliament in some
way. The problem, Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson later remarked, is
that subordination, quote, &quot;was a word without any precise meaning to
it.&quot; Okay? That&#39;s a really insightful comment. Yeah, okay, colonies are
subordinate but what does that mean? And obviously what we&#39;re looking at now
is a sort of non-debate debate in which it&#39;s clear people have different
understandings of exactly what the imperial system is supposed to look like and
how it functions. </p>
<p>So all in all it&#39;s
important to remember here that even with all of this friction that we&#39;re
seeing between colonists and the British, the colonists are still loyal British
subjects who want the imperial system to function happily again. And this is a
really great example of why it&#39;s always important--and I think it&#39;s particularly
important when studying anything in the founding era, but I think history
generally--but when studying the Revolution or the founding era--but when
studying the Revolution, it&#39;s important not to jump on to the independence
bandwagon too quickly and assume that a separation is inevitable, because the
people that we&#39;re studying did not assume that. It&#39;s so easy for us to assume
that, right? Because we know it&#39;s coming--but remember Freeman&#39;s Top Tips for
Studying the Revolution, right? Contingency. </p>
<p>Our historical
subjects didn&#39;t know what was going to happen--and anything could have happened.
So from our perspective, we&#39;re looking at the events here-- we almost can&#39;t
help it, I think on all of our parts, even on my part. It all looks like a
ticking clock, like there&#39;s an inevitable pulling away from the British, and
everything I talk about here represents one step closer to independence,
another step closer to independence. And part of what I&#39;m trying to say here is:
clearly that&#39;s not how the colonists or the British at this point are thinking.
That&#39;s not how they understand their actions. That&#39;s not how they understand
what&#39;s happening. The colonists at this point are not trying to rebel and
they&#39;re not trying to retreat away from the British empire. They&#39;re trying to
fix things. They&#39;re trying to figure out how to fix things. </p>
<p>So in a sense, the
best way to understand the events of the first half of the 1770s is to look at
the whole revolutionary era without thinking about the Revolution, and by that
I mean the war. Just forget that there&#39;s going to be a war. The war doesn&#39;t
exist. I--Always as a historian I do this to myself when I&#39;m sitting down to
write something, like if I&#39;m writing a project--as I&#39;m working on a book now
that takes me up to the Civil War, so I have to constantly say, &#39;Civil War? I
don&#39;t know if they had a Civil War. What Civil War?&#39; Because my subjects
aren&#39;t assuming until a very late point that there might be one. And I&#39;m sort
of saying the same thing here, that it&#39;s useful to just sort of put the
assumption that there&#39;s going to be a war over here and watch the logic of
events as they unfold. It&#39;s a good reminder I think for the study of history
generally, because part of what you&#39;re trying to do as historians is understand
what your historical subjects are thinking and why they&#39;re thinking that way,
and you make that much harder when you stick the outcome right in front of them
and compare what they&#39;re doing with what you assume to be an inevitable outcome.
</p>
<p>Okay. Now I mentioned
last time that one way in which the colonists responded to the Townshend Acts
was to propose boycotting British goods again, as they had before--in their
minds successfully--with the Stamp Act. So now, feeling even more threatened,
the colonists didn&#39;t simply urge a boycott in an informal way. Now they
actually organize. So remember there&#39;s a pattern I pointed out in an earlier
lecture when I was talking about previous attempts at colonial union, and I
mentioned in that lecture that one of the main things that really drives the
colonies to join together in an effort is some kind of a threat--so basically
self-defense is a really good motivator. </p>
<p>And so typically in
the past something would threaten the colonies, inter-colonial unity suddenly
seemed important, there&#39;d be some kind of a movement to do something together
for the moment, and then when the crisis passed the unity passed as well. So
we&#39;re sort of seeing some of that go into operation here. Way down the road for
Americans, one of the big lessons of the Revolution would ultimately be how
powerful it is when you combine and organize and associate--when you form
associations or organizations--and as we&#39;ll begin to see soon, when people
organize into small coordinated groups, they can have an enormous impact--and
that&#39;s essentially what happens here in the course of the American Revolution. </p>
<p>So between 1768 and
1770, as they begin to contemplate boycotting British goods yet again, people
begin to form non-importation associations, okay? Non-importation associations.
Now these associations--these organizations in a sense--were extra-constitutional,
so they&#39;re springing up from outside of the formal political system, but in a
variety of different ways they actually had some real power. In the North, merchants
were at the core of this movement, this non-importation association movement,
although it was grounded on popular support, but merchants were really at the
center of it because one key to the success of this whole endeavor was for
merchants to join together in promising not to import British goods. And
sometimes merchants actually signed written agreements that they would not
import British goods, so unity among the merchants could be a powerful thing
and in the North that operated pretty effectively. </p>
<p>So for example, when--And
I swear I&#39;m really not inserting Rhode Island into every moment in which a
random bad thing happens. Today we have two--at least two--several Rhode Island
moments, and every time I come across one I think, is it just because I&#39;m aware
of Rhode Island? Is it because I&#39;m thinking about Rhode Island that Rhode
Island appears to be there so much? But it makes me think of--I got my
undergraduate degree at Pomona College in California, and Pomona has a thing
about the number forty-seven, which they think appears everywhere, right? Everything
is forty-seven, so when you go to Pomona, it&#39;s like the magic of forty-seven
constantly being talked about. You add letters up to various things, and it
always equals -- ooh!--forty-seven, and then people graduate from Pomona and go
on to become film writers and then you&#39;ll see all these forty-sevens.
Everyone&#39;s like: there&#39;s another one in Star Wars; it&#39;s a forty-seven! So forty-seven
was the Pomona thing and after a while you begin to think well, if I&#39;m looking
for forty-sevens I&#39;m always going to find forty-sevens. So today I actually--when
I was writing this, I thought, maybe I&#39;m doing that to Rhode Island. I hope
not, but here is a Rhode Island moment, okay? And it&#39;s an actual Rhode Island
moment. </p>
<p>Some Rhode Island
merchants threatened to pull out of the non-importation agreement because it&#39;s
proving to be troublesome in a variety of ways, so when these Rhode Island
merchants threatened this, merchants in Boston and New York and Philadelphia actually
imposed a boycott on Newport and Providence, Rhode Island. Right? Okay.
There&#39;s the power of association. &#39;Oh, you&#39;re going to--think you&#39;re going to
import British goods? Okay. We boycott you, Rhode Island.&#39; [laughs] &#39;You&#39;re
now going to be boycotted.&#39; That&#39;s pretty powerful. So merchants were key here,
as was the public. </p>
<p>So for example, in
various places in the North, colonial legislatures sometimes passed resolutions
commending these non-importation associations to the people. Right? The people
are vital too. So you have colonial legislatures passing resolutions to the
public saying, this whole association effort here is good and you should really
listen to it, basically lending legitimacy to what were essentially really ad
hoc organizations, ad hoc committees. </p>
<p>Now in the South, the
non-importation associations were more centered on the populace, not quite as
centered on merchants, so southern non-importation associations were often very
careful to have members sign on from throughout the community, so not just
merchants but artisans and planters. And because in the South they were more
popularly based, they were more centered on non-consumption than on non-importation--but
of course if you&#39;re looking at the North, it&#39;s all about seaports and importing
goods. It makes sense that in the South, maybe there&#39;d be more of a focus on
not consuming imported British goods, as opposed to not importing British
goods. </p>
<p>Now as suggested in
the comments that I just made about northern legislatures supporting northern
non-importation associations, it&#39;s important to note that these are not
rebellious groups acting against the structure of colonial government. They&#39;re
not competing with colonial assemblies. They&#39;re actually in some ways acting in
harmony with them, and as a matter of fact some people who were in these
non-importation associations probably were in the colonial legislatures too. So
we&#39;re not talking about opposing efforts. We&#39;re talking about sort of parallel
efforts that sometimes intersect. </p>
<p>Okay. So as
organizations linking the will of the people with politicized action, these
associations are pretty significant because--I&#39;m sure you can see now just
based on my description of them--they&#39;re really promoting broad, popular,
organized, coordinated politicized action. And this model is going to become
more and more significant as the Revolution continues on. And broadly based as
they were, these associations really did help to spread a sense of popular
involvement in resistance to British policy. </p>
<p>Boycotting British
goods was a political act and everyone from all levels of society including
women could be involved in this in some way, spreading a real sense of popular
involvement in acts of resistance to these seemingly unfair acts of Parliament.
So average people--we&#39;re not just talking legislators and political radicals
like Samuel Adams--but average people had a sense of involvement in a larger
cause. And newspaper articles and broadsides helped spread this sense of
involvement, urging the colonists to avoid luxuries like imported silks or
English rum, and instead people should be virtuous and they should wear
homespun clothing made of cloth that could be made in the colonies, and they
should drink whiskey and beer and cider that could be made in the colonies. </p>
<p>Now you&#39;ll notice
things to drink include whiskey, beer and cider, but you&#39;ll notice water [laughter]
isn&#39;t included in that list--and actually it wasn&#39;t considered a normal
beverage at this point in time, which I always thought was an interesting fact.
And when I was in grad school I read this really interesting British novel
written in 1796. It has a very strange title. The title is <i>Hermsprong; Or
Man As He is Not. </i>There were a lot of novels at the time called <i>Man as
He is, Man as He is Not--</i>but what <i>Hermsprong </i>is about, among other
things, is: the central character is this American in England, and he&#39;s this
sort of exotic, strange, independent-minded creature. And two things that he
does that are sort of shockingly bizarre to all of the British onlookers in
this novel is: he walks places instead of riding in a carriage. &#39;Oh, my gosh.
He got up this morning from the tavern and went walking.&#39; And then the second
even more horrifying thing is: he drinks water. [laughter] He drank water. He
had a normal dinner. He drank water. And there&#39;s a weird scene in it in which
someone says, &#39;I can&#39;t even describe to you what water tastes like. Why do you
drink it? Water has no taste.&#39; &#39;Water tastes like,&#39; Hermsprong says, &#39;water.&#39; [laughs]
Water tastes like water. That was kind of radical. So, being very patriotic
here, drink whiskey, beer and cider, period. [laughs] Don&#39;t worry about that
boring water stuff. It&#39;s fascinating that that&#39;s considered a weird thing at
that time. </p>
<p>Okay. So people are
encouraged to drink and wear only colonial-made goods, and this was true all
over the place. So as a symbolic gesture, Harvard students gave up drinking tea.
Students at the College of New Jersey, now Princeton, wore homespun clothing.
And students at Yale [laughs]--I wonder what this says about Yale--renounced
imported wines. [laughter] Huh? [laughs] I actually went and double-checked
that. I was like: really? [laughter] Yeah, really. [laughs] Yale. Okay.
South Carolina assemblymen renounced the wearing of wigs and stockings--which
must have looked very odd--with the result one observer noted, that a foreign
visitor arriving in Charleston, quote, &quot;would probably from their dress
take them for so many unhappy persons ready for execution who had come to
petition for a pardon.&quot; [laughter] Some of these people with no wigs and
no--kind of dressed really badly and hanging out in the legislature. Okay. </p>
<p>So clearly, based on
those examples, even Yale students, non-import--although maybe I don&#39;t know
about the--[laughs] not having imported wine. Non-importation does represent
one way in which many people, and as I said before including women, became
directly involved in colonial protest efforts. But women were often the
primary purchasers of goods, so their actions were central on this front. They
had to be appealed to, they had to be included, so non-importation politicized
the daily activities of women as well as men, spreading feelings of
community-level patriotism with people joined in a joint political effort to
defend their rights. So you have people who are sort of joined in this effort
of patriotic austerity; they&#39;re all sort of joining in a willingness to
sacrifice luxuries for a worthy cause. Now of course not every American and not
every colonist is doing this, so when I say &quot;joined, everyone&#39;s
joined,&quot; maybe not everyone, but there were a lot of people who were
paying attention to this idea of non-importation. </p>
<p>But of course, now
that I&#39;ve made non-importation sound so impressive, I will add that it ultimately
was not a roaring success because, as I just hinted a minute ago, not everyone
really found it very easy to surrender English luxuries, and as always there
was a lot of smuggling. So it wasn&#39;t an amazing roaring success but that said,
there was some impact on British manufacturers and there was some recognition
that considering the relatively small amount of revenue being raised by the
Townshend Acts, maybe the effort wasn&#39;t worth all of the trouble. </p>
<p>So some onlookers in
Britain began to regret the Townshend Acts. And it&#39;s important to note even Members
of Parliament who were sympathetic to the colonies and who wanted the Townshend
Acts repealed--even these sympathetic Members didn&#39;t question the right of Parliament
to tax the colonies. They may have felt that Parliament was behaving too
aggressively or unwisely, maybe it&#39;s an unwise policy, but even people who were--considered
themselves sort of supporters, real dire supporters of the American colonists,
even they were not questioning the constitutional supremacy of Parliament to
tax the British colonies. That&#39;s almost like a line in the sand. </p>
<p>So along these lines,
despite the fact that you have some people in Parliament who are sympathetic
towards the colonies, Parliament could not just back down and take all of the
Townshend Acts back, and there are two main reasons for that. There&#39;s such
power when you say that: &#39;there are two reasons&#39;--and a hundred people go
&quot;gonk.&quot; Satisfaction. Note-taking. But there are two main reasons.
First and most obvious, Parliament just didn&#39;t want to lose face. Right? They
felt that they truly were upholding the supremacy and sovereignty of the
British Parliament. Second, related to that and perhaps more important as far
as our understanding of different--two evolving mindsets is concerned, the
sovereignty of Parliament over the colonies by this point had become
inextricably bound up with the right of taxing Americans. And I&#39;ll repeat that
again. By this point, the sovereignty of Parliament over the colonies had become
inextricably bound up with the right of taxing American colonists. </p>
<p>So at this point, Parliament
couldn&#39;t back down on a tax without seeming to give up their sovereignty over
the colonies. By 1770, the right of taxation was not just a means of producing
revenue for the British, but it actually had become an assertion of British
sovereignty over its own colonies. </p>
<p>Okay. So now we&#39;re in
1770 and surprise, surprise, by this time we have a new Prime Minister. Lord
North is now Prime Minister. Townshend is gone, although we&#39;re sort of in a
period of revolving doors of Prime Ministers, but in this case Townshend died.
Townshend actually died back in 1767 and so Lord North is the next person who
comes along. Townshend&#39;s Acts live on without him for a little while, but now
Lord North is the Prime Minister so he assumes this position and with familiar
logic he decides that the only way to withdraw the Townshend Acts is going to
be to leave behind a token tax in the colonies to prove that England reigned
supreme over its colonial properties. As Lord North himself put it, </p>
<p>&quot;If I thought I
could appease that factious and disobedient temper which prevails [in the
colonies], I should be glad to do it. And yet, to these people, who ought to
be our subjects, we are to make concessions, because they have the hardihood to
set us at defiance! . . . Upon my word, if we are to run after America in
search of reconciliation, in this way, I do not know a single act of Parliament
that will remain.&quot; </p>
<p>But despite having
said all that, North concluded this speech by saying he wanted to be, quote,
&quot;thought, what I really am, to the best of my conviction--a friend to
trade, a friend to America.&quot; Okay. There&#39;s a lot of stuff bound up in
that statement--but you can really see him processing through what&#39;s happening
versus what he assumes about the workings of the imperial system. It&#39;s a
complicated situation to North and the British as well as to the colonies. </p>
<p>So in the end,
thinking about all of this and thinking well, I need to leave some kind of tax
in place to prove Parliamentary supremacy, he decides to leave the tea tax in
effect, and the logic behind that is, of all the taxed items this was the most
profitable to England, and it couldn&#39;t be manufactured in the colonies, so it
would have to be imported--plus it was kind of central to socializing.
Everybody drank tea. That was the thing to do--was to drink tea with great
ceremony--among some people to have tea cups and tea spoons--so North just
assumed on a whole bunch of levels: can&#39;t be easily boycotted; they really like
tea in those colonies, just like us here; makes us a reasonable amount of
money; that&#39;s the thing that&#39;ll stay. </p>
<p>Now when I was
writing this lecture, I was thinking about that. I was thinking about tea and
tea ceremonies and the drinking of tea, and I suppose we all have in our mind a
sense of that being the case in England, but it was no less the case in the
colonies. And when I was--I guess when I was researching my first book I came
across a story. I&#39;m going to mention it now only because it relates to the tea
ceremony and this is my opportunity to tell this story. There will be random
moments when I just have to tell a story &#39;cause you guys are like hostages. [laughter]
It means I get to say whatever I want and I get to tell random stories--but
this actually does demonstrate the sort of ritual of tea drinking everywhere. </p>
<p>So the whole tea
ceremony was important in the colonies. I came across this account from a
foreign observer, actually from France. And he shows up in the colonies, and he
says in a letter to a friend that he&#39;d never quite seen anything like the
colonial obsession with serving tea. And he describes this visit that he paid
to a woman, and he said that he would take a sip and then she would immediately
refill the cup, so he couldn&#39;t figure out how to empty the cup. Basically, he
doesn&#39;t want any more tea [laughs] and he can&#39;t figure out how to make it stop
coming. &#39;I&#39;ll drink a little more fast. Maybe she&#39;ll&#39;--And he kept basically
trying out one thing after another and she kept refilling the cup--and then he
felt compelled to drink, because it was the proper thing to do--was to eat or
drink what he was served. He didn&#39;t know that the code in the tea ceremony to
stop tea from being poured was to place your tea spoon across the top of your
cup. Right? He didn&#39;t think about that, so at one point he&#39;s desperate,
because he just can&#39;t deal with any more tea. So she pours more tea in his cup
and when she turned away he actually swallowed everything in the cup in a gulp
and then put the cup in his pocket. [laughter] Like she&#39;s not going to
notice. [laughs] Right? Oh, you ate the cup. [laughter] And he doesn&#39;t say
what happened. He just describes putting it in his pocket like: There. Now I&#39;ve
settled that. Great thinking. [laughter] They were serious about tea
ceremonies. </p>
<p>Okay. So with full
knowledge of the cultural importance of tea in the colonies, North left the tea
tax in effect, hoping that a slight concession on the part of England maybe
would chip away at colonial unity. Right? Maybe some colonists would be
convinced to stop resisting, maybe non-importation would thus collapse--and
eventually non-importation does collapse. It kind of dribbles to a close--1770,
1771. And as with the Stamp Act, both the colonies and the British
administration assumed that they had emerged from this victorious. Right? The
colonies think ha, we got most of those offensive acts repealed. Parliament
thinks well, we are still maintaining our sovereignty so our point stands firm.
And of course this did nothing to resolve the conflict about the precise nature
of sovereignty, the precise nature of the imperial system, and the precise
power of Parliament over the colonies. </p>
<p>At about this time,
however, Lord North once again, thinking about the colonies, attempting reform,
he&#39;s struggling clearly--You have to feel--I just feel bad for a Prime Minister
at this moment of massive confusion in the colonies. He&#39;s trying to figure out
some way to get colonial affairs in control, so at this point he figures maybe
one way to sort of calm things down is to focus on Massachusetts. Right?
Massachusetts is the pesky colony, bad things happen in Massachusetts, so he
says maybe one way to resolve things is to make a few little tweaks in their political
system. So he decides that henceforth Superior Court judges will be paid by tax
revenue collected by the Crown from the colonies, which means in effect Superior
Court judges are not going to be paid by colonial legislatures; they&#39;re going
to be paid by the Crown. Okay. </p>
<p>So certainly to some
people in Massachusetts this seemed like it&#39;s a way to make judges accountable
to British authorities and not to colonists, and in a sense that was part of
what North was trying to do here. But unfortunately about the same time, in
June of 1772, there was a crisis in Rhode Island. [laughter] A British ship,
the <i>Gaspee</i>, which was used in Rhode Island to prevent smuggling, ran
aground in Rhode Island and that night colonists swarmed aboard it, forced the
crew off and burned it to the ground. That&#39;s kind of a strong anti-British &quot;we
hate that you&#39;re stopping smuggling&quot; act. So the Crown responded by creating a
commission of inquiry to investigate the matter, and ultimately this committee
decides it&#39;s going to let this slide, which is a major concession because [laughs]
burning one of His Majesty&#39;s ships is a serious matter. Right? It&#39;s not a minor
crime. </p>
<p>Even so, colonists
just took offense at the existence of the commission which seemed to interfere
with the internal affairs of a colony, and even worse--this gets back to
something that people have been upset about in the colonies before--the
commission would have sent the people who were going to be tried to England for
their trials, right? So--and this also feels like a threat to self-rule. So
you have these sorts of things going on. They&#39;re individual acts. They&#39;re not
connected, but they&#39;re--in the eyes of many colonists not good things. </p>
<p>Samuel Adams,
brilliant propagandist that he is, decides there has to be an immediate
response to these new encroachments on colonial rights and it needs to not just
be in Boston. There needs to be a widespread inter-state protest to what&#39;s
happening and to the implications of what&#39;s happening. So in November of 1772,
building on the whole model of the non-importation associations, he suggests in
the Boston town meeting that a committee of correspondence be formed in Boston
to communicate the current state of affairs in Boston to the rest of the colony
and, quote, &quot;to the world&quot;--right? He&#39;s ambitious, Samuel Adams--and to
solicit responses. So a committee of correspondence of roughly twenty-one men
is created with the purpose--as stated in the Boston town meeting--of stating,
quote, &quot;the rights of the Colonists and of this Province in particular, as
men and Christians, and as subjects&quot;--which is an interesting trio--as men, as
Christians and as subjects, and &quot;to communicate and publish the same to the
several towns and to the world as the sense of this town, with the infringements
and violations thereof that have been, or from time to time may be,
made.&quot; Right? Infringements that have been made or <u>may</u> be made,
right? So he&#39;s even--Something else is going to happen, and if it is, we&#39;ve got
a committee of correspondence in place. </p>
<p>So by the end of
November of 1772, the committee had produced an open letter to all of the towns
in Massachusetts urging them, quote, not &quot;to doze or sit supinely indifferent
on the brink of destruction&quot;--that Samuel Adams; he&#39;s really a master at the
strong words--and to create their own committees of correspondence. And more
than half of the towns in Massachusetts responded, encouraging more widespread
participation in the controversy than before, more widespread willingness to
act alongside the normal political system to protest what people saw as an
unconstitutional act--and there were more than eighty of these local committees
of correspondence created within just a few months. </p>
<p>One observer called
these committees, quote, &quot;the foulest, subtlest and most venomous serpent
ever issued from the egg of sedition.&quot; And you can kind of see this
person&#39;s fears. Right? This is a person who sees what he perceives to be as
organized resistance to the British government sort of bubbling up in
Massachusetts. And this sort of bubbling committees, these committees of
correspondence are going to be spreading sedition, according to this person,
throughout the colonies and possibly to the world. And this person had a right
to be suspicious, because organized resistance is partly what these committees
are all about. </p>
<p>So this unfolding of
events in Massachusetts led radicals elsewhere to do what Massachusetts had
done, and create their own committees of correspondence for communication
within colonies and between the colonies. So within roughly a year, by very,
very early in 1774, there were committees of correspondence in almost every
colony. And these committees did a number of things. They strengthened ties
between radical colonies like Massachusetts and less active or less-radical
colonies, and they created a way for radical-minded people in different
colonies to interact with each other. So clearly these committees of
correspondence--just like the non-importation associations--are an important
stepping-stone in the growing sense of colonial unity. </p>
<p>Now it was at this
moment that Lord North passed the Tea Act. It actually had less to do with the
colonies than it had to do with a miserably timed necessity. North was trying
to save the East India Tea Company from collapse. The Tea Act of 1773 removed
import duties on East India tea, which basically made British tea cheaper than
Dutch tea, in the hope that this would inspire colonists to purchase British
tea. Okay. So you would think and certainly you can understand why Lord North
would think that this would make the colonists happy because he is lowering
duties on tea. The East India Company hopefully, as he&#39;s thinking, would be
solvent, maybe the Townshend Act, my little tea tax left in place there, is
going to matter less because I&#39;ve just lowered duties on some tea, so maybe now
the colonists will pay the tea tax, Parliament will obviously have the right to
tax the colonies in their eyes, and maybe this will actually quiet things a
little. </p>
<p>But once again the
British government misjudged the colonial reaction--again showing how you have
different evolving mindsets here and they&#39;re not necessarily, either one,
understanding what&#39;s happening in the other case. So the colonists not
surprisingly had their own interpretation of the act. They actually felt that
the act was granting a monopoly to the East India Tea Company, enforcing the
control of the British government over what they felt like was supposed to be
free trade, so maybe in the future the British would begin to control the
importation of other goods as well. </p>
<p>Okay, so somewhat
paradoxically by reducing the duty on English tea, North helped fuel colonial
fears that there was a plot in England against colonial rights--which inspired
the colonists to imagine the worst immediately when a suspicious act was passed.
So: &#39;oh, this must be part of that plot, this Tea Act. Yes, he may seem to be
lowering the duty on tea. There must be another motive. Ah, they must be trying
to control our trade.&#39; You can sort of see on both sides how the logic makes
sense. You can also see how this is a problem. </p>
<p>As with the Stamp
Act, colonists responded by pinpointing the people who would be distributing
the tea, right? So first, you didn&#39;t want to be a stamp agent; now you don&#39;t
want to be a person selling tea. So they pinpointed the merchants who were
selling tea and they pressured them not to sell it. And broadsides were posted
in public places to inform and involve the populace, saying things like: &quot;Friends!--
Brethren!-- Countrymen--that worst of plagues, the detested TEA, shipped for
this port by the East-India Company, is now arrived in this Harbour; the Hour
of Destruction, or manly opposition to the Machinations of Tyranny, stares you
in the face.&quot; It&#39;s a big drama. These are not people who do things halfway:
destruction--staring you in the face--tyranny--manly opposition. </p>
<p>So when ships loaded
with tea began arriving in major colonial ports, obviously things become more
heated. In some cities the tea was just unloaded and then locked up in a
warehouse and left there, not sold. In Philadelphia and New York they actually
kept these ships with tea on them out away from the harbor, so that they just
never came in close to shore. However, in Boston [laughs] Governor Hutchinson
decided to force the issue, in his mind as a means of protecting British
sovereignty in the colonies. So Hutchinson ordered the tea ships to be
unloaded. </p>
<p>Okay. So we have an
eyewitness account of someone who heard the response to that announcement, who
heard what happened when it--people heard that Hutchinson was going to ask for
the tea to be unloaded and it was at a Boston town meeting: December 16, 1773.
Basically, people knew that there was this tea-bearing ship in the harbor, and
they knew that on December 16, in the evening, the captain of that ship was
going to go to the town meeting and tell the town meeting--Samuel Adams who was
chairing the meeting--what was going to happen with the tea. People knew that,
and thus there was an enormous crowd gathered outside of the Old South Church
where the meeting was being held to see what would happen. Right? So everyone
knows this is the stare-down. Okay. What&#39;s going to happen? Is the tea coming
off the boats? And if the tea&#39;s coming off the boats, what happens next? Big
crowd, and here&#39;s what this eyewitness heard as the crowd learned that
Hutchinson was insisting on the unloading of the tea. </p>
<p>So this eyewitness,
he&#39;s at home drinking tea [laughs] when he said, I heard &quot;such prodigious
shouts. . . that induced me, while drinking tea at home, to go out and know the
cause of it. The [meeting] house was so crowded I could get no farther than the
porch ...You&#39;d [have] thought that the inhabitants of the infernal regions had
broke loose. For my part, I went contentedly home and finished my tea.&quot; [laughter]
What&#39;s going on? I got to go finish my tea. [laughs] &quot;But was soon informed
what was going forward.&quot; Right? Is soon told they&#39;re going to unload the tea, &quot;but
still not crediting it without ocular demonstration&quot; [laughs] okay, eighteenth
century: I wanted to see it for myself, right? But not crediting it without &quot;ocular
demonstration,&quot; I went to watch. </p>
<p>Okay. So our
eyewitness goes off to get ocular demonstrations of the unloading of the tea,
but what he ends up watching is an assemblage of somewhere between thirty and sixty
men disguised as Indians aboard three ships on Griffin&#39;s Wharf, and these men
basically worked on those ships for several hours and threw 342 chests of tea
over the side. A huge number of people watched from the docks and, as I
mentioned before when I was talking about the Stamp Act, riots and popular
demonstrations were kind of a regular part of the system in the colonies. Riots
were not normally chaotic moments of violence and disorder unless you were shingle-by-shingle
taking apart [laughs] the house of the stamp agent for example, but usually
they were almost ritualized demonstrations of protest. </p>
<p>So what we have here
is not a wild riot on these ships. Protestors were so careful not to do
anything other than make their point, not to do anything other than destroy
tea, that allegedly they brought a locksmith with them to open locks or repair
locks that were broken. These are people who understand property rights. Right?
&#39;We value property. We don&#39;t want to break your locks.&#39; They&#39;re not actually
out to get the ship owners; they just want the tea. So they actually were very
orderly about the way in which they went to destroy the tea. </p>
<p>So to give us a sense
of what happened, I&#39;m going to use an account by another man. His name is
George Hughes. He actually helped destroy the tea, so he&#39;s one of the people
throwing chests of tea over the side. And in his account, Hughes says that back
at the Old South Church, the announcement that Hutchinson was going to order
the unloading of the tea led to, quote, &quot;a general huzzah for Griffin&#39;s
Wharf.&quot; A huzzah is an eighteenth-century hooray: &#39;hooray, off to
Griffin&#39;s Wharf.&#39; So these guys were like: You&#39;re going to unload the tea?
We&#39;re there [laughs] and something bad is going to happen. </p>
<p>So Hughes, a
participant in what would come to be known--but not until well into the
nineteenth century--as the Boston Tea Party, continues his account. He says,
&quot;It was now evening, and I immediately dressed myself in the costume of an
Indian equipped with a small hatchet. . . with which and a club, after having
painted my face and hands with coal dust in the shop of a blacksmith, I
repaired to Griffin&#39;s Wharf where the ships lay that contained the tea,&quot; and
Hughes is ordered to go to the captain and &quot;demand of him the keys to the
hatches&quot; because they don&#39;t want to damage the ship, &quot;and a dozen candles&quot; so
that they can see what they&#39;re doing. [laughs] Right? Just being very sort of
polite here. &quot;The captain promptly replied and delivered the articles but
requested me at the same time to do no damage to the ship or rigging.&quot; So
these Indians cut and split the tea chests with their tomahawks and threw them
overboard. There were some people who tried to climb on board the ship to scoop
up tea to take back home with them. This was not a wise thing to do because
they were caught and their hats and wigs were dumped in the water with the tea
and they were kicked away, literally. The crowd sort of just kicked them away
from the ships on the wharf. </p>
<p>So Hughes concludes
his account by saying, &quot;We then quietly retired to our several places of
residence, without having any conversation with each other or taking any
measures to discover who were our associates,&quot; right? Because they&#39;re all disguised.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Nor do I recollect
of our having had the knowledge of the name of a single individual concerned in
the affair. . . . There appeared to be an understanding that each individual
should volunteer his services, keep his own secret, and risk the consequences
for himself. No disorder took place during that transaction, and it was
observed at that time that the stillest night ensued that Boston had enjoyed
for many months.&quot; </p>
<p>So, not wild abandon.
It&#39;s a pretty controlled riot. </p>
<p>However, Lord North
was dumbfounded because he really thought he had given the colonies what he
called a &quot;relief&quot; instead of an oppression, and he assumed that only what he
called, quote, &quot;New England fanatics&quot; would have rebelled against his
measure. So this event, this tea event in Boston, is proof to him that the
issue no longer is one of taxation but now this appears to him to be more about
whether Britain had any authority over, quote, &quot;the haughty American
republicans at all.&quot; </p>
<p>And this is an actual
transcription of part of the parliamentary debate over what to do after this
was discovered. North said, </p>
<p>&quot;The Americans
have tarred and feathered your subjects, plundered your merchants, burnt your
ships, denied all obedience to your laws and authority; yet so clement and so
long forbearing has our conduct been, that is--it is incumbent on us now to
take a different course. Whatever may be the consequence, we must risk
something. If we do not all is over.&quot; </p>
<p>And another Member of
Parliament said he thought, quote, &quot;The town of Boston ought to be knocked
about their ears and destroyed.&quot; [laughter] Okay. &quot;I am of opinion you will
never meet with that proper obedience to the laws of this country until you
have destroyed that nest of locusts.&quot; Okay. Boston is not popular in Parliament.
Another member said--we&#39;re moving back in to arrogant British quotation
territory--</p>
<p>Lord North could not
do &quot;a better thing than to put an end to their town meetings. I would not have
a man of a mercantile cast every day collecting him--themselves together, and
debating about political matters. I would have them follow their occupations as
merchants, and not consider themselves as ministers of that country. . . . You
have, Sir, no government, no governor, the whole are the proceedings of a
tumultuous and riotous rabble, who ought, if they had the least prudence, to
follow their mercantile employment, and not trouble themselves with politics
and government, which they do not understand.&quot; </p>
<p>[laughs] Okay. Go
back to your regular jobs, guys. Don&#39;t mess in government. What are they
doing? Why are they doing this? They&#39;re merchants. They&#39;re not politicians,
and look what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re messing up the imperial system. </p>
<p>Okay. The result of
that kind of sentiment would be the passage of four acts that Americans termed
the Intolerable Acts, passed in Parliament in the spring of 1774. And I&#39;m so on
the cusp of running out of time. I think what I will do is pause there since
we&#39;re just about out of time for class. We will continue. We will add the
details of the Intolerable Acts and then move in to the logic of resistance,
which is going to look at how this is adding up to an ongoing logic in the
colonial mindset. I&#39;ll stop there. </p>
