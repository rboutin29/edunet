<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>Before
we begin, I have to make a true confession to you, my class, because you&#39;re my
class, and I have been confessing things all semester but this is--I basically
set myself up for this failure and then realized--at the end of the class
someone came up to me and asked me a question, and then I realized--Gaa! Okay.
So remember how I told you how at UVA for five straight years I forgot Thomas
Jefferson&#39;s birthday, even though everything closed? Yeah. Guess what I didn&#39;t
say on Tuesday? I forgot it was Thomas Jefferson&#39;s birthday. [laughter] I
completely forgot. Someone came up at the end and said, &quot;Well, in honor of
Jefferson&#39;s birthday we did the following&quot;--and I was like [laughs]. So
it&#39;s good to know that I&#39;m really consistently a horrible UVA grad [laughter]
who always forgets Thomas Jefferson&#39;s birthday. It must be a Hamiltonian mental
block [laughter] that I--it is not possible for me to keep that date in my head.
Anyway, I at least wanted to say, happy birthday, Thomas Jefferson. So now,
officially, I&#39;m a little late, but he&#39;ll get over it--so anyway [laughter] I&#39;ve
confessed to you. I feel much better now. </p>
<p>Okay. So today we
turn to the Constitution. In the last few lectures and in today&#39;s lecture
basically we&#39;ve been looking at the new nation figure out its shape and form,
right?--what kind of a nation is this going to be. As people were discovering
throughout the 1780s, it was one thing to protest against things that you
didn&#39;t like in a government, as the Americans had during the Revolution. It was
quite another thing to come up with an alternative, to come up with something
better and then to get others to agree. Today&#39;s lecture, I&#39;m sorry--Tuesday&#39;s
lecture discussed part of this process of figuring out the shape and form of
the new nation. So we looked at the Mount Vernon Conference, we looked at the
Annapolis Convention, and we--in doing that, we&#39;re looking at a gradual process
that was unfolding one step at a time with no inevitable outcome. So basically,
what we saw on Tuesday was how the Americans were basically backing their way
into what would become the Constitutional Convention. So it&#39;s not as though
everyone said, &quot;Hey, we need a new constitution and it&#39;s got to be stronger.
Let&#39;s go.&quot; Right? They&#39;re--It&#39;s a process at which people are really figuring
things out as they go. </p>
<p>And today I want to
stress that same message: that the Constitution was not inevitable. And I know
that&#39;s obvious on the one hand, but on the other hand, it&#39;s so ingrained in us,
I think, to think that it&#39;s a great idea that of course would happen sooner or
later, that I feel the need at the outset of the lecture to say this, that
obviously it was not inevitable. We think to ourselves: well, of course the Articles--what
a goofy government the Articles of Confederation was; of course they&#39;ve got to
come up with something better; of course it&#39;s going to be stronger; of course
it&#39;s going to end up looking like our Constitution. And obviously the problem
with that whole river of &quot;of courses&quot; is that if you travel down that
stream you miss one of the most important aspects of the process of creating
the Constitution, and that is that it was a process, that it was a debate. It
was a national debate during which people really seriously considered what they
were doing, what the implications were of what they were doing, and they did
not all agree on what was a good or bad idea. </p>
<p>So the process, the
fact that there actually was a debate, is significant. And it&#39;s not a process
that was entirely disconnected from the Revolution. The things that Americans
had been yelling about during the Revolution--right?--they talked in a variety
of different ways about liberties; they talked in a variety of different ways
about rights--that wasn&#39;t just rhetoric. People were truly arguing about and
defending specific fundamental rights and privileges that they felt they
deserved as British subjects, and of course the end result about that fight was
the Revolution. </p>
<p>So now we&#39;re years
later, and we&#39;re looking at arguments over a new form of government, and some
of these same things are being yelled about. So, as you&#39;re going to see in the
course of today&#39;s lecture, in one way or another people are still fretting
about sort of what they consider to be fundamental liberties, basic rights.
People considered these things to be the legacy of the Revolution and they
didn&#39;t want to give them away before they&#39;d even really begun to enjoy them. </p>
<p>So think back for a minute--many
moons ago; it&#39;s so long ago in the semester--but think back to when we were
talking about the vote for independence, and I mentioned Pauline Maier&#39;s book.
And I talked about how in her book she has a chapter in which she talks about
the other declarations of independence, and she really shows how on a local
level people were getting together and debating as groups in towns, in
counties: what do you think about independence and should we actually support
this?--that that was actually a real debate. And what I&#39;m talking about here,
what I will be talking about over the course of this lecture, it&#39;s a similar
process of debate in which people throughout the country were really trying to
figure something out. They knew it was a major decision. They were hoping
whatever was going to happen was going to be a smart decision, but it&#39;s an
actual debate. </p>
<p>And along these
lines, as you&#39;ll see by the end of today&#39;s lecture, this is not the kind of
lecture in which I&#39;m going to give you this deep textual analysis of the
Constitution. Basically, I&#39;ve got this lecture and a little bit of the next
lecture to talk about the Constitution. I&#39;m sure the Founders are spinning in
their graves like: &quot;what, forty-five minutes to give to the Constitution?&quot;--but
that&#39;s where we are in the semester. Given that I only have that amount of
time, what I really want to focus on is the process of creating the
Constitution, and in doing that I&#39;m also going to talk about a handful of
ongoing controversies that we have seen before during the Revolution in an
earlier part of this course, and we&#39;re going to see them again toward the end
of this lecture when we focus on some of the main areas that became
controversies for the Constitutional Convention. </p>
<p>Now I think in the
same way that we have all these &quot;of courses&quot;--of course we know
what&#39;s going to happen, it&#39;s the Constitution--I think it&#39;s also easy for us to
walk down the &quot;of course&quot; trail when we think about nationalists like
James Madison or Alexander Hamilton. On some sort of basic level, we assume
well, they&#39;re right, right? They&#39;re the smart guys; they&#39;re right, and anyone
who is against them is sort of a shortsighted, limited-minded person who
clearly isn&#39;t thinking on a broad, smart level. Right? I think almost
instinctively because we think what we think about our Constitution, we think
that way about whoever supported it or did not. </p>
<p>Now certainly, these
nationalists felt like they were vindicating the Revolution, right? So if
you&#39;d asked them, they would have told you that they felt they were preserving
the achievements of the Revolution; they were fending off chaos and a variety
of other things that would defeat what had been won in the Revolution. And from
our vantage point, we can look back, we see that, and that makes sense, but
this wasn&#39;t the only argument that was circulating at the time. So even before
the Constitutional Convention met, people had valid fears about what might
result from it, and they were fears that were strong enough that some people
didn&#39;t even think their states should participate in the Convention. Never mind
arguing about ratification. I&#39;m backing us way up. There were many people who
just thought: &#39;I don&#39;t want to--I don&#39;t think our state should participate in
this whole idea of revising the government.&#39; In some way or another, some
people feared that strengthening the national government was a kind of
counterattack against everything that the Revolution had meant. </p>
<p>And I want to give
you a sense of the flavor of this debate, this actually sort of pre-Convention
debate in which the states are figuring out what to do, and I&#39;m going local
again. Right? I sort of--To give you a sense of on-the-ground reality during
the Revolution, I went local when I talked about the invasion of New Haven. So
for just a couple minutes here I want to go local again and just give you a
flavor of the debate that was going on here in Connecticut after the
Confederation Congress had passed a resolution saying: okay, we think that the
states should select delegates to send them to this Convention that&#39;s going to
happen to revise the articles. Right? They&#39;re not saying, &#39;Go destroy the Articles&#39;--but
they are saying, &#39;Okay. Revising the Articles might be okay&#39;--and once the
Confederation Congress makes that resolution, the states now debate what to do.
</p>
<p>So on May 12, 1787,
the Connecticut legislature began debating whether Connecticut should send
delegates to this proposed Convention to meet in Philadelphia that was coming
up in a couple of--was coming up very soon as a matter of fact. Now most
newspapers that reported on what happened explicitly mentioned four members of
the Connecticut House who came forward and declared that they were opposed to
sending delegates to the Convention. All of these men were from small towns near
the Massachusetts border. And all of them in one way or another warned that
sending a delegate to this Convention would endanger the liberties and
privileges of Americans. </p>
<p>So Elijah Fitch--I
love the fact that their names are preserved--Elijah Fitch said the Convention
might end up abridging the people&#39;s privileges by creating some kind of a big,
unjust, centralized government that just wouldn&#39;t consider the individual
person at all. Daniel Perkins said that the men who probably would be named as
delegates to this supposed Convention would probably be a bunch of rich,
aristocratic-type men who wouldn&#39;t understand or care about the problems of the
average person in Connecticut, never mind the poor of Connecticut. So Perkins
thought, whatever comes out of this Convention is bound to just ruin the poor;
it&#39;s going to be some weird, aristocratic decision. Hosea Humphrey said that
the Convention would probably somehow or other take away the rights of
Connecticut to protest against things, to veto things; somehow or other it&#39;s
going to be more centralized, so Connecticut is going to lose power in this
equation. And the fourth representative, named Abraham Granger, was
particularly straightforward. He said, he knew that his constituents didn&#39;t
want delegates to be sent to this Convention and he represented them, so first
of all, there it was. He had no choice; he had to just do what they wanted him
to do and say, &#39;No, we should not send delegates to the Convention,&#39; but he
added, he agreed with them. He actually thought that this Convention was a bad
idea, and he stated specifically, the reason why he didn&#39;t like the whole idea
of a Convention was probably it would end up creating a monarchy, and then we&#39;d
be right back to where we were before. </p>
<p>So all of these men,
either directly or by implication, clearly they&#39;re rejecting the idea that the Union
or Connecticut is in such horrible shape that something must be done; we need a
new government. They&#39;re not traveling down that trail. Granger actually in the
course of his remarks explicitly said that the Confederation Congress had
plenty of power; the Articles of Confederation joined with Connecticut&#39;s own
constitution would be just fine for the people of Connecticut. </p>
<p>Implied in some of
the comments of what these men said is the idea that anything could happen at
this Convention, and obviously that&#39;s something I&#39;ve talked about before in
this course as well, but you can hear it underlying a lot of their comments.
Who knows what&#39;s going to come out of this Convention? Anything could happen
and odds are whatever happens, some fundamental American privileges and rights
are going to be taken away, potentially by a bunch of wealthy, aristocratic
guys who are going to be the ones standing in that room in Philadelphia
debating. So they&#39;re basically imagining the Convention&#39;s going to be a bunch
of aristocrats who are going to subvert a popular revolution and maybe even
just toss the new country right back into a monarchical form of government. So
those are the four people who at least the newspapers noted as really standing
forth against the Convention. </p>
<p>Now of course, the
newspapers also reported on nine men who spoke in favor of attending the Convention.
All of them were from commercial areas. They all argued, as you would expect
them to argue, that the well-being of the Union and the well-being of the state
of Connecticut really, really required a stronger central government. One of
these nine even brought up an embarrassing example of how powerless the Congress
was that involved Connecticut. He said, &#39;You know, recently, the Confederation
Congress asked the states, including Connecticut, that they requisition money
from us, and we just decided we didn&#39;t feel like giving them any, and they couldn&#39;t
do anything. Remember? [laughs] They asked us for something and we said no
and that was the end of that. Remember, guys? Oh, that&#39;s like a sign; they
don&#39;t have power because we watched them not have power when we just said no.&#39; And
he--this one delegate went on to say, &#39;Well, what about--Think about it. That&#39;s
not even a problem. What about problems to come? What if the Union begins to
disintegrate? What if the Union is invaded? What would the Confederation
Congress be able to do about problems like that?&#39; </p>
<p>So obviously in the end,
it&#39;s that kind of an argument that wins out and Connecticut voted to send
delegates to the Convention, but obviously also not without a real debate. So
even participating in the Convention was a big deal that required serious
debate, and we haven&#39;t even gotten to ratification yet. As a matter of fact, it
was such a big deal that one state, the state of Rhode Island--Rhode Island is
consistent throughout my entire class--Rhode Island decided not to attend. They
actually just decided: no, we&#39;re not participating, we&#39;re not going. So there
were actually only twelve states represented at the Constitutional Convention.
Rhode Island was a holdout. So clearly, so serious that one state is just not
there. </p>
<p>So ultimately twelve
states sent delegates to the Federal Convention. And I should add here, just
to not confuse you, sometimes I know I&#39;m saying Federal Convention and
sometimes I&#39;m saying Constitutional Convention, and they&#39;re two ways of
referring to the same thing. Some historians say Federal Convention because if
you think about it, every state could have a constitutional convention but
there can actually be maybe, hopefully one Federal Convention, but you can use
either one. You have my full permission to call it either the Constitutional
Convention or the Federal Convention. </p>
<p>So twelve states sent
delegates to the Federal Convention. It met between May and September of 1787.
Rhode Island obviously, as I said, was not there. From those twelve states, fifty-five
delegates attended the Convention in all. And I suppose, as you might expect,
overall they were well-educated men. A lot of them were trained as lawyers. A
lot of them had experience working in their state governments. A good number of
them had experience serving in either the Continental Congresses or the
Confederation Congress. </p>
<p>Now that said, this
doesn&#39;t mean that these were sort of professional politicians sitting down to
write a constitution. It&#39;s not as though they&#39;ve prepared their lives for this
moment. They&#39;re people who&#39;ve been involved in public life but they certainly
have not been training to sit down and create an entire constitution for a
whole country, so despite that experience, which I&#39;m sure served them well, it
does not suggest that they actually are just ready to go. They&#39;re not entirely
sure what&#39;s going to happen. </p>
<p>Now in some ways,
these delegates were kind of a self-selecting group, because people who were
really dead set against the idea of strengthening the national government
basically just didn&#39;t go to the Convention. The problem with that strategy is--on
the part of certainly the people who didn&#39;t like this whole idea--by not being
there, they made it easy to achieve a consensus among the people who were there
who were a little more comfortable with strengthening the national government.
Most of the people who were there in one way or another ended up being
nationalists in some form, and by nationalists I actually don&#39;t just mean the
James Madisons of the world. There&#39;s a pretty wide spectrum of people thinking
about the fact that the national government needs to be stronger and some of
them, Hamilton, Madison, extremo nationalists, others not so much--there&#39;s a
pretty wide range--and there were some people at the Convention who weren&#39;t
even necessarily comfortable with a great amount of increased strength and did
not end up signing the Constitution. So I&#39;m not saying everyone there is a firm
nationalist. But the really firm, I suppose you&#39;d call them at this moment
anti-nationalists, didn&#39;t go for the most part. So since they were not there,
it meant that there was a certain sort of fundamental level of agreement at the
Convention. </p>
<p>Now two of the
delegates there were particularly well known, and to people who were wondering
what the heck was going on in Philadelphia, the presence of these two men made
a big difference. George Washington. George Washington was there. George
Washington ended up presiding over the Convention, which ended up being a
pretty important move. I&#39;ve already talked in past lectures about how he gained
the trust of everybody by continually surrendering power, so he&#39;s already a
legend in his time, but also he&#39;s a trusted leader. So certainly having him
there gave a certain status to whatever was going on, meant that it was
important, and meant that it was something that was being treated responsibly
because George Washington had invested it with his presence. </p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin
also attended. Again he&#39;s another man in this period that--an American who had
an international reputation. I&#39;ve talked a little bit about him as well, and
like Washington his presence there suggested that whatever the heck was going
on in Philadelphia, it was important and it had some major support. The fact
that these two men were there was significant. This is not the reason why he
was there, but I also am always happy when anyone is anywhere who has a sense
of humor, so Franklin had one, and it&#39;s always good to have the guy with a
sense of humor at any large meeting of men who have important things to say. So
for that reason I personally am happy that Benjamin Franklin was there. </p>
<p>Now as I suggested on
Tuesday, Madison also played a major role, and I talked at the end of Tuesday&#39;s
lecture about his amazing notes that he recorded partly thinking ahead to
posterity. His notes ended up being even more significant because it was agreed
at the start of the Convention that its proceedings would be kept entirely
secret. The logic of that being that if it was really, really kept entirely
secret, the people who were there would feel free to really speak their minds.
They really wanted an open, full, honest debate, so if people there really
believed that the public would not know what they were saying, someone for
example might feel free to stand up and say, &#39;I personally would like a monarchy.&#39;
Right? If people thought the public was watching, no one&#39;s going to utter the &quot;m&quot;-word
at the Constitutional Convention, but if it&#39;s really secret, the idea was it
would allow for much more open and free and potentially useful debate. </p>
<p>And there&#39;s actually--I
can&#39;t resist. There&#39;s actually a story about the secrecy of the Federal
Convention which I will offer you because it&#39;s also a George Washington--yet
another George Washington story. I can&#39;t resist it. And it&#39;s actually--it
really is a way of showing how important people at the time considered the idea
of keeping the Convention secret. And it&#39;s from the notes of a delegate who was
there at the convention and his name is William Pierce. And supposedly at some
point in the Convention, somebody found a page of notes about the proceedings
on the floor of the state house and brought this up to George Washington and
said, &quot;Somebody lost these.&quot; Okay. So Washington takes the lost
notes and at the end of that day&#39;s session he stands up and he says,
&quot;Before we adjourn--&quot; I&#39;ll read his precise words: </p>
<p>&quot;Gentlemen, I am
sorry to find that some one Member of this Body has been so neglectful of the
secrets of the Convention as to drop in the State House a copy of their
proceedings, which by accident was picked up and delivered to me this Morning.
I must entreat Gentlemen to be more careful, lest our premature speculations
disturb the public repose by getting into the newspapers. I know not whose
paper it is,&quot; </p>
<p>and then he said
&quot;but there it is,&quot; and he sort of threw it down on the table and
added, &quot;Let him who owns it take it.&quot; And according to Pierce, he
bowed, picked up his hat and left the room, quote, &quot;with a dignity so
severe that every Person seemed alarmed.&quot; Okay, the power of George.
Right? He just sort of threw his weight around and everyone&#39;s like: uh oh. </p>
<p>So Pierce writes that
immediately everyone started checking their pockets and their notes, like: &#39;I
really hope those are not my notes; please don&#39;t be my notes.&#39; Pierce says to
his horror he discovered that his were lost, so he kind of goes up to the front
of the room, and he kind of peeks at the notes and he&#39;s really relieved to
discover: they&#39;re not mine. Okay. That means that his notes are lost; [laughter]
that means two people&#39;s notes are lost. And Pierce then later says that he
remembered, oh, yeah, I left them in my coat pocket in the boarding house where
I&#39;m staying--and he found them and got them and hopefully everything was okay.
But I love the fact that he&#39;s really relieved like: oh, good, at least those
aren&#39;t my notes; they&#39;re someone else&#39;s really lost notes. And according to
Pierce, Washington&#39;s reprimand was so off-putting that nobody ever claimed the
piece of paper. [laughter] It will just stay there, [laughs] the scary piece of
paper. </p>
<p>So obviously
Madison&#39;s notes are important also partly because this was very secret, but of
course, as I hinted at the very end of Tuesday&#39;s lecture, what&#39;s particularly
significant about Madison&#39;s role in the Convention is his creation of a plan of
government which ultimately is known as the Virginia Plan. Madison arrived at
the Convention with a plan of government in hand, so in a sense he immediately
set the terms of debate. It was a really strategic move--and I&#39;ll add at this
point that when you go off in to the future and have wonderful jobs that in one
way or another will require you to have committee meetings of various sorts,
the little lesson, the life lesson that James Madison teaches us here is, if
you set the agenda of the meeting, you set the terms of debate and you make it
much more likely that you win. Right? So remember James Madison down the road
in your professional lives. </p>
<p>He really does
something very brilliant strategically by walking in and regardless of what is
going to happen--he doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen, but he literally at
least started out by setting the terms of debate. Now he may have devised this
plan of government, but given that people already knew he was sort of an
extreme nationalist, he wisely decided he would not stand up and present this
plan himself, thinking--and probably rightly so--that if he stood up and made a
recommendation, some people would immediately distrust it as coming from some
kind of an extreme nationalist. So instead, he asked fellow Virginia delegate
Edmund Randolph to present the plan. And Randolph was popular and Randolph was
influential and unlike Madison Randolph was also a good public speaker so it
was a wise choice. </p>
<p>So on May 29, just a
few days after the Convention opened, Randolph stood up and very diplomatically
and very gently opened the subject of altering the Articles of Confederation. Though,
as you&#39;re about to see, what he ends up suggesting is not altering the Articles.
So first he reviewed the weaknesses of the Articles, and then he proposed a
series of resolutions, the first one intended to just calm the nervous down and
sort of put people off guard: nothing scary is happening here. So he first
says, &quot;Resolved, that the Articles of Confederation ought to be so
corrected and enlarged as to accomplish the objects proposed by their
institution; namely common defense, security of liberty, and general
welfare.&quot; So Randolph there says he&#39;s proposing to correct and enlarge
the Articles. </p>
<p>What followed that
statement was a rather radical plan of government that was not a correction of
the Articles. Instead it pretty much proposed to demolish the Articles and
create in their place a strong national government that would be grounded not
on the individual states, but instead on the people themselves. This plan of
government--the Virginia Plan is ultimately what it&#39;s called--proposed that the
new government would have three branches. The first would be a bicameral
legislature. The lower house would be elected by the people. The upper house
would be selected by the lower house from candidates named by state
legislatures. The legislature would have the power to nullify any state law
contrary to the Constitution, and representation--as I mentioned--in the lower
house is based on population. The second branch was the national executive. In
the Virginia Plan, the executive would have a qualified veto over acts of Congress.
The plan didn&#39;t specify whether the executive would be a single individual or a
committee. People talked about both. The term of office wasn&#39;t specified
either. And then obviously, the third branch was the national judiciary, which
would consist of one or more supreme judges and some inferior courts, to be
chosen by the national legislature to hold office during good behavior. </p>
<p>So I&#39;ll repeat that:
Bicameral legislature; lower house elected by the people; upper house selected
by the lower house from candidates named by state legislatures; the legislature
can nullify any state law that violates the Constitution; representation is based
on population. Branch two is the executive who has a qualified veto over acts
of Congress, and it&#39;s not specified--one person, many people, how long you
should be in office. And then the third branch, the judiciary, with one or
more supreme judges chosen by the national legislature holding office during
good behavior. The Virginia Plan also included a flexible amendment process and
a procedure for the admission of new states. </p>
<p>Now, as you can hear
there, the basic outline of the final Constitution is kind of sitting there in
that plan. A sort of fundamental frame of what&#39;s coming in the next few months
is contained within the Virginia Plan. </p>
<p>So from the start of
the Convention, things look a little auspicious for the nationalists, and sure
enough relatively early on in the Convention there&#39;s a vote that a new national
government ought to be established and it should have a supreme legislative,
executive, and judiciary branch. Now that&#39;s a pretty major thing to decide.
It&#39;s a pretty major victory for people who are really firm nationalists; that,
okay, the Convention now has committed to setting up a supreme central
government with three branches. And some more nationalist victories followed.
So for example, the Confederation decided that the executive would be one man after
debating this for a while--and I&#39;ll talk a little bit more about this toward
the end of the lecture--but they ultimately decided that one man should be the
executive, and clearly, in a world where you&#39;re scared of centralized power and
thinking about kings, that&#39;s a big decision. </p>
<p>And then they began
to discuss representation in the lower house of the legislature, and I&#39;m also
going to come back to representation in a few minutes. But for now I&#39;ll simply
state the obvious, which is: of course this debate broke down--as this debate
always breaks down--into small states versus large states, small states not
liking the idea of having representation be based on population, large states
being perfectly happy with that idea. And small states had a good reason to
fear that their influence would just be eliminated in some degree if everything
is based on population. </p>
<p>So on June 15,
William Patterson of New Jersey proposed his own plan, which becomes the New
Jersey Plan--it&#39;s another New Jersey moment, the New Jersey Plan--and of course
this is a plan that&#39;s much more popular among small-state representatives. The
New Jersey Plan suggested a one-house legislature in which obviously each state
would have one vote. There would be a plural executive--so an executive
consisting of more than one person--who would be elected by the Congress, and a
supreme court chosen by the executive. Now you can see how in some ways that
there are little vestiges of the Articles sitting there in that plan: there&#39;s a
unicameral legislature; each state has one vote. Even so, even though this is
supposedly a less centralized, less scary alternative to the Virginia Plan,
still it is giving more power to the national government than the Articles had
done. </p>
<p>Three days later, someone
successfully moved to postpone consideration of the New Jersey Plan and instead
consider simply revising the Articles. You can imagine the sort of
&quot;uh&quot; going around the room: oh, no. Now at this point, Alexander
Hamilton stood up and made a dramatic move. On June 18, he made what some
describe as a six-hour speech--I can&#39;t imagine giving or listening to a
six-hour speech--in which he proposed his plan of government, which as you&#39;ll
hear, is really, really, really, really centralized and national. </p>
<p>Basically, Hamilton&#39;s
plan reduced the states to administrative subdivisions. Each would have a
supreme executive appointed by the national government; a chief executive
elected for life during good behavior, elected by electors who were elected by
electors who were popularly chosen. Okay. How removed can we get the people [laughs]
from the process of choosing the executive? Hamilton also proposed a senate
chosen for life during good behavior and an executive with absolute veto power.
</p>
<p>Okay. That&#39;s way out
there in scary land. You can imagine--he gives a six-hour speech and that&#39;s
what he comes up with. He also during the speech praised the British government
as the best government on the face of the earth. Right? [laughter] That&#39;s
Hamilton. So basically Hamilton never lives down this speech. As a delegate
later put it, Hamilton&#39;s dramatic speech was &quot;praised by everybody, but
supported by none.&quot; [laughs] It was like: thank you; you can sit down
now. And it really did haunt him to the end of his days because it seemed to be
eternal proof to anybody who even vaguely didn&#39;t like him that he was really a
monarchist at heart--that he&#39;s just waiting for a chance to convert the
government into a monarchy with a king at its head. It&#39;s--You can see why it
was important to keep the proceedings secret and you can see how they did not
get--remain a secret for very long. Right? Clearly they leaked. If--this is like
the tin can tied to Hamilton&#39;s reputation for the rest of his life. Clearly
it&#39;s leaking, but--yeah, he never lived down that speech. </p>
<p>Now the question is:
why did he stand up and give that speech? Why did he stand up and praise the
British government as being the best government on the face of the earth? Why
did he propose this extreme plan knowing how people felt about some of these
ideas? And there is disagreement; there is not agreement on this. Some
historians assume that this was a strategic move, and that Hamilton was trying
to push the Convention past the weak New Jersey Plan or, horror or horrors,
just revising the Articles. So according to this strategy, Hamilton&#39;s plan
would have looked so extreme that the Virginia Plan would look really good in
comparison, and sure enough not that long after Hamilton&#39;s speech, the New
Jersey Plan is defeated, so if this is why Hamilton did this, maybe you could
say it worked. </p>
<p>However, it&#39;s equally
possible that Hamilton wanted at least a moment to stand up and offer his ideas
and basically state, &#39;Okay. Here&#39;s my plan of government. Here&#39;s my little
moment to shine. Here&#39;s what I think we should be doing.&#39; And I always feel--I
don&#39;t which of these is true or not true. I think either one could be or
actually both could be, but certainly the latter theory has a little credence
to it only because you have to feel sorry for Hamilton at the Convention. Here
is this guy who for roughly a decade has been saying we need a stronger
national government. He&#39;s one of the first; he&#39;s one of the strongest; he&#39;s
consistent; he&#39;s out there; this is his message. He finally gets the Constitutional
Convention and the other two delegates from New York do not like the idea of
really strengthening the national government very much--and it&#39;s one state, one
vote, so basically his vote doesn&#39;t matter at all. </p>
<p>So, this poor guy.
It&#39;s like: &#39;my mission, my mission; hey, finally I&#39;m here and... I can&#39;t do
anything.&#39; And it&#39;s like: aw, poor guy. So it&#39;s possible that he did actually
stand up and say, &#39;Okay, whatever. Here&#39;s what I would do [laughs]--and I&#39;m
going to announce this and never live it down--but here&#39;s what I would do
during this, what should be my prime moment.&#39; So for one reason or another--who
knows whether it was strategic or because he wanted his moment to lay out his
plan--the fact is that that night after he gave the amazing speech he did meet
with Madison and revise Madison&#39;s notes so that they would be an accurate
reflection of what he said just in case anyone didn&#39;t hear him praise the
British government as the finest on the face of the earth. [laughter] Okay. So
a little truth in both, I think. </p>
<p>Now I&#39;m about to do a
really, really grave injustice to the Constitution, and so now is the moment
when the Founders will be spinning in their graves, because I&#39;m going to
basically condense my discussion of the Constitution down to three main issues,
not because they&#39;re the only issues that should be discussed, but because
certainly they&#39;re all important issues, and because they show something about
how concerns--issues--of the Revolution continued to play a role in American
politics and in American public life. I apologize to all Founders for
condensing the Constitution down into mere minutes. </p>
<p>Okay. The first issue
that I want to discuss is representation. And the question here, the obvious
one: population or one state, one vote. Small state, big state battle. Small
states are afraid of having no influence, which they continue to be afraid of.
This is not a battle that stops once this decision is made. It continues on,
and in one way or another states are always sort of objecting. There&#39;s a
secession--potential secession plot by New England in the early nineteenth
century because they feel that they have no influence. So this doesn&#39;t go
away, but certainly at this point it&#39;s a real sticking point. And ultimately a
committee came up with a solution, which is known either as the Great
Compromise or the Connecticut Compromise, and the reason why it&#39;s the
Connecticut Compromise is because it was proposed by Connecticut delegate Roger
Sherman. </p>
<p>Roger Sherman is a
local boy. Yet again New Haven appears on the map. Roger Sherman lived in New
Haven and actually--You may have not have noticed it because I&#39;m probably the
geek who notices every historical plaque in the universe, but on the front of
the Union League Café there actually is a plaque to Roger Sherman. It was his
house. Here was his house and here is what he did and we like Roger Sherman. So
he&#39;s a New Haven guy. He&#39;s the guy who proposes the Connecticut Compromise and
basically, as you could predict, the compromise says representation in the
lower house will be based on population and in the upper house one state, one
vote. And that gets passed on July 16, 1787. </p>
<p>So representation,
first major issue. Second major issue--although in a way the problem with this
one is that it was not a major issue--is the question of slavery, which clearly
is linked to the question of representation. On August 8, Northern states
attacked slavery on moral grounds and proposed taking no account of slaves as
part of the population when allocating representation in the national
legislature. Now obviously many Southerners did not like this idea and they
defended slavery on moral and economic grounds, and they were joined by some Northerners
who were afraid that this issue was just going to dissolve the Union. </p>
<p>Gouverneur Morris of
Pennsylvania offers a nice sort of example of the anti-slavery point of view.
I&#39;ll quote Morris here: </p>
<p>&quot;Upon what
principle is it that the slaves shall be computed in the representation? Are
they men? Then make them citizens and let them vote. Are they property? Why
then is no other property included? The houses in this city [Philadelphia] are
worth more than all the wretched slaves which cover the rice swamps of South
Carolina. The admission of slaves into the representation, when fairly
explained, comes to this: that the inhabitant of Georgia and South Carolina,
who goes to the coast of Africa, and in defiance of the most sacred laws of
humanity, tears his fellow creatures from their dearest connections, and damns
them to the most cruel bondage, shall have more votes in a government
instituted for protection of the rights of mankind than the citizen of
Pennsylvania or New Jersey, who views with a laudable horror so nefarious a
practice.&quot; </p>
<p>Wow. That&#39;s a
statement--a strong statement. </p>
<p>Other side of the
argument: Charles Pinckney of South Carolina was among those who stood up and
tried to justify slavery. An example of his argument: He said, &quot;If
slavery be wrong, it is justified by the example of all the world. ... In all
ages one half of mankind have been slaves.&quot; And he cited Greece and Rome
and other ancient city-states, as well as sanctions given to slavery in modern
times. </p>
<p>So slavery is
mentioned, slavery has its moment of debate, but it is important to note, it
was in a sense a little more than a moment. It only occupied a few days. The
issue was recognized to be a deal breaker, and when the delegates held up their
concern over slavery against the idea of forming a Union--so basically when
they saw that if they really confront the issue of slavery, they may never get
a chance to confront the issue of union--they just decided not to confront the
issue at all. And they memorialized their inability to confront the issue in
the document, the Constitution itself, in Article I, Section 9 of the
Constitution, and Article I deals with Congress. It states that, quote,
&quot;The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now
existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress
prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight&quot;--which basically
says Congress can&#39;t stop the slave trade before 1808. </p>
<p>But look at how indirect
that language is. Right? It doesn&#39;t say what I just said in very simple terms.
The &quot;Importation of such Persons as any one of the States shall think
proper to admit.&quot; Can there be a more indirect way of referring to
slavery? They&#39;re tap dancing around this issue. They&#39;re finding one way or
another just not to confront it, so the word &quot;slave&quot;--the word
&quot;slavery&quot;--does not appear in the Constitution. </p>
<p>So basically faced
with a pretty fundamental moral problem, the delegates to the Constitutional
Convention looked the other way. In their minds, the Union was too tenuous for
anything this controversial to be addressed, and this kind of sort of skipping
out or not confronting the issue because it seems like the deal-breaker would
be seen again and again and again, and obviously eventually it becomes the deal-breaker
and it does contribute to the breaking of the Union. </p>
<p>Okay. So representation,
slavery, two large issues under debate or not under debate depending on which
one you&#39;re talking about. The third issue I want to bring up concerned the
national executive, and obviously that really had links to the Revolution. The Revolution
was a revolt against strong centralized power in the form of a monarchy and a
monarch. We&#39;ve seen in previous lectures how state constitutions that were
created in the 1770s really showed this ongoing fear of tyrannical centralized
executive power. So we&#39;ve seen, when we were looking at those state
constitutions, how more often than not legislatures were given more power and
governors were denied some power. It&#39;s the same fear, the same spirit that&#39;s
charging the debate during the Convention. </p>
<p>So questions about
the national executive came up again and again. How should he be elected? By
electors? By electors chosen by state legislatures? By state governors? By
the national legislature? By popular election? How long should he serve?
Proposals ranged from two years to life during good behavior. The ultimate
compromise suggested that the President would serve for a four-year term and it
didn&#39;t set a limit on how often he could be reelected. And he would be elected
by electors in the separate states, which reassured delegates who were worried
about state rights--and each state could decide for itself how to select its
electors. So if a state wanted to select electors by popular election, they
could. If a state wanted to have their legislature pick electors, they could.
Again, they&#39;re sort of allowing the states to come up with their own way of
doing this. States still have rights. But still, big, scary issue of the
executive. So in a way this--all of these sort of compromises and decisions end
up creating an executive who--at least it felt like he was being controlled in
some way every four years by having to face election. </p>
<p>Now in some ways,
considering everything that I just said about being scared of monarchy, kings,
America sort of slipping right back into a monarchy, this executive is granted
a surprising amount of power. He&#39;s Commander in Chief of the armed forces. He
could carry on diplomacy. He could recommend measures to Congress. He could
exercise a veto, although obviously it could be overturned by a two-thirds vote
in each house of Congress. Part of the reason for this amount of trust in the
executive was the idea of checks and balances. So people really actually did
believe in checks and balances and think that this isn&#39;t a single executive,
sort of scary and alone with no way to check his power--that the Constitution
actually seems to be kind of nicely balanced, so that maybe this person
actually has some restraints or some reins pulling him in. </p>
<p>Now obviously this is
the--I&#39;m--I feel so bad. Hamilton, Madison--I&#39;m so sorry. This is the most vast
overgeneralization of the Constitution that I can almost possibly imagine, and
I will come back to it because we have to get it ratified, which is part of
what we&#39;re going to do on Tuesday. But in the interest of time: on September
16, 1787, the Constitution was agreed upon. On September 17, it was signed and
sent to the Confederation Congress to pass along to the individual states so
that they could ratify it. And there needed to be nine states to ratify the
Constitution for it to go into effect, and each state would have its own
ratifying convention to decide the issue. </p>
<p>So what we&#39;re going
to be looking at, at least at the beginning of next Tuesday&#39;s lecture is this
second debate, which is: what do we really think about the Constitution? And
part of what we&#39;ll be pulling from that is, what kind of a sort of status check
does it show us about what Americans are thinking at the time? In what way do
the different arguments for and against tell us something about America at that
moment? So we&#39;ll see the sort of highly contested debate. We&#39;ll see states that
say no and then say yes. Rhode Island is still over here somewhere waiting to
see what happens. And it&#39;s really something that people are watching closely. </p>
<p>I&#39;ll talk a little
bit more about this on Tuesday, but I once again also turn to Ezra Stiles. I&#39;m
basically always looking for something that makes this real, so that it&#39;s not
just: the document, the debate, the Constitution. So Ezra Stiles&#39; diary--I love
Ezra Stiles&#39; diary, so I&#39;ll mention it a little bit more on Tuesday. But he
talks about what he thinks about what&#39;s going on, and he talks about watching
states ratify the Constitution. I&#39;ll mention some of that as well, because it
again, shows one guy that&#39;s kind of responding to what&#39;s going on in a really
interesting way. I will stop there. I will see you on Tuesday. Have a good
weekend. </p>
