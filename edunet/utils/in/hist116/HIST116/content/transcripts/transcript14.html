<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>Okay.
So we are now post midterm. We&#39;ve gotten past the midterm, which is excellent.
And what I want--the lecture I&#39;m going to give today is actually titled
&quot;Heroes and Villains,&quot; and I&#39;m going to explain what that means in
just a few minutes. I&#39;m going to segue, so I&#39;m just touching on one or two of
the things that I talked about at the end of the last lecture, segueing right
in to this lecture. </p>
<p>And hopefully you remember
that right before the midterm, the last lecture I gave, I was talking about the
process of organizing a war. And I talked about some of the problems that the
Continental Congress had in dealing with the Continental Army, and I at least
referred to some of the ways in which these problems hinted at larger problems
with unity between the newly created American states. </p>
<p>So for example, I
talked about regionalism, and I talked about some of the ways in which
regionalism complicated the task of organizing the Continental Army, for
example things like considering how to balance positions of military command
between Northerners and Southerners, or getting units from one region of the
country to deal with units from another region of the country, or getting soldiers
from different regions as well as individual soldiers to agree to sacrifice for
the common good throughout the entire confederation of states instead of
thinking about their own state or their own locality above all else. </p>
<p>And I also talked
about a related problem, and I called that the problem of localism, and I
talked about how a localized view of the world, or certainly a localized view
of the new states, worked against centralized control. So localities of all
sorts had difficulty surrendering local control to some kind of a central
organization like the Continental Congress, which obviously had to equip the army,
and thus that raised all kinds of other complications and problems. Each state
wanted to maintain control, for example, of its own militia. </p>
<p>And then finally, at
the very end of the lecture I mentioned that many people who would end up being
strong nationalists in the 1780s and in the 1790s--people who were going to end
up being at the forefront of the movement to strengthen the Articles of
Confederation--many of these people gained their political beliefs and the need
for some kind of a stronger centralized national government from their
experiences during the Revolution, from their experiences with what often felt
like what Alexander Hamilton called an imbecilic centralized government. That
was his word that he applied to the Continental Congress,
&quot;imbecilic.&quot; </p>
<p>So basically, looking
at the army and then looking at Congress, we see regionalism and localism both
working against centralized control and coordination. We see a lack of
precedent for centralized governance of this kind, which led to some confusion.
And certainly that made it possible for any important decision that had to do
with centralized power having seemingly enough importance to make it earth-shaking--and
thus seemingly trivial things ended up seeming to have huge importance because
they might set a precedent, again all of this working against effectiveness. </p>
<p>So all of these
things complicated the creation not just of a Continental Army, but also of
first, colonial unity, and then American unity and--as we&#39;re going to see in
weeks to come--ultimately constitutional unity. And we&#39;re going to see this
sort of concern and confusion and these complications of centralized power coming
up again and again this semester, particularly at the beginning of April when
we begin to talk about the Articles of Confederation and people really debating
about what&#39;s the best form of government for these new states to unite under.
So these ideas--things like regionalism and things like localism and how they
complicated the army, and also centralized power--those things are actually
going to come up in today&#39;s lecture which, as I said, I titled &quot;Heroes and
Villains.&quot; </p>
<p>And what I&#39;m really
going to be doing in today&#39;s lecture--It&#39;s a different kind of lecture from
ones that I&#39;ve given before. Happily for you, it&#39;s a lecture that will probably
require you to take less notes than you typically take in lecture for this
course, because what I&#39;m going to do is kind of use a case study to look up
close at just a handful of people and a series of events as a way of exploring
some of the ideas that we&#39;ve been talking about generally--ideas about the Congress,
ideas about the army, and how they actually played out in a few individual
lives. </p>
<p>So what we&#39;re going
to see in the course of today&#39;s lecture, which in a way is one big story, is
some of the complications inherent in how the Continental Congress handled the Continental
Army. We&#39;re going to see a very specific example of that. We&#39;re going to see
regionalism making trouble in the Continental Army. We&#39;re going to see how
serving in the army affected--in the case of today&#39;s lecture--several people&#39;s
lives in a really direct way. And then on a broader scale, by looking at this
one story--which is intertwined with the actions of the Continental Army and
what it meant to this handful of lives--we&#39;re also going to see some broader
truths about American society at the time. So we&#39;re going to see for example
how the army was an outlet for personal ambition, how people maybe tried to use
service in the army as a way to promote themselves, something that I&#39;ve
mentioned before. We&#39;re going to see how living at a time of war opened paths
for people that might not otherwise have existed. We&#39;re going to see the
sometimes slippery status of women during a time of war, and we&#39;re going to see
how many Americans still revered some British cultural ideals even in the midst
of war against Britain. </p>
<p>And the story that
I&#39;m going to use today, the sort of case study that&#39;s going to help us delve
into all of these things, is the story of Benedict Arnold, Peggy Shippen
Arnold, and John André. All of these people--All three of these people, in one
way or another, attempted to use the war and its armies to make, or I guess
maybe more accurately to unmake, themselves and their reputations. In one way
or another, all of them were trying to better themselves through the
opportunities of warfare. </p>
<p>Now before we launch
into that case study, I just want to talk for a moment about why warfare
created such opportunities for potentially raising a person&#39;s social status,
and thus why some people were actually eager for war. Now in some of the early
lectures for this course, I discussed social status in the colonies and I
talked a little bit about how society in the colonies, while it certainly did
have an elite sort of gentlemanly rank of people, that overall American society
tended to be more middling than English society, which did have an entrenched
aristocratic class. In America, if you wanted to have gentlemanly status--and
in a sense it was more difficult to be born into it in the way that you could
have in a European nation--there were actually a limited number of pathways
that were open to you to achieve that kind of a status. </p>
<p>Basically, there were
a handful of professions that were assumed in this period to be gentlemanly.
These included medicine, the law, the ministry, the church, perhaps being a
merchant that was wealthy enough that you didn&#39;t seem to be grubbing for money--that
you seemed to be living happily off of your vast sums of money, maybe someone
who owned a really sizable plantation, or serving as an officer in an army. And
I was sort of unsure what to do with college professors, near and dear to my
heart. I decided I would not officially put them on the list, although many
college professors in this period would have been in the clergy, certainly some
of them would have been lawyers, so I think they would have generally fallen into
the gentlemanly ranks, but I&#39;m being unbiased here so I&#39;m leaving college
professors over here somewhere. </p>
<p>Okay. So of all of
those positions that I&#39;ve just named, being a military officer, serving as an
officer during--in an army but particularly during a time of war, offered the
greatest chance for instant glory, instant status, instant rank through bravery
and displays of valor on the battlefield. For the very ambitious or for people
who had a problematic social rank for one reason or another, a war could be a
great opportunity for you to improve your place in the world, particularly in a
place like America. </p>
<p>And one extreme
example of this is actually Alexander Hamilton, who was born illegitimate in
the West Indies--and it&#39;s really clear from the absolute first letter of his
that we know of, which was written when he was fourteen years old, that he
absolutely thought that his only ticket off of the island of St. Croix was
through military glory in a war. That was really the way that he saw that he
was going to make something of himself, get himself off of St. Croix, earn a
name, get status, get reputation, and start the process of making something of
himself in the world. So as he says in this letter, and it&#39;s written when he&#39;s fourteen,
&quot;my Ambition is prevalent. ... I wish there was a War.&quot; Okay. [laughs]
As a historian, you&#39;re so happy--again, I said this before--when your
historical subjects say the thing you want them to say that you can then quote
forever after. &#39;Hi. I am ambitious and I want a war so I can promote myself.&#39;
Thank you, Alexander Hamilton, very much. </p>
<p>Okay. Now in a sense
Hamilton was extreme, because he was very underprivileged, he was extremely
ambitious and very determined, but in a sense his entire generation of young
men saw the Revolution as a chance for glory, status, rank, self-promotion. And
I talked about a similar idea last week when I mentioned that there were a
number of Europeans who came to America during the Revolution, sometimes
because they figured that they could probably impress Americans, or certainly
impress the Continental Congress with their experience in formal European
warfare, and then they could get a position as an officer easier than they
might have been able to obtain it or purchase it back home, and--so that there
were a number of Europeans coming to this country for that purpose. </p>
<p>And I mentioned at
the time that actually Hamilton, trying to do something really similar, said
that watching these Europeans come and get promoted by the Congress above his head
gave him what he called &quot;pigmy-feelings,&quot; made him feel really puny,
really small in comparison with these sort of grand Europeans coming and sort
of getting everything that he wanted and he wasn&#39;t getting because he was just
a puny, little American. So in a sense, in a world where there were a limited
number of pathways to gentlemanly status, serving as an officer during a time
of war could be kind of an escalator of rank, offering the chance to get ahead
at a rapid pace. So being an officer in the Continental Army could have seemed
particularly attractive to highly ambitious men who were looking for some kind
of a big chance, and Benedict Arnold was one of those men. </p>
<p>Now I think when most
Americans think about the American Revolution--And I remember I started out
this course sort of talking about the same idea. I assumed that maybe people
know Washington led the army, that Paul Revere rode around on a horse saying
something about the British, that Jefferson had something to do with the
Declaration of Independence, and I&#39;ll add to that list, most people know
Benedict Arnold was a traitor. They don&#39;t know why, they don&#39;t know how, but
you assume the name Benedict Arnold goes along with the word
&quot;traitor.&quot; </p>
<p>John Adams was pretty
much right on the money when he predicted how future generations were going to
see the American Revolution, and it&#39;s right in line with what I just said. And
he actually wrote in 1790 to Benjamin Rush, &quot;The History of our Revolution
will be one continued lie from one end to the other. The essence of the whole
will be that Dr. Franklin&#39;s electrical Rod smote the Earth and out sprung
General Washington. [laughter] That Franklin electrified [correction:
electrized] him with his Rod--[laughs] and henceforth these two conducted all
the Policy, Negotiations, Legislatures and War.&quot; Okay. So Adams is
actually probably coming pretty close to reality. People are going to look back
and they&#39;re going to say, &#39;Yeah, yeah. Franklin, Washington, and the war. That
was the Revolution.&#39; </p>
<p>Now I always--I knew
that quote. I&#39;ve known it for a long time. I love that quote, which is why I
found a reason to sort of wind it into today&#39;s lecture, but when I went back to
look it up today, for the first time I actually read the whole letter that it
comes from. And I found another sentence which I actually hadn&#39;t focused on
before, and it made me so happy that I offer it to you, even though it isn&#39;t
directly related to the point I&#39;m making, but I kind of couldn&#39;t believe he
wrote it in his letter. So he offers that quote and then he adds and says,
&quot;If this Letter should be preserved and read an hundred years hence--&quot;.
Okay. First of all, I love the fact that that comes up in his mind. Well, a
hundred years from now when people are reading my letter, &quot;if this letter
should be preserved and read an hundred years hence, the Reader will say, &#39;the
envy of this J[ohn] A[dams] [He] could not bear to think of the Truth!&#39;&quot; </p>
<p>So in other words, a
hundred years from now if people read this letter they&#39;re going to say, &#39;Yeah.
Well, the fact is Adams knew he wouldn&#39;t be remembered. He doesn&#39;t deserve to
be remembered anyway.&#39; So it&#39;s like first there&#39;s the letter where he&#39;s like: &#39;oh,
no one&#39;s going to know the truth about the Revolution and they&#39;re never going
to give me any credit. [laughter] I love the weird self-awareness of John
Adams. I just--I couldn&#39;t believe that he added that into the letter. So
anyway, I think he certainly knew what he was talking about when he talked
about the weird, general sort of hero-way in which people were going to be
thinking about the American Revolution. </p>
<p>So many Americans
know certainly Benedict Arnold equals traitor. Obviously, it&#39;s--I&#39;m going to be
talking about it today--his story is a lot more complex than that, and it&#39;s
mixed in with these other two stories, that of Peggy Shippen, who eventually
becomes his wife, and John André who is a young British officer. Now Arnold
started out life in many ways a sort of typical member of a modest, respectable
family, and at the opening of the American Revolution he was a book-seller and
a pharmacist, or what they would have called a druggist, in New Haven,
Connecticut. So he&#39;s a local boy, Benedict Arnold. He was struggling to better
himself. How many of you knew actually that Benedict Arnold was a local guy? A
couple people did. That was another one of those things that--I never know when
I say something about New Haven. Is it like, &#39;We all know this about New Haven,
Professor Freeman. You are the clueless person.&#39; [laughter] </p>
<p>So anyway, he was a
local boy. So book-seller, druggist, New Haven local boy struggling to better
himself, and part of the way in which he&#39;s struggling to better himself is to
certainly display himself to the world as someone who&#39;s really up and coming.
So among the things that he was doing was, he apparently was building an
enormous mansion for himself on Water Street, wearing very expensive clothing,
taking big risks in business to try and get himself ahead quickly. He was also
a captain in the local New Haven militia and so he was really active drilling
at the opening of the war. </p>
<p>Now when gunplay
broke out at Lexington and Concord, the New Haven town meeting apparently
decided that they wanted to maintain neutrality, which in and of itself was
kind of interesting. Right? &#39;Uh oh. Something bad&#39;s happening. I think for now
we want to be neutral.&#39; Connecticut&#39;s always a very conservative place so this
is yet another conservative moment in Connecticut&#39;s history. So they form a
committee--The town meeting forms a committee to preserve neutrality in New
Haven. Arnold was not really excited about this concept of neutrality, so
apparently he stormed in to this neutrality committee, demanded the keys to the
ammunition shed, and when his superior in the Connecticut militia told him the
town had legally voted for neutrality, Arnold threatened to break down the
ammunition shed door with his men if they didn&#39;t hand over the keys so he could
get ammunition and take his men and do something. And the committee released
the keys and Arnold took them and armed his men, and ultimately he and his
militia unit joined the Continental Army in Massachusetts. </p>
<p>So this is someone
who clearly is eager to fight. Right? He sort of forced his way in. So he ends
up in Massachusetts with his men. He&#39;s soon promoted to be a colonel by the
Massachusetts Committee of Safety, which assigned him to be part of a group
that was going to go help capture Fort Ticonderoga and he was--Arnold was part
of that successful effort in May of 1775. And by October of 1776, he was a
brigadier general. </p>
<p>Now at this point the
very hierarchical system of military rank that Arnold was using to try and
raise himself in the world began to work against him, because a number of his
equals were promoted to major general, but Arnold wasn&#39;t. And as I&#39;m going to
explain in a moment, the reason why he didn&#39;t get a promotion has more to do
with things like regionalism and fear of centralized authority than it actually
does have anything to do with Arnold specifically. </p>
<p>So basically, many of
the more radical members of the Continental Congress at this time were afraid
that if everyone was promoted in the Continental Army just according to
seniority of rank that the army would get detached from the legislature and
then it would be seniority and not Congress that would be determining promotions,
so Congress might end up being powerless over the army. And so the result that
they feared would be maybe a military dictatorship, an aristocracy based on
high military rank--that somehow or other, if the army had control of promotion
everything was going to spin out of control and Congress would have no power. </p>
<p>So, afraid of this, Congress
debated and ultimately decided that officers should be appointed not just
according to seniority, but almost more important, on the basis of balancing
out the numbers of officers from different states. Okay. So they figure we&#39;re
going to have regional balance. We&#39;re going to maintain control of the
promotion process and maintain regional balance in the numbers of officers. So
essentially in the interest of preserving a national confederation of some kind,
regional balance in the military was given priority. </p>
<p>As Washington--George
Washington explained to Arnold when Arnold was denied his promotion, &quot;as
Connecticut had already two major-generals, it was their full share.&quot;
Okay. That&#39;s got to be really sour grapes, like &#39;What? [laughs] Connecticut
doesn&#39;t deserve any more major generals so I don&#39;t get a promotion?&#39; &quot;I
confess this is a strange mode of reasoning; but it may serve to show you, that
the promotion, that was due to your seniority, was not overlooked for want of
merit in you.&quot; So he&#39;s trying to make Arnold feel better. &#39;Well, you
actually--I know you deserved it but I&#39;m sorry. You really can&#39;t have it, because
Connecticut doesn&#39;t get any more for a while.&#39; </p>
<p>Okay. Arnold did not
get his promotion, did not get it for want of merit. This did not make him
happy. Washington&#39;s trying to explain that there are larger principles at play,
principles that show how fearful people were of centralized power in any form,
and in this case they&#39;re afraid of some kind of powerful standing army, and
they&#39;re using regional balance as a priority to sort of balance out fears of
centralized power wherever they&#39;re afraid it&#39;s going to crop up. </p>
<p>As one congressman
wrote at the time, Arnold&#39;s promotion was blocked because it raised, quote,
&quot;a question of monarchical or republican principles at a most crucial
time.&quot; So you could see even this one guy&#39;s promotion is being tied into
these much larger fears and ideas. Congress felt compelled to establish its
promotion policy based on fears of an independent standing army that might take
power for itself. They&#39;re trying to keep control of military promotion--so here
you see fear of a standing army, fear of centralized power and regionalism all
stirred up and all at play in full force. </p>
<p>Now luckily for
Arnold at this point, there was a military action in Connecticut. Arnold proved
himself militarily--yet again he ends up getting promoted to major general--but
now his rank is beneath those who had been his equals before. Right? They had
been promoted ahead of him so they still have seniority over him. Arnold really
wants equal rank, equal seniority with the men he had formerly been equal to.
He also felt that Congress owed him money because he had been using his
personal funds to supply his troops, and obviously he&#39;s already living well
beyond his means, so this question of whether or not he&#39;s actually owed money
by Congress and whether or not Congress is actually going to pay him back--for
him, that&#39;s a serious question. </p>
<p>The more that Arnold
demanded that he be promoted to the level of his former equals, the stronger Congress
dug in its heels and refused to comply, so that the whole idea clearly is becoming
now a matter of principle in which the honor and authority of the Continental
Congress is at stake now in addition to whatever larger issues are at play. And
this might sound a little familiar if you think back to some of the logic
deployed by the British Parliament as problems were growing out of questions of
taxation. In addition to all of the larger problems and concerns mixed up in
that question, part of what was at play was that Parliament ultimately, at some
point down the road of that controversy, didn&#39;t want to lose face by seeming to
surrender the issue to its colonies. </p>
<p>So the honor of Parliament
is involved in that issue, here the honor of the Continental Congress. They
feel like that&#39;s at issue and they can&#39;t just back down because Arnold is being
really persistent about what he wants. As South Carolina Congressman Henry
Laurens put it at the time, his colleagues&#39; behavior in Congress was, quote,
&quot;disgusting.&quot; Arnold was refused &quot;not because he was deficient
in merit or that his demand was not well founded but because he asked for it &amp;
that granting at such insistence would be derogatory to the honour of Congress.&quot;
Now that&#39;s Laurens&#39; point of view. </p>
<p>Another congressman
with different politics and another point of view came up with a whole different
way of looking at this whole controversy--drew very different conclusions--and
said that denying Arnold his promotion was a triumph of republican principles.
Military rank would stay in control of the legislature; the army wouldn&#39;t
become independent and aristocratic. So you can see even again something that
is seemingly not that important, which is the promotion of one guy, stirs up
all of these larger issues for all kinds of people in different ways. People
aren&#39;t even united about what it means. </p>
<p>Now it was at roughly
this moment--when Arnold is frustrated--he wants promotion--he doesn&#39;t see a
way to get it--he keeps getting turned down--he feels like he&#39;s owed money in
some way--he just feels basically stymied in every way--his reputation now he
also feels is being attacked simply because he&#39;s asking for promotion--this is
roughly the time when he met Peggy Shippen, who was the daughter of a wealthy
merchant in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>Now the Shippens,
along with any number of Philadelphia&#39;s other sort of best families, mingled
freely with British officers when the British were in occupation of
Philadelphia--when the British were not there, mingled freely with American
officers. When the British had possession of Philadelphia apparently there were
elaborate dances and great sorts of theatrical productions. It was a grand
social scene when the British were there. When the British were not there,
Americans also had entertainments. They weren&#39;t quite as extravagant, but still
enough to encourage the participation of all of the best families of
Philadelphia. Peggy Shippen was certainly in the midst of all of this
socializing, enjoying whatever socializing was going on with whatever group,
and apparently she was very popular. She was sort of the literal belle of the
ball, one of the more attractive and noteworthy young women in Philadelphia&#39;s
social scene at that time. </p>
<p>Now this suggests a
few things about Peggy Shippen, one or two of which are significant for our
story here. For one obvious thing, it suggests that she certainly was dressed
at the height of fashion, that she was skilled at flirtation, that she was
aggressive in social circles, but what that adds up to as far as our story is
concerned, is that she was displaying ambition on one of the few stages where
women could display open ambition, and that&#39;s social events, social functions,
in a sense the private world. But certainly on the social stage, that&#39;s a place
where women could successfully display and exercise ambition, and it certainly
suggests that Peggy Shippen was perfectly comfortable doing that on the social
scene of Philadelphia. </p>
<p>So Peggy married
Benedict Arnold in April of 1779. He already was someone who was spending
extravagantly. This just encouraged him to increase his spending, because now
he had a wife to spend on, in addition to whatever he was spending on himself. And
it was shortly after his marriage, when he still remained frustrated in his
military hopes, his expenses are rising and rising all the time, this is the
moment where he began to ponder the possibility of aiding the British. And
apparently in his mind he justified his actions by assuming the British were
inevitably going to win anyway, that the British--that the likelihood that the
colonies were going to be victorious against the empire, in his mind, is
unlikely. So given that the British are inevitably going to win, his helping
them win the war is going to end bloodshed as quickly as possible, so he&#39;s
doing a good thing by somehow helping the British. Now clearly that&#39;s a sort of
self-serving way of looking at it. He has other motives too, but that was part
of his logic. </p>
<p>So in May of 1779, he
and Peggy decided to ask a local man in Philadelphia who they knew had Loyalist
sympathies and who was a poet to act as a go-between with the British so they
could at least open a conversation with them. And this man, whose name was
Joseph Stansbury, later described Arnold&#39;s invitation. He described what Arnold
said to him at this moment: </p>
<p>&quot;General Arnold
sent for me and, after some general conversation, opened his political
sentiments respecting the war carrying on between Great Britain and America,
declaring his abhorrence of a separation of the latter from the former as a
measure that would be ruinous to both. General Arnold then communicated to me,
under a solemn obligation of secrecy, his intention of offering his services to
the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in any way that would most
effectually restore the former government and destroy the [then] usurped
authority of Congress, either by immediately joining the British Army or
cooperating on some concerted plan with Sir Henry Clinton&quot;--</p>
<p>(who is the British
commander in chief). Yeah. That&#39;s quite some conversation there. </p>
<p>Now the person who
ultimately ended up facilitating communication between Arnold and Sir Henry
Clinton was a young British officer named Major John André, who was a sort of
favorite of Henry Clinton, was sort of his right-hand man. Apparently, Peggy
Shippen knew him. They had met when the British had been in Philadelphia, and
in fact they&#39;d been a little bit flirtatious when the British were in
Philadelphia, so they knew each other. </p>
<p>To most people who
knew André--and as we&#39;re going to see later on in this story, particularly to
Americans--André was the very ideal of a gentleman. He was charming. He was
well educated. He wrote poetry. He wrote plays. He was flirtatious. He drew
portraits to amuse the ladies and his fellow officers. He&#39;s supposedly very
good-looking. So basically in a sense, André is sort of this gentlemanly ideal,
and then he&#39;s also this gallant soldier, so you add it all up and it&#39;s just a
package of sort of &quot;ideal gentleman.&quot; </p>
<p>Like Arnold, André
had used the army as a way to better his station, although his station was
already somewhat elevated. So André&#39;s father was a wealthy merchant. André
thought that trade was a little bit disreputable so he decided that the army
was a better way for him to advance himself, exercise his ambition, and achieve
fame and glory, again not that unlike Arnold. </p>
<p>So André ends up
being at the center of Arnold&#39;s plans with the British, and basically the plan
was the Arnolds would send messages to the British, but they would be written
by Peggy Arnold and then sent to André through Joseph Stansbury who would pick up
the letters and deliver them, crossing back and forth between American and
British lines, and then André could go on and speak to Henry Clinton himself. </p>
<p>Now Stansbury, hoping
to make things a little less risky for himself, got another poet that he knew
behind British lines to carry the messages from his hand to André&#39;s hand. So
Benedict Arnold&#39;s negotiations with the British would be written out by Peggy;
she&#39;d give her letters to Stansbury; Stansbury would give them to another poet;
the poet would give them to André; André would take them to Clinton. </p>
<p>Okay. That&#39;s a long
chain of people, but what&#39;s really interesting about that chain of people is
that when you think of the pieces and the assumptions underlying the pieces, it
revealed a lot about society and some of its assumptions at the time. It was
actually André who suggested that the letters should at least seem to be
written by Peggy Arnold and addressed to André, because André knew that
something written by a woman would never be assumed to have anything to do with
politics or war. </p>
<p>A letter from a woman
is going to assume to be private and personal. Women were basically a nonentity
in public life, they didn&#39;t exist as public figures, so, as André explained in
a note to the Arnolds, &quot;The Lady [meaning Peggy] might write to me. . .
This will come by a flag of truce, every messenger remaining ignorant of what
they are charged with.&quot; These will seem like private letters. They can
kind of write in code. It&#39;ll come from a woman. No one will know what they are,
and under a flag of truce, messengers will help deliver these messages and no
one will know what they are, because they&#39;re written by a woman. So their
letters to each other could seem to talk about things like parties and dances
and what André termed &quot;other nonsense.&quot; Right? They can pretend to be
talking about whatever they&#39;re talking about but they&#39;re going to actually send
coded messages. And these letters would be passed through both the American and
British lines because they would supposedly have nothing to do with the war,
because they were from or to a woman. Okay. So part of this whole plan of
espionage is built around the simple fact that women were invisible in public
life, so they were very useful agents of espionage. </p>
<p>It&#39;s also interesting
to note that both the Arnolds&#39; chosen messenger, Stansbury, and Stanbury--Stansbury&#39;s
chosen messenger to André, both of them were poets, and in a sense poets were
also people who would not necessarily be assumed to be centrally involved with
fighting a war. It could have been quite natural for American and British men
of letters to chat, to meet, to correspond. Cultural bonds--for example an
interest in the art of poetry--could easily cross political boundaries, and
André himself was a poet of sorts, so that too showed something interesting
about society at the time: this assumption that common cultural bonds between
American and British men of letters and literature could be assumed to be above
politics and war, above national bonds enough that it might help them pass back
and forth between American and British lines. </p>
<p>Okay. So using this
whole string of people, this string of poets, Arnold and the British negotiated
for a time and then stopped because the British would not promise to give
Arnold the huge sum of money that he demanded for his services. A year later in
1780, negotiations began again, this time focused on a specific demand by the
British. The British specifically asked Arnold for his help in getting control
of West Point, and Arnold felt that he could probably get command of West Point
and then find a way to deliver it to the British. </p>
<p>And in exchange for
this mission Arnold wanted 30,000 pounds sterling, which is a vast sum of money
at this time. I think--sterling to dollar I can&#39;t translate, but just to give
you a sense--I believe that when the government gets under way, George
Washington is making a salary of $25,000 a year and that&#39;s a big blob of money.
I think Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury were making $5,000 a year
maybe. So 30,000 pounds sterling is a lot of money. Plus, he wanted payment of
all of his debts. So he&#39;s not being modest. But General Clinton--communicating
through André--refused to commit any money to Arnold until Arnold had actually
accomplished something. Right? He doesn&#39;t at this point even have command of
West Point. </p>
<p>So at this point with
their plan almost foiled, things go perhaps one step worse when George
Washington asks to see Arnold and tries to reward him. Right? He still feels
bad. The guy didn&#39;t get the promotion he wanted. Washington says he&#39;s going to
try to reward him by giving him a better command than West Point. Right? West
Point&#39;s not really in the center of the fighting. Washington basically says, &#39;You
don&#39;t really want West Point. I&#39;ll give you something better than West Point,&#39;
and, as Washington later recorded, Arnold had a strange reaction to this offer.
Quote: &quot;Upon this information his countenance changed and he appeared to
be quite fallen; and, instead of thanking me, or expressing any pleasure at the
appointment, [he] never opened his mouth&quot;--okay, because he--Arnold&#39;s like,
&#39;uh oh, [laughs] this is not what I expected.&#39; Right? </p>
<p>Peggy Arnold when
informed in Philadelphia that Arnold had been promised a better command than
West Point apparently burst into hysterics and then after regaining herself
said she was sobbing because of the danger that this put her husband in. Okay.
She&#39;s really sobbing because their plan is about to be foiled, but her
explanation again sort of took advantage of stereotypes about women, in this
case capitalizing on the assumption that women were not involved in such things
as military commands; they would just be worried about their husbands&#39; welfare.
So that&#39;s the excuse she comes up with, and we&#39;re going to see her deploy this
really successfully in just a few minutes at the sort of penultimate moment of
crisis in this whole controversy. </p>
<p>Ultimately, that
offer of another command for Arnold fell through and he was given command of
West Point. And through that whole chain of letter exchanges it was quickly
established that Arnold and André and Clinton were now ready to actually do
business. But now at this crucial point someone had to speak with Arnold in
person to make final arrangements. And here we get yet another example of how
important it was for young men to gain status in the army--and actually young
men of all kinds to gain status in the army--and how useful the army could be
for promoting your own status and reputation, even for people who already had some
social status--because in this case André&#39;s commander in chief and friend,
General Clinton, said the mission was too dangerous for his favorite right-hand
man. Right? He says to André, &#39;This is not for you. This is too dangerous,&#39; but
André actually insisted on being the communicator between Clinton and Arnold
because he really desperately wanted a chance to earn a promotion and he really
thought that this moment of potential glory could be it, could be his big
chance. </p>
<p>So André and Arnold
met; they talked. Throughout his trip to meet with Arnold and during the visit,
André claimed to be a merchant named John Anderson--right?--and he wore this
sort of cloak, but it&#39;s important to note that underneath his cloak he had on
his British uniform. And this was important because if he was captured in his
official uniform, he would be a prisoner of war and thus protected, even
possibly traded back to the British in exchange for a high-ranking American
prisoner, but if he was in plain clothes he would be a lowly spy, and a spy had
only one fate waiting for him and that was death by hanging. So he&#39;s cloaked
but he does have on his British uniform. </p>
<p>Okay. Complications
naturally arose when a friend of Arnold&#39;s saw André with the cloak off. Right?
So the friend of Arnold says, &#39;Wow. You&#39;re chatting with a British officer. [laughter]
What does that mean?&#39; Okay. So forced to come up with some kind of an
explanation--you could imagine that moment; that&#39;s a big sort of &quot;uh oh, [laughs]
I&#39;m chatting with a British officer&quot;--Arnold said that André was a
merchant who had put on a British uniform to sneak through British lines. Right?
Quick thinking on Arnold&#39;s part, but Arnold&#39;s friend said: &#39;Oh, okay. Well,
given that&#39;--he says to Andre´--&#39;You&#39;d be much safer now just to dress in plain
clothes, because now that you&#39;re past British lines you shouldn&#39;t be wearing a
British uniform.&#39; Okay. There&#39;s not a lot that André can say to that logic so
he puts on plain clothes. </p>
<p>He&#39;s carrying papers
from Arnold about their plot and shoves them into his boot, and André then set
off to head back to General Clinton, had just about made his way back to
British-claimed territory when he was stopped by three men who questioned him,
searched his clothing, and eventually found the papers in his boot. And the
three men brought André to American authorities. Now, even now André thought
that maybe he could claim to be a secret agent in Arnold&#39;s service. Right? He&#39;s--Actually,
he&#39;s wearing plain clothes and he has papers from Arnold, so he&#39;s thinking: &#39;well,
there&#39;s not actually anything to link me with the British at this moment. I
could just be a lowly spy doing something for Arnold so maybe I&#39;m still okay.&#39; </p>
<p>However, the officer
who he was taken to became suspicious when André was given clean clothes, and
the ribbon that he removed from his hair was dusted with powder. Okay, the
sneaky powder. What that meant was that he clearly was a gentleman who powdered
his hair. He was not a lowly spy. So whoever this observant person was, he saw
the ribbon, he saw that it was dusted with powder, and he thought: &#39;I don&#39;t
think you&#39;re some pseudo lowly spy person. I think you must be someone more
important. Something fishy is going on here.&#39; </p>
<p>So now, this American
officer sent the captured papers on to George Washington. Washington, as luck
would have it, was on his way to West Point to meet with Benedict Arnold. [laughter]
Right? Talk about your sort of lucky strike. Right? So he&#39;s riding off, heading
to West Point to meet with Arnold as a friend, see how West Point is going, and
now this letter from André is winging its way to Arnold&#39;s headquarters at West
Point. </p>
<p>When it became
obvious that he was now being really held suspect, André confessed who he was,
and he did so at this early point so that he could reveal that he wasn&#39;t a
lowly spy but actually was a gentleman and an officer who had been caught. And
to him this really made a difference. As he explained to Washington, he wasn&#39;t
revealing his true identity for his own safety and security. As he put it, he
wasn&#39;t trying to &quot;rescue himself from an imputation of having assumed a
mean character for treacherous purposes or self-interest&quot;--so he says, &#39;I&#39;m
not revealing this because I&#39;m hoping to plead for my life.&#39; Rather, he was
revealing his true identity, quote, &quot;to vindicate my fame&quot; from any
suspicion that he was a lowly spy. So basically he&#39;s revealing who he is because
he wants to be recognized as an officer and a gentleman. </p>
<p>And that letter--also
sent on to the headquarters at West Point to wait for Washington when he
arrives at West Point. Boy, Washington&#39;s going to have fun when he arrives at
West Point. Washington has not yet gotten to Arnold&#39;s house. He sent two of his
aides ahead to prepare for his arrival. They were actually eating breakfast
with Benedict Arnold when letters began to arrive at headquarters. Realizing
that something bad was unfolding as one after another sort of dispatch came in
with these frantic letters that had to get to Washington, Arnold ran upstairs.
Washington--Washington&#39;s aides later said he looked oddly agitated. He told
Peggy that they&#39;d been caught. He ran downstairs. He told Washington that--and
his aides actually, not Washington. He&#39;s not there yet--he told Washington&#39;s
aides that he had to go prepare for a reception for Washington, and fled on
horseback. &quot;Poof,&quot; he&#39;s gone. And eventually he was taken aboard a
British ship in the harbor. </p>
<p>Washington arrived
shortly after this moment, reads all of these letters and messages that are
waiting for him, and at this moment Peggy, who now knows that things are really
exploding and she&#39;s in big trouble, erupts into hysterics, entirely flustering
all of the men present--because she&#39;s at this point surrounded by men--right?--her
husband&#39;s aides, George Washington, George Washington&#39;s aides. She erupts into
hysterics and one of Arnold&#39;s aides said, &quot;I heard a shriek to me and
sprang from my bed, ran upstairs, and there met the miserable lady, raving,
distracted . . . with her hair disheveled and flowing about her neck. Her
morning gown, with few other clothes, [laughter] remained on her, too few to be
seen by a gentleman of the family, much less by many strangers.&quot; Okay, the
semi-nude Peggy Arnold. &quot;She seized me by the hand with this, to me
distressing, address, and a wild look, &#39;Colonel . . . have you ordered my child
to be killed?&#39;&quot; Okay. Peggy raving, &#39;You&#39;re going to kill my baby.&#39; </p>
<p>She raved apparently
for several days. Generally speaking, she could have sincerely been distressed.
Right? Her husband just ran off, things are in trouble, Washington&#39;s there, the
jig is up, people know about the plot. Her seeming insanity, raving about a
murdered baby, maybe not so sincere, and Washington&#39;s aides were entirely
sucked in to her distress. As Alexander Hamilton put it, and he was really sucked
right in there, &quot;one moment she raved; another she melted into tears. . .
in a manner that would have pierced insensibility itself. . . . It was the most
affecting scene I ever was witness to&quot; [laughter]--that&#39;s on the part of Hamilton.
</p>
<p>Okay. So here again
is Peggy using prevailing assumptions about women to her advantage. She&#39;s
raving. She&#39;s hysterical. She&#39;s talking about her baby. She&#39;s not wearing very
much clothing, [laughter] apparently. There were many reasons for the men who
were present not to suspect that she&#39;s actually involved in the treasonous
plot. So Arnold is fleeing to a British ship, André is an American prisoner,
and Peggy is being doted on by half a dozen American officers. [laughter] By
prolonging her hysteria, she was playing on what she knew would be their sense
of gallantry to help her, and their emotional response to a distraught woman
who&#39;s sobbing and semi-nude. So eventually she went home to her family in
Philadelphia. </p>
<p>André&#39;s fate was
still up for grabs. He assumed that a gentleman and officer of his rank would
never be accused of being a lowly spy and he would be exchanged for an
equivalent American officer. But this was not to be. But interestingly, while
he was in captivity, André became much more than a British spy to the American
officers who were holding him prisoner, because during his captivity Washington
and his aides spent a lot of time with him and came to consider him as the very
model of what a gentleman and an officer should be. All of Washington&#39;s aides
literally wanted to be André. Some of them actually said that in writing: &#39;I
wish I were André. [laughter] He&#39;s so gallant. He&#39;s so brave. He&#39;s so--&#39; Yeah.
</p>
<p>So André really is
this ideal. He&#39;s handsome. He&#39;s aristocratically genteel. He&#39;s stoic in the
face of imminent death. He&#39;s willingly sacrificing his life for his country,
even if that country is England and not America. Even Washington was taken with
André and called him a gallant and accomplished officer. Despite such respect
for André, his request to be shot as an officer and a gentleman rather than
hanged as a spy was denied. Washington couldn&#39;t grant that request without
raising doubts about André&#39;s guilt as a spy. </p>
<p>So October 1, 1780,
was named as the day of André&#39;s execution. On that day André dressed with
extreme care. He went out of his way to show his calm fortitude and his
gentility and his dignity in the face of death. He was a true British officer
to the last, because apparently as he walked to the scaffold he said, quote,
&quot;I am very much surprised to find your troops under such good
discipline.&quot; [laughter] Can you imagine? &#39;I&#39;m about to die. My, you
Americans are quite disciplined, aren&#39;t you?&#39; [laughter] Thank you, John André.
&quot;And your music is excellent,&quot; he added. [laughter] Thank you very
much. </p>
<p>He was supposedly
taken aback for a moment when he saw the gallows, because up until that moment
he really had been expecting a firing squad. He asked if he had to die in this
manner. Told he would, he replied in a loud voice, which was remembered later
by lots of people in their diaries and in letters, &quot;I am reconciled to my
fate but not to the mode.&quot; Right? So the audience was like: &#39;oh, this is
moving.&#39; [laughter] </p>
<p>When asked if he had
last words he said, &quot;I have nothing more to say, gentleman&quot;--boy, you
better practice last words in this age--&quot;I have nothing more to say,
gentleman, but this: you all bear me witness that I meet my fate as a brave
man.&quot; At this, the crowd began to sob, [laughter] and then the trapdoor
was released and that was the end of Major John André. </p>
<p>Now his death
inspired engravings, songs, poems, plays for years afterward. To many Americans,
he remained a sort of ideal gentleman and officer, this noble and sensitive
youth, this sort of romantic hero. He was beloved by young American officers
who thought he was this superior, genteel, sophisticated, cultured individual
in a way that they didn&#39;t necessarily consider themselves to be. He somehow
seemed better than them, and to many this was inextricably tied up with the fact
that he was a British gentleman, the best of that breed. </p>
<p>The extreme adoration
of André in America shows how Americans still suffered from a little bit of an
inferiority complex in relation to the British who still represented--at least
partly in their mind--the height of culture and sophistication. Even now, in a
time of war, they&#39;re responding to André in this way. </p>
<p>Peggy eventually
joined her husband in England, successfully playing her cards as a woman
throughout to protect herself from the hatred that certainly was shown to her
husband. And Arnold of all of them was really cursed forever, eternally hated
largely of course because of his treason, his betrayal of the American cause,
but partly in a sense also because in some ways his actions were understandable
to some people in America. He was someone who was ambitious and tried to raise
his status. He was someone who spent too much money, took too many risks to
advance himself. He was someone who was seduced by all that the British had to
offer. In a sense, he was a kind of everyman gone wrong, an example of the
worst that was possible in this new somewhat more egalitarian American world. So
part of the reason why Americans hated Arnold with such passion is that partly
they understood that in some ways, Arnold was them. </p>
<p>Wow. That was just in
time. Okay. That is the end of today&#39;s lecture. We move on in the coming weeks
to war, to Washington, to sort of looking at how things are playing out on the
battlefield, and then we will work our way towards Articles of Confederation
and an actual Constitution by the end of the semester. We will make it there.
See you on Thursday. </p>
