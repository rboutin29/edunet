<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>Now,
I&#39;m looking out at all of these faces and I&#39;m assuming that many of you have
probably arrived here with some preconceived notions about the American
Revolution. I&#39;m assuming that at least some of you are sitting there and in the
back of your mind you&#39;re thinking--Declaration of Independence, a bunch of
battles, George Washington, a little bit of Paul Revere thrown in--and all of
those things are going to appear in the course but obviously the real American
Revolution is a lot more complex than that. It&#39;s more than a string of names
and documents and battles, and as a matter of fact in many ways the American
Revolution wasn&#39;t just a war. If you went back to the mid-eighteenth century,
went back to the period of the Revolution or maybe just after it, and you asked
people how they understood what was happening, many of them would tell you that
the war was actually only a minor part of the American Revolution. Some would
tell you the war actually wasn&#39;t the American Revolution at all and you&#39;ll see
the--I should mention that the syllabus is finally up online so it&#39;s there for
you, but you will see when you look at the syllabus that at the very start of
it there are two quotes and I want to read them here because they make this
point really well. </p>
<p>So the first quote is
from a letter by John Adams and he&#39;s writing to Thomas Jefferson in 1815 and
he&#39;s heard about an attempt to write the history of the American Revolution so
this is what Adams has to say about that. &quot;As to the history of the Revolution,
my ideas may be peculiar, perhaps singular, but what do we mean by the Revolution?
The war? That was no part of the Revolution.&quot; There is the moment where
you go &quot;Huh?&quot; &quot;It was only an effect and consequence of it. The
Revolution was in the minds of the people, and this was effected from 1760 to
1775, in the course of fifteen years before a drop of blood was drawn at
Lexington.&quot; </p>
<p>Okay. So there we
have John Adams saying that the war was actually no part of the Revolution.
It&#39;s a pretty famous quote but it&#39;s a pretty interesting statement. Now I want
to mention here, and it&#39;s very early in the course for me to have worked you in
to liking John Adams and I&#39;m going to talk more about John Adams in a few
minutes, but I will mention here since I&#39;ve just read that quote if partway
through the semester you decide you&#39;re just dying to read dead people&#39;s mail,
which is basically what historians do for a living, a great volume to read is
actually the letters that Jefferson and Adams sent back and forth to each other
over the course of their lives. They&#39;ve all been pulled together into one
volume and the best part of that volume is the end section, the letters in
which these guys were writing to each other in their old age. So you have these
two Founder figures, former presidents, and they&#39;re just basically letting it
rip in these letters. They&#39;re talking about everything. They&#39;re talking about
all the things actually you probably wouldn&#39;t talk about normally: religion,
politics, who they hate, who they like, what they thought of the Revolution,
what they thought of their own presidency, what they thought of the other guy&#39;s
presidency, the top ten Founder funerals. Actually, there&#39;s a little section,
although I think it&#39;s the top three Founder funerals, but it&#39;s a weird, really
interesting range of stuff and it&#39;s just these two people really excited about
the fact that they&#39;ve retired and all they need to do now is write to each
other and really get to know each other better. So it&#39;s a great volume. It&#39;s
edited by Lester Cappon. The last name is C-a-p-p-o-n if you&#39;re interested. </p>
<p>Okay. So that quote I
just read you is actually from that series of letters, Adams saying that the
war was no part of the Revolution. Adams does say, &quot;Well, maybe my ideas
are a little bit peculiar&quot; but he&#39;s not the only one spouting that kind of
thought. So here is Benjamin Rush, who I guess in a way you could say was
doctor to the stars. He was actually this renowned doctor from the
revolutionary and early national period and he had a lot of high-placed
political friends. So here&#39;s Benjamin Rush writing in 1787: &quot;There is
nothing more common than to confound the terms of the American Revolution with
those of the late American war. The American war is over but this is far from
being the case with the American Revolution. On the contrary, nothing but the
first act of this great drama is closed.&quot; So there you have Benjamin Rush
saying that boy, this is a common problem. A lot of people mix up American
Revolution with American war and they&#39;re not just one and the same thing. The
war is over. The Revolution goes on, and Rush is saying this even as late as
1787. It&#39;s four years after the treaty that ended the war, we&#39;re heading in to
Constitution territory, and to Rush, the Revolution is continuing. </p>
<p>So what do these
people mean? Well, in part, they are expressing part of what this class is
going to be exploring. They&#39;re basically suggesting that the American
Revolution represented an enormous change of mindset as loyal British colonists--right?--long-standing
loyal British colonists, were transformed gradually into angry revolutionaries
and ultimately into Americans. Like John Adams suggests, the beginnings of this
transformation predate the actual fighting, and like Benjamin Rush suggests, it
doesn&#39;t just come to a close when you sign a peace treaty. So when you look at
things from this broad view, the Revolution actually becomes the beginning of a
period in which the American nation was really inventing itself, and this is a
really dramatic kind of invention. You have--In a sense we&#39;re just little
pipsqueaks at this point, and so you have these little pipsqueaks and they are
actually saying, &quot;Okay. We reject monarchy. We&#39;re going to turn towards a
democratic republic.&quot; They&#39;re saying, &quot;Yeah. Well, we know the
power&#39;s been at the imperial center forever. We&#39;re going to turn our backs on
that and pull power in to what&#39;s basically the margins of the British
empire.&quot; They&#39;re turning away from an assumption that the few are in
power and they&#39;re saying, &quot;Well, what if we try putting the many in
power?&quot; </p>
<p>Those are pretty
dramatic changes and they aren&#39;t of course the only changes. People--Colonists
began to think about themselves differently. It&#39;s really easy to underestimate
the degree to which individual colonies at that time were really like little
independent nation-state colonies. They were not united in any sense of the
term. There wasn&#39;t any tradition of colonies being able to communicate between
each other. It was actually in some ways easier to communicate with the mother
country than to get some kind of news up and down the Atlantic seaboard.
Colonists often knew more about the mother country than they knew about people
from other colonies. They--When you look at correspondence from this period,
people often refer--Northerners will refer to Southerners as though they&#39;re
people from a strange, alien country who have weird accents. It&#39;s hard to know
what they are saying; they dress so strangely. It&#39;s amazing to think about the
differences, the degree to which colonies really stood alone in this time
period. And this idea, that there really is pretty much no reason to assume
that these colonies would have been able to join together, that&#39;s pretty much
going to be in the first two or three lectures of the course. What we talk
about is we try and get a sense of who these colonists are, and how they&#39;re
ending up moving their way into a revolution. So this scattered group of independent
colonists gradually came together to form one united nation, not the goal but
the outcome. </p>
<p>Given everything that
I just said, you can see why this idea that there might be a united nation is
actually a pretty big surprise. You can see why a lot of people assumed that it
could never work. You can actually also assume why a lot of people might not
even have liked it as an idea, and you can even see why after the Constitution
goes into effect and the government is getting under way, even then people were
really just not sure this thing was going to work. They really--They referred
to it as an experiment, which is really how they viewed it. And it&#39;s amazing when
you look at letters from the 1790s you&#39;ll see these little throwaway comments
like &quot;If this government lasts more than five years, here&#39;s what I think
we should do.&quot; Okay, there--It&#39;s a completely weird mindset and it&#39;s not
something that we would assume is there, but this is pretty much a high-stakes
experiment. </p>
<p>So this class is
going to explore this big shift in mindset, and the war will be at the center
of this shift, and it&#39;s going to do this from a participant&#39;s point of view.
It&#39;s going to really grapple with how things made sense at the time to the
people who were there. And I&#39;m going to go more in to that in a minute or two.
</p>
<p>I want to talk for
just a second about how the course is organized and just for a minute or two
about some of the readings for the course. The course is partly chronological
and partly thematic so we do proceed along, we follow the narrative of events
of how things evolved, all those nasty acts, people protesting, have a war, try
to figure out what to do after the war. We do follow that sort of trajectory,
but we&#39;re also going to once in a while step back and look at the big picture,
so that we&#39;re not just following events; we&#39;re going to be always putting
events in context. </p>
<p>And the readings for
the course go in that same direction. We&#39;re going to read Gordon Wood&#39;s <i>Radicalism
of the American Revolution, </i>which is a really great overview of this time
period and also presents an argument, obviously as you could tell from the
title, that the Revolution was really radical. Some people agree with that and
some disagree, and actually one of the discussion sections is geared around
discussing that very idea, and by the end of the course you&#39;ll probably have
some pretty strong ideas not necessarily agreeing with mine but, based on what
you&#39;ve read and what I&#39;ve said and what you&#39;ve thought, you&#39;ll probably have
some strong ideas about how radical was the American Revolution. </p>
<p>We&#39;re going to be
reading Robert Gross&#39;s <i>The Minutemen and Their World, </i>which you can hear
is right along the lines of what I was just saying. It really gives you a sense
of what it was like at the time for people who ended up doing things like
fighting at Lexington and Concord. </p>
<p>We&#39;re going to read
Bernard Bailyn&#39;s <i>Faces of Revolution, </i>which includes an array of
chapters on different people who played a major role in the Revolution as well
as chapters on the ideals and the ideology or basically the logic of American
independence, and Bailyn is really well known as sort of--He wrote this amazing
book on the ideology of the American Revolution, and what you&#39;re going to be
reading; he basically took a big, meaty chunk from that book, the part that
everybody really focuses on, and put it in this book, <i>Faces of Revolution, </i>so
we will be reading that as well as part of the readings for the course. </p>
<p>We&#39;re also going to
be reading Ray Raphael&#39;s <i>A People&#39;s History of the American Revolution, </i>which
does just what the title would suggest. It does--It looks at how different
kinds of people, Native Americans, average rebels, African Americans,
Loyalists, women, how all of these different people of different types experienced
the Revolution. </p>
<p>And then in addition
to reading historical scholarship, we&#39;re going to be reading some of the
literature of the period. We&#39;re going to be reading Thomas Paine&#39;s <i>Common
Sense, </i>which I love. How many of you have read <i>Common Sense </i>before?
A good number of you, not--yeah, some of you. I love <i>Common Sense. </i>I
think it&#39;s an amazing piece of writing, and I think when you read it for this
course you&#39;ll get a sense of why it had such a huge influence at the time. </p>
<p>We&#39;re going to read
some essays from <i>The Federalist </i>written by Alexander Hamilton and James
Madison and John Jay, but we are not going to read them as--You may have read
them before. You may have encountered <i>The Federalist </i>essays as the grand
source of authority on the Constitution. Right? How could it not be that when
you have Founder-type guys talking about the Constitution and they were the
guys who were at the convention? Well, the fact of the matter is <i>The
Federalist </i>essays weren&#39;t intended to be an objective document. They&#39;re actually
really subjective, and we&#39;re going to look at them in this course as what they
were written to be, which is a really big commercial advertisement for this new
experimental Constitution. They were actually trying to sell people on an idea,
and because of that, as we&#39;ll see when we read that for this course, there are
things in there that maybe are a little bit exaggerated and things in there
that maybe aren&#39;t talked about in great detail and one or two things that
probably aren&#39;t really true but it was in a good cause. Right? These guys are
saying, &quot;I really think this Constitution is the way to go. Let me say
something that&#39;s going to really calm you so that we can go ahead with this
experiment.&quot; </p>
<p>And of course we&#39;re
going to be reading the Declaration of Independence. We&#39;re going to be reading
the Constitution. We&#39;re going to be reading a lot of documents and letters and
other kinds of assorted items to really give us a sense of the period, and at
one point I&#39;m even going to bring in a newspaper from the period so that we can
actually look at it and get a sense of how people are getting news of the war
at that moment. A lot of these documents we&#39;re going to pull from a book called
<i>Major Problems in the Era of the American Revolution, </i>and it&#39;s a nice
collection of primary documents and essays about sort of related themes. It
always makes me laugh when I say that title because it&#39;s part of a series of
books and the books are <i>Major Problems in the Revolution, Major Problems in
the Early National Period, Major Problems in the Civil War,</i> so basically
all of American history appears to be a major problem, [laughter] which--It
kind of gives me pause, but despite that, it&#39;s a nice collection of things and
we&#39;ll be using that for the class. </p>
<p>So that gives you a
sense of how the course is going to flow and what these readings are going to
do, which brings me to the portion of the lecture that I&#39;m going to call
Freeman&#39;s Top Five Tips for Studying the American Revolution, and I want to
explain before I launch into them what the heck I mean. Basically, when I was
preparing this lecture and thinking to myself what do I want you to know about
right at the outset before we even start talking about the Revolution itself.
And I ended up with a list of things that as I talk about them here may seem
obvious, but the more I talk about them I think the less obvious they&#39;ll
appear, and they&#39;re actually really important to consider in a course that
deals with something like America&#39;s founding. There&#39;s a lot wrapped up in that.
Just that phrase. Just think about the phrase--right?--the &#39;Founding Fathers,&#39;
the &#39;Founding Period.&#39; You just can see the capital letters. [laughs] You
don&#39;t even need to see it in writing. In your mind it&#39;s always capitalized. We
assume a lot of things about this time period, and it&#39;s sort of an iconic
period when you think about American history. </p>
<p>To us, a lot of the
people and events of this time period and the documents of this time period are
kind of what America is all about, which is understandable, but to think about
the founding period as historians, we need to think differently. We need to be
aware of all of those assumptions, all of that cultural baggage that we bring
when we&#39;re looking at something like the American Revolution, we need to be
aware of them, and then we need to get past them so that we can really begin to
understand the people and events of the Revolution for what they were. And
that&#39;s how I got to Freeman&#39;s Top Five Tips for Studying the American
Revolution; five things that you should bear in mind when studying this period,
five things obviously that will be useful to remember throughout the course,
basically all of them aimed at just shaking the assumptions right out of us. And
the first tip is actually really related to that point. </p>
<p>The first tip is: Avoid
the dreaded Revolutionary War fact bubble. And what I mean by that is you&#39;re
going to be sitting here and over the course of the semester you&#39;re going to
hear a lot of familiar names and events, Boston Tea Party, George Washington,
the greatest hits of the Revolution, the things you know and love and learned
in high school. They&#39;re all going to be here and hearing all of these beloved
greatest hits you may be tempted to sort of sit back in your seat and drift
along with the happy, familiar events. Aaah, the story of the American
Revolution; I love the story of the American Revolution. Well, I love the story
of the American Revolution but there&#39;s a different story of the American
Revolution besides all these names, facts, and dates that you probably have
arrived here with in your head. It&#39;s a really good dramatic story but it&#39;s not
a string of facts, so thus the fact bubble. It&#39;s not a fact bubble. The Revolution
obviously is a lot more than that and you need to sort of almost be aware of
the fact and then allow yourself to step back and look at the big picture. And
John Adams and Benjamin Rush and others like them would have been the first to
tell you the facts in a sense are the least of it. </p>
<p>So that&#39;s--Tip number
one is don&#39;t get lost in the dreaded Revolutionary War fact bubble, which I
have to say it makes me think of the first time that I taught this course. I
was actually a brand new professor and I had just come to Yale and it was my
first course and it was my first lecture in my first course and I&#39;m [sound cuts
out] It actually was in Connecticut Hall, which, for those of you who don&#39;t
know, dates back to the period when this course is talking about and was Nathan
Hale&#39;s--essentially his dorm. So there I am. I&#39;m a brand new professor to Yale
and I&#39;m teaching a course about the Revolution and it&#39;s in a building that
dates to the Revolution, so I&#39;m having sort of a &quot;wow&quot; Yale moment as
it is, and I&#39;m off, I&#39;m giving my lectures, and I&#39;m really excited. I give
about three of them and someone raises their hand after about three lectures
and they have kind of a puzzled expression on their face. I said,
&quot;Yes?&quot; And he says, &quot;Excuse me, Professor Freeman. What are we
supposed to be memorizing? Where are the facts and dates?&quot; [laughs] So
as a new professor my first impulse was: Darn! I forgot the facts and dates. [laughter]
I got it wrong. [laughs] But actually, the fact of the matter is, they&#39;re not
the star of the show. Certainly, dates are not the star of the show. There are
dates you&#39;re going to have to remember so don&#39;t think Easy Street; there&#39;s not
a date I have to know. There will be some dates, but this isn&#39;t a story about
dates. It&#39;s obviously something a lot more interesting and a lot broader than
that. Okay. Avoid fact bubble. </p>
<p>Tip number two:
Think about the meaning of words. Now on the one hand, this may seem really
obvious and you may be sitting here thinking oh, great, this is going to be a
semester of Freeman saying: &quot;What does revolution mean? What does war
mean?&quot;, which would be a really, really, really long semester, and that&#39;s
actually maybe--There might even be a point where I&#39;ll say, &quot;What does
revolution mean?&quot; I even kind of, sort of said it already, but that&#39;s not
what I mean when I say think about the meaning of words. What I really mean
here is be careful what you assume about words because what seems obvious in
meaning to you now probably meant something really different in 1776 or 1787,
and I want to look at one example because it&#39;s a really striking one and that&#39;s
the word &quot;democracy.&quot; Okay. So sitting here in this room, by our
standards, democracy is a good thing. Right? Democracy is a good thing. Every
once in a while as a professor you say something and then you think with horror
about how it&#39;s going to look in your notes. So you&#39;ll have all these notes, and
then it will say &quot;democracy is a good thing,&quot; [laughs]--a really sophisticated
class we&#39;re teaching here at Yale. But to us it&#39;s good, and to people in the
founding generation, not so much. They weren&#39;t so sure about it. To them the
word &quot;democracy&quot; signaled a kind of government in which every single person
participated personally, not a government based on representation. We&#39;re
talking mass politics, in the minds of most people in the founding generation
just the definition of what chaos was. </p>
<p>So just listen to a
sentence in one of the last letters written by Alexander Hamilton, 1804, the
night before his duel with Aaron Burr. So he&#39;s sort of speaking to posterity in
case he should die and this is what he writes in this letter. &quot;I will here
express but one sentiment, which is that the dismemberment of our empire&quot;--I
love the fact that America&#39;s an empire in 1804--&quot;will be a clear sacrifice
of great positive advantages without any counterbalancing good, administering
no relief to our real disease, which is democracy.&quot; Okay. Our real
disease is democracy, Alexander Hamilton. </p>
<p>Now admittedly,
Hamilton might not be the shining example of the point I&#39;m trying to make here
because he&#39;s not exactly Mr. Democracy so you wouldn&#39;t really expect him to be
clapping his hands for it. But now listen to Thomas Jefferson, who maybe you
would brand Mr. Democracy. So Jefferson in 1816 is chatting away with someone
in a letter about what America&#39;s trying to do and whether America&#39;s actually
achieving it, and he says, &#39;Actually, democracy is pretty impractical.&#39; He can
imagine it in a town but outside of one town it just won&#39;t work; again, really
clear. Their sense of what that word means is really different from our sense
of what that word means. Now Jefferson immediately goes on to add that
democratical--a democratical but representative government is a good thing. Right?
A democracy, not so much, but democratical, which is a great--In the eighteenth
century they were always adding &quot;ical&quot; on to the end of things, which
could end perfectly happily with a &quot;c.&quot; [laughs] This is a great
eighteenth-century-sounding word, &quot;democratical.&quot; A democratical
representative government is a good thing, but democracy not. </p>
<p>So the moral of this
story is don&#39;t fall in to what I call &#39;democraspeak.&#39; Don&#39;t write papers where
you toss around terms like &quot;democracy,&quot; &quot;liberty,&quot;
&quot;freedom,&quot; without really thinking about what you mean and what they
meant. As Americans we&#39;re used to tossing those words around, but to early
Americans, if you think about it, to early American slave holders, words like
&quot;liberty,&quot; other such words, have a much more complicated meaning. </p>
<p>So tip number two:
Think about the meaning of words. Which brings us to tip number three:
Remember that Founders were people. Now as I was writing this I thought oh,
that&#39;s another one of those things I don&#39;t want to see in people&#39;s notes: [laughs]
Democracy is good, Founders are people. [laughs] Such a highfalutin&#39; course
I&#39;m teaching here. Again it sounds really obvious, but what I really mean here
is we tend to forget this pretty simple fact. </p>
<p>We forget that the Founders
were people. We assume that they were these all-knowing demigods who were sort
of calmly walking their way through the creation of a new model nation. We kind
of deify them. We put them up on this sort of -- aah--founder mountaintop of
American history, and it&#39;s--really it&#39;s easy to do. Sometimes just listening to
their words or reading their words would inspire you to want to do that. Here
is a random phrase. I thought what could I write here that would be sort of
inspiring Founder talk and this was the one--two sentences that I came up with
just because they always stick in my mind because they sound kind of amazing.
This is actually Thomas Paine, <i>Common Sense. </i>In the middle of it he
writes, &quot;We have it in our power to begin the world over again. The
birthday of a new world is at hand.&quot; </p>
<p>Okay. That&#39;s really--That&#39;s
inspiring stuff. That&#39;s fine writing, but that&#39;s inspiring talk and it&#39;s supposed
to be obviously because Paine&#39;s trying to convince people that independence is
a really good idea, but these kinds of words, this sort of glorious rhetoric,
shouldn&#39;t block out the simple fact that the Founders were people. They were
regular human beings. They were well educated, they were thoughtful, they were
sometimes well-meaning, they were sometimes hard-working, maybe sometimes not
so much, they were people aiming high, they were people who did feel responsible
to posterity, but still they were people. </p>
<p>And to me this is one
of the really exciting things about history generally and about this time
period specifically. We&#39;re talking about people trying to figure things out.
We&#39;re talking about the most basic things about America--right?--its existence,
[laughs] that it is a nation, that it has a constitution, and we&#39;re looking at
people trying to figure out how all that stuff is going to be created and how
it&#39;s going to work. These are people who are scared. These are people who make
dumb mistakes on occasion. They&#39;re figuring it out as they go. </p>
<p>The history of this
period is a history of decisions of various kinds, and these were hard
decisions and they were being made by people who did not know the answers.
They&#39;re making it up as they go along. I think that&#39;s just fascinating when you
just read their correspondence and get a sense of how much they&#39;re really in
the dark. There&#39;s--Actually, when you read letters from the period, a lot of
them say the same thing right when the government launches. I think George
Washington and James Madison and a Pennsylvania senator almost say the exact
same thing. It&#39;s almost like they went in to a room and said, &quot;So how will we
express being scared at this moment? Aah, here&#39;s a good sentence.&quot; They
all say basically, &quot;I feel like I&#39;m walking on hollow ground. I feel like
the ground&#39;s going to break beneath my feet.&quot; They&#39;ve just launched this Constitution
and they all are sort of standing there on the national stage thinking, what if
this all explodes? Do we actually know what we&#39;re doing? That&#39;s a really
fascinating part of this period to me. </p>
<p>Now of course
sometimes people did try to figure out the answers in a wonderful sort of Enlightenment
way, and my favorite example of this is James Madison who prepared himself
ultimately for the Constitutional Convention by studying all governments across
all time. [laughs] Can you imagine? Well, I&#39;d better go study all of
government ever [laughter] to get ready for this convention, but he does. It&#39;s
a great sort of Enlightenment thing to do. He&#39;s thinking I will now discover
the eternal pattern of politics and he&#39;s thinking if I can do that then I can
reach for the best, I can avoid the worst, and whatever we&#39;re going to do when
we make a new government maybe we&#39;re going to actually do something better than
what&#39;s come before. So there&#39;s a logic to it; as ambitious as it is there&#39;s a
logic. And he was serious about it so it wasn&#39;t even just I wonder what happens
if I read a lot about government. He actually was serious about it. He even
made a kind of a little chart in which he listed the governments and then
listed pros and cons. You know, like what did I think of Sparta? He&#39;s sort of
[laughter] amazing, across all time, so I love the fact that he did that Founder-like
thing to do, but there you see a person, a really intellectually ambitious
person, trying to figure things out like how do we know what to make? [laughs]
What&#39;s this constitution supposed to look like? How are we going to figure
that out? Okay. I&#39;ll just study all of government and let you know. </p>
<p>So when we talk about
the American Revolution we&#39;re talking about people and this course takes this
idea really seriously. Part of what we&#39;re going to be doing over the course of
the semester is looking at the Revolution from the vantage point of
participants, trying to see how people at the time understood the events
unfolding around them. How did the colonists understand themselves as British
subjects? How did they feel about the British empire or about the King or
about Parliament? How did they come to put American-ness in the foreground?
How did rebelling against their own country make sense? </p>
<p>And that&#39;s something
I think we also tend to forget about the Revolution. We think of it as our war;
it&#39;s us against them and them equals the British, but of course we were the
British. So it&#39;s something that you don&#39;t think about but people at the time, certainly
in the 1790s, people referred to this as &quot;the Civil War&quot; because
that&#39;s what it was. It&#39;s just not the way we happen to think about it because
in our mind we&#39;ve already traveled down the road and we&#39;re already &quot;us&quot;
but in their mind it was in a sense brother against brother; it was us against
us. So we&#39;re going to try to keep that sort of thing in mind as we explore how
the events of this time made sense at that time. And I will say here we are not
going to forget about the British so we&#39;re not going to have a patriot-centric
course. The British have a logic to what they&#39;re doing, whether they&#39;re making
policy or whether they&#39;re fighting battles, and we will definitely look at the
logic of what the British are doing as well as what the colonists are doing. </p>
<p>Now I will admit
right here up front that I will be offering you a sampling of really arrogant
British quotes about crude colonists, and I&#39;m doing that partly because there&#39;s
just so many good, really arrogant quotes about [laughs] American colonists
that I can&#39;t resist sprinkling them through my lectures and I can&#39;t resist that
so much that I have two here that I just randomly added in because I have a
reason to and so I will. But it&#39;s just--it gives you a sense of how at least
some of the British were thinking and looking at really these little upstarts
on the margins of empire. So random arrogant British quote number one, and this
is from a customs official: &quot;American colonists are a most rude,
depraved, degenerate race, and it is a mortification to us that they speak
English and can trace themselves from that stock.&quot; [laughter] Wow. [laughter]
Just--Even English is a problem. That&#39;s a statement. </p>
<p>Okay. Arrogant quote
number two, and this one I picked just because it&#39;s about George Washington,
and it&#39;s hard to imagine people saying something arrogant about George
Washington who seems to be Mr. Symbol of Authority, but here&#39;s another British
official who met with George Washington and then wrote back home about what he
thought. And he says, &quot;Somehow, and I can&#39;t imagine how, he&#39;s learned the
basics of how to behave in a court society.&quot; It&#39;s like, &#39;ooh.&#39; [laughter]
That must have been a really fun interview, too, if that&#39;s the attitude this
guy had. So there&#39;ll be a sprinkling of that because at dramatic moments in the
war there&#39;s always someone who steps forward and offers that point of view. </p>
<p>That said, we are
going to do justice to the British side of the dispute, to the logic behind the
policy that they were making, because it&#39;s not as though they make a bunch of
dumb policies that make absolutely no sense and we&#39;re righteously outraged and
then there&#39;s a war. Their policies made sense to them. They didn&#39;t happen to
always make sense to the colonists but they made sense to them, and the same
thing goes with British battle plans which, looking back in the long view of
time when we start talking about them, might seem a little goofy but there&#39;s
actually a lot of logic for what they were trying to do when they were
attacking the colonies. </p>
<p>Oh, and I will also
mention -- I guess I probably don&#39;t have time to talk about it now. When I was
preparing this lecture, casting around, trying to figure out what will I put in
the lecture, I don&#39;t know how I came across it but I discovered the Battle of
New Haven. Did anyone know about the Battle of New Haven? Because I did not
know. And I know there&#39;s hostilities around--and I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s Yale
lore that of course you&#39;re all sitting there saying, &quot;Well, of course we
all know about the Battle of New Haven,&quot; [laughter] but I--[laughter] I&#39;m
the only one who doesn&#39;t know about the Battle of New Haven, but it&#39;s --actually
it&#39;s a good story. I&#39;m not going to tell it now. I&#39;m going to leave you in
suspense. It will appear when we start getting in to the fighting of the Revolution,
but let me just give you the sneak preview, which is it does involve the
president [correction: a professor] of Yale College with a gun in his hand
running to fight the British, so it&#39;s [laughter] a Yale moment that we have, so
I will talk about the Battle of New Haven. </p>
<p>Okay. So we aren&#39;t
going to be looking at a story of good guys versus bad guys. We will be
reconstructing opposing points of view, trying to figure out how those points
of view made sense and then obviously we&#39;ll be able to step back and say,
&quot;What happens when you put those two opposing points of view in contact
with each other?&quot; </p>
<p>So tip three:
Founders are people. Which brings us to tip four: We&#39;re not just talking
about Founders. The Revolution was not just a quiet conversation between a
bunch of guys wearing wigs and knee britches. Right? We sort of have this image
that the Revolution is guys in short pants with wigs in a room doing this. [poses]
No. [laughter] That&#39;s the entire founding I think in our minds sort of. I&#39;ll
say that right. So that&#39;s not the Revolution. Right? That&#39;s not what happened.
We&#39;re talking about a revolution, a popular uprising by vast numbers of
colonists fought on American ground by Americans of all kinds, and it meant
different things to different kinds of people. This is not to say that the Founders
aren&#39;t important, far from it, and as you will gather very quickly in this
course I love these guys. Right? I love talking about these guys, I love
writing about these guys, so I&#39;m certainly not saying, &quot;Who cares about Founders?&quot;
</p>
<p>But what I am saying is
that they&#39;re not the only ones who mattered. They didn&#39;t have their own
revolution while everybody else watched. We&#39;re talking about a popular
revolution grounded on the ideas and actions of people throughout many
different levels of society. Now somewhat conversely this brings us to John
Adams. As I promised at the beginning, John Adams is coming and here&#39;s John
Adams. You&#39;ll be hearing from him more than once this semester and actually you
already heard from him once so I can promise that that&#39;s true. This isn&#39;t
because I think that John Adams is the most important figure from the period.
It&#39;s not because I think that he&#39;s always right. In fact, the reason I quote
him a lot is he&#39;s a brilliant, blunt, really direct commentator with--and this
is all-important; you almost need a drum roll here--he has a sense of humor.
John Adams has a sense of humor. It&#39;s not every day that you find a Founder
with a sense of humor. [laughs] I can vouch. There aren&#39;t a lot of chuckling Founders.
Certainly on paper there&#39;s not a lot of chuckling going on among the Founders.
Probably in person there was, but on paper not a lot of them commit humor to
paper and John Adams does. He&#39;s even self-deprecating sometimes, which--Nobody
wants to be self-deprecating on paper when they know that they&#39;re going to be a
Founder, but John Adams sometimes is, and I&#39;m going to offer one little, tiny
dumb example, the first thing that popped in to my mind when I thought, &#39;well,
what am I going to say to show John Adams&#39; sense of humor?&#39; </p>
<p>So this is actually
from that same series of letters in their old age when they&#39;re writing back and
forth to each other. So Adams is writing to Jefferson and he signs his letter
with this: &quot;John Adams in the eighty-ninth year of his age, too fat to
last much longer,&quot; [laughter] which is not typical Founder talk. [laughs]
George Washington is not signing his letters that way but Adams commits that
sort of stuff to paper. What that means is not only is he blunt, direct, and
intelligent but he also even gets to be humorous as well. So in Adams we have
this sort of cantankerous, sometimes bemused, more often irritated,
occasionally self-aware, sometimes really not, stubborn, book-steeped,
event-experiencing, action-taking tour guide. He&#39;s not going to be there all
the time. There are going to be long stretches of the course where we don&#39;t
find John Adams but he&#39;s definitely going to make repeat appearances, and in
the middle of the course he&#39;ll even get to tell a really good story which he
actually basically wrote down and said, &quot;Let me tell you this
story.&quot; So that&#39;s--As a historian, what&#39;s better than historical
characters doing exactly what you want them to do? &#39;Here&#39;s a cool story on the
Revolution. You can quote it in your lecture courses.&#39; [laughter] </p>
<p>Oh, and this actually
makes me think of another John Adams-related thing before I get to tip number
five, which I will get to. Partly I&#39;m curious about this and partly I want to
mention something. How many of you saw the HBO mini-series on John Adams?
Okay, a goodly number of you. I mention that for a specific reason. Now I will
say I of course watched it and the period when it was airing was a really
interesting period for me because as an eighteenth-century historian this may
be the only time I&#39;ve ever been culturally relevant to popular culture. [laughter]
I was like: it&#39;s my moment. Right? People are coming up to me and saying,
&quot;I&#39;ve got a question about John Adams.&quot; Wow. [laughter] This is
great. So it was an interesting moment when people actually were thinking about
John Adams, and I will say also I watched it with a few historians and we were
prepared to throw popcorn at the screen and we ended up pretty much liking it
and we were surprised. About halfway through we all looked at each other and said,
&quot;It&#39;s actually pretty good.&quot; So I don&#39;t--I mean, of course there are
always things that any kind of TV or movie production about history gets wrong,
so I won&#39;t say that there&#39;s nothing wrong in it. </p>
<p>However, there is one
thing that is wrong and I&#39;m going to mention it because if you have pictures in
your mind from the mini-series as you sit here in this course it could be a bad
thing to think that they are accurate, and what I&#39;m talking about is actually
the--I think it&#39;s the first episode. It is of course the first episode, and
that&#39;s the episode where the Revolution is beginning and you see people milling
about sort of with fists. Right? That represents the Revolution. You see the
beginning of the Revolution. The bizarre thing about the way that they depict
it is apparently according to the producers of this mini-series, if there was
something happening in the early stages of the Revolution, John Adams
apparently was there. Boy, they&#39;re shooting at Lexington and Concord. Adams
races across the countryside [laughter] to get to Lexington and Concord. Boston
Massacre--John Adams staring at the-- [laughter] Well, the idea is really that
John Adams somehow is never off his horse, riding around Massachusetts trying
to be an eyewitness to every [laughter] historical event. Now I understand that
probably the people who made this thought: how the heck are we going to
communicate Boston Massacre, Lexington and Concord? This is a film about Adams
and we can&#39;t say, &quot;Put Adams over here while we now turn to random people
on a field shooting.&quot; [laughter] So I understand narrative-wise why they
needed to do this, but Adams was not at every historical event [laughs] in the
Revolutionary War. He was at many and he definitely had an insider&#39;s view of
the Boston Massacre, but he was not everywhere in Massachusetts. </p>
<p>Okay. That oddly
enough brings me to tip number five in the Freeman Guide, and tip number five
is: remember contingency. Again, an obvious thing but something we don&#39;t think
about. People at the time didn&#39;t know what was going to happen, so Adams could
not race to places where he didn&#39;t know the things that happened yet: &quot;Something
might be happening at Lexington.&quot; People didn&#39;t know what was going to
happen. </p>
<p>Think for a moment
about all of the things that we assume about the Revolution. We assume that the
colonists were right and that the British were wrong. We assume that a Revolution
was inevitable. We assume that there was broad agreement at any one time about
what should be done. Right? Of course we need to declare independence. Of
course the colonists are going to win the war. Of course there should be a
national union. Those are all the sorts of things that I think we do assume and
that&#39;s a lot of assumptions; that&#39;s a lot of &quot;of courses,&quot; but in
fact it&#39;s important to remember that people didn&#39;t know what was going to
happen. </p>
<p>You really need to
allow for contingency because literally what they assumed was: anything can
happen. Anything can happen. Again one of the things that I love about this
time period is that the emotions are so heightened. If you&#39;re in an atmosphere
where everything&#39;s up in the air and you&#39;re in the middle of a revolution or
you&#39;re trying to create a government and you literally don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming
next and anything can happen, &#39;maybe I&#39;ll get hanged by the king, maybe I&#39;ll
get shot going home, maybe America will hate the Constitution so much they will
throw rocks at my head.&#39; I mean, I don&#39;t know what they were thinking -- &#39;maybe
the Constitution will last four days and then collapse.&#39; Whatever they&#39;re
thinking, the fact is because they literally think anything can happen,
anything could fall apart at any second, the emotions are really raised and
it&#39;s why a lot of the rhetoric in this period is so extreme. It&#39;s not that
these guys are trying to be dramatic. They actually are dramatic; they&#39;re
feeling that this is a dramatic kind of a moment, and I don&#39;t think you get
that sense, I don&#39;t think you get that idea unless you remind yourself about
contingency, about the fact that there are no predetermined outcomes and that
anything can happen. I think particularly when you&#39;re studying a revolution
it&#39;s really important to remember contingency, and we will discover what
contingency means in this time period over the course of the semester. And I
will end there. I will see many of you perhaps on Thursday. I will probably
know next week better about the reality of when we&#39;ll be meeting for discussion
sections.</p>
