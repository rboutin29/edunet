<p><b>Professor Joanne
Freeman: </b>So
today we are going to take the plunge [laughs] into the actual outbreak of
warfare. However, now that I&#39;ve teased you that way, I do actually want us to
get to declare independence. [laughs] If you think about it, we didn&#39;t quite
get there yesterday so I do want us to declare independence for just a few
minutes. We&#39;re going to close that off and then we will move on to the opening
of hostilities and the logic behind them and really what they show. </p>
<p>So thinking back to
Tuesday, Tuesday we ended with a discussion of the editing of the completed
draft of the Declaration, and I mentioned that Jefferson&#39;s passage on slavery
was cut out of the final document for any number of reasons, one of them
obviously being that for Southerners, that would have been a deal breaker, and
also because there were all sorts of inherent inconsistencies in what Jefferson
had written. </p>
<p>Now the editing
process went on for a few days only. It wasn&#39;t longer than that. Actually,
events are unfolding pretty quickly here as far as drafting, editing, passing,
and moving on with the Declaration of Independence. And Jefferson did not enjoy
the editing process. Jefferson hated the editing process because he really
thought they were completely mangling his beautiful, wonderful prose. So
supposedly he sat in the corner of the room in the main chamber of the Congress
looking really miserable--okay--just sort of cringing and wincing every time
they cut another one of his beautiful words or substituted some other word in
there. So apparently, and we get this partly from Jefferson himself, he looked
so miserable that Benjamin Franklin ended up going over to him to try to cheer
him up. </p>
<p>And I&#39;m offering this
partly because I&#39;m always trying obviously to get us past the sort of &#39;oh,
American Revolution, the Declaration.&#39; Right? I&#39;m trying to sort of make this
human--right?--human documents, human moments, human struggling, so we&#39;re now
really going to humanize the Declaration of Independence. So Jefferson says--he&#39;s
sitting there. Where are his words here? Okay. He said Franklin, quote,
&quot;perceived that I was not insensible to these mutilations.&quot; Okay.
[laughs] So Franklin saw that--according to Jefferson how much I hated them
mutilating my document, and Franklin ends up telling Jefferson a story, and
then Jefferson, kindly for us looking on, preserved the story, so I can offer
you the story that Franklin told Jefferson basically to distract him while they
were editing the Declaration of Independence. </p>
<p>So Franklin told this
story of a hatter named John Thompson, and this hatter named John Thompson
wanted to open a shop and he wanted to create a sign to hang over the door, and
he planned on having the sign say &quot;John Thompson, Hatter, makes and sells hats
for ready money,&quot; and then there&#39;d be a picture of a hat. So that&#39;s his
plan, but he decides he&#39;ll run the sign by a few of his friends to see what
they think; is that the right sign for him to put up in front of his new shop?
</p>
<p>So he goes to one
friend and the first friend says, &#39;Well, you don&#39;t really need the word
&#39;hatter,&#39; do you? Because obviously if you make and sell hats, you&#39;re a hatter.
So you could just cut the word &#39;hatter.&#39; And the next one says, &#39;Makes? Do
you really have to say &#39;makes hats&#39;? Obviously, they&#39;re hats. You don&#39;t need
the word &#39;makes.&#39; You can cut the word &#39;makes.&#39; It&#39;s unneeded on the sign.&#39;
Another says, &#39;Why say &#39;for ready money&#39;? What? You&#39;re going to give away the
hats? [laughter] You can cut &#39;for ready money.&#39; And so obviously this goes
on and on. Franklin continues to tell this anecdote until in the end the sign
just says John Thompson and has a picture of a hat. [laughter] Okay. So
Franklin tells this story and then he says, &#39;The moral of the story--&#39; He even
had a moral. The moral of the story is that Franklin made it--tried, quote,
&quot;whenever in my power, to avoid becoming the draughtsman of papers to be
reviewed by a public body.&quot; Okay. Never write anything that a public body
will edit because you will be very sad and all of your words will be sliced
away. So that&#39;s this little, tiny human moment happening in the corner of the
chamber where the Continental Congress is meeting. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, they&#39;re
editing the document. On July 2, 1776, Congress votes for independence. Two
days later on July 4, after all of the editing and Jeffersonian cringing,
Congress formally adopted the Declaration of Independence--so we have declared
independence, we&#39;ve adopted the Declaration of Independence, but obviously now
something has to happen to the document, and it wasn&#39;t intended to be something
that was sort of filed away. </p>
<p>It was intended
obviously to have an impact--and there were two audiences in mind. On the one
hand, people in the Congress did think that if they declared their intentions
and what they were doing in some sort of a document, that the outer world,
people beyond the colonies, first of all would understand what was going on and
then hopefully might even want to offer aid. Right? Any--Basically, if they&#39;re
declaring independence against Britain, maybe people who don&#39;t like Britain
will want to help us. So first they&#39;re thinking: possibly a European audience. </p>
<p>But even more
important than that, they&#39;re thinking about a domestic audience. They&#39;re
thinking about having the American people not only understand what&#39;s happening
but really hear this document that they&#39;ve tinkered every word over, the
Congress&#39;s feelings about what they think is happening, what they believe is
going on in the colonies, what they are declaring to the world. </p>
<p>And so what happens
basically is once the document is passed, it&#39;s issued. The Congress sent it out
to any number of places. They sent it out to the Continental Army, many copies,
so that it could be read to people in the army. And the Continental Army comes
Tuesday, so don&#39;t think I forgot the Continental Army, and George Washington
comes Tuesday. They sent it out to state assemblies. They sent it out to
committees of safety. </p>
<p>Basically, they found
any number of avenues to send out this document so that it could be read aloud,
and that was the plan. It wasn&#39;t for people to sort of read this interestingly
in their newspaper, but they actually had public readings of it on courthouse
steps, in public squares, at public meetings, town meetings. It was sort of a
performed document. It was being read so people could hear what independence--how
independence was being declared. </p>
<p>And in response,
there were all kinds of public celebrations and demonstrations--so there were
fireworks, there were parades, and there was a lot of symbolic destruction of
some of the trappings of the Crown. So basically, images of the King--like, on
a tavern sign--were ripped down, were broken into pieces, were burned in
bonfires. In New York City--this--a famous image of this, which you may have
seen--they pulled down a large statue of the King mounted on his horse. They
actually literally pulled it down and then later had it melted into bullets for
the war effort. So clearly--Boy, isn&#39;t that a slap? Yeah, I heard a noise over
there. That&#39;s true. This is &quot;gugsch,&quot; King George. Not only did we
tear you down but we&#39;re going to use you to shoot at you with your own statue. </p>
<p>So obviously
independence is a moment, is an event. It&#39;s not just a document. So--And I
should note here too that now that independence is declared, what had been
colonies are not colonies any longer, right?--if they have declared
independence and they&#39;re saying they are no longer colonies of Great Britain--I&#39;m
going to try to remember from here on out to begin to use the word
&quot;state.&quot; They&#39;re frantically--and I&#39;ll talk more about this on
Tuesday. They&#39;re frantically now also worrying about state constitutions to
replace where the royal government had been in the past, but now obviously
we&#39;re not colonies anymore. We&#39;re moving on to another sort of state of being
and in their mind actually even another word. </p>
<p>But of course there&#39;s
an obvious looming question at hand. Right? Warfare, conflict, hostility:
Something is looming. And there&#39;s no clear path as to how whatever&#39;s going to
happen next is going to unfold or how it should be played out or even just how
these newly-declared states are going to execute warfare. How should they
organize the effort? How should this war be fought? How might it possibly be
won? Right? The idea of winning a war against the power, the might of the
British army--to say the least, that would have been really daunting to these
people. The odds would have felt seemingly impossible, and then on top of that,
what about organizing? Whatever effort you were going to take, what about
organizing? How were you supposed to do that?--particularly given that the
Continental Congress, as we&#39;ll discuss next week, didn&#39;t have any absolute
power to really enforce much of what it did, making it, as we&#39;ll see, even more
difficult for them to sort of organize and carry out a war effort? </p>
<p>So basically, today
and Tuesday I&#39;m going to be talking about the process of opening a war and
organizing a war, basically in the process showing something about the mindset
on both sides. And today particularly you&#39;re going to get a sense, just by
looking on ground level at what&#39;s happening between British soldiers and --I&#39;m
going to still say &quot;colonists&quot; because it&#39;s in my head. We&#39;ll move on
to Americans, but I&#39;m going to--&quot;colonists&quot; is right here. I can&#39;t
banish it yet. I&#39;m feeling very colonial. It&#39;s my habit. It&#39;s my British
tradition. At any rate, today you&#39;re going to get a sense of the real mindset
of the different sides because you&#39;re going to see people interacting, and I
have a number of different sort of eyewitness accounts of different events, so
you can get a sense of the logic behind what people are thinking is going on as
some of these hostilities unfold. </p>
<p>So today we&#39;re going
to be looking at conflict. In the last two lectures, we clearly in one way or
another have been leading up to this moment, so we talked about <i>Common Sense</i>,<i>
</i>talked about the Declaration of Independence, and in discussing both of
those documents I&#39;ve made several references to the surrounding mood. And I
think I&#39;ve used several times that the colonies were &quot;on fire&quot;--and
it was Paine&#39;s, a version of what Paine said, that the colonies seemed to be on
fire in 1775 and that&#39;s what inspires him to want to write. So what we&#39;re going
to do is basically look and see what that means; what is Paine referring to;
what is happening in 1775 that pushed him to feel so compelled to write? </p>
<p>So we&#39;re going to
look at the physical aspect of events unfolding mostly in 1775, a little bit in
1776, the physical reality of the onset of actual hostilities, what the
colonial hostility to the British soldiers stationed in the colonies felt like,
how that was unfolding, what the British soldiers were doing, how they thought
they were going to stem the tide of whatever was happening, </p>
<p>But, as I&#39;ve already
said any number of times in this course, even now when we&#39;re on the cusp of
some kind of physical clash, we&#39;re not looking at two competing groups of
people who see themselves as being entirely distinct and separate peoples. And
we&#39;ve certainly seen on both sides a sort of gradual realization that maybe the
logic of governance is different on both sides, the logic or the understanding
of the empire is different on both sides of the Atlantic, but we don&#39;t have two
peoples here who see themselves as enemy societies. </p>
<p>As Lord Rockingham
put it in Parliament, speaking at the time, he feared that they were looking
at, quote, &quot;the dreadful calamity of shedding British blood by British
hands&quot; [correction: &quot;arms&quot;]. So what we&#39;re talking about here
is civil war. That&#39;s why I titled this lecture Civil War, because that&#39;s what
it was. It was a people divided. There are actually people in--at the time,
certainly I can think of some in the 1790s, who call the Revolution the Civil
War. That&#39;s what it was. That&#39;s what it felt like. That really sort of drives
that home. </p>
<p>Now the first battles
of this war are fought in 1775, but they don&#39;t represent a sort of sudden
plunging into the inevitability of war, and it&#39;s actually quite the opposite.
You&#39;ll see that as these events unfold today. Both sides to some degree really
see themselves as behaving defensively, and ultimately they point the finger at
the other side, but in one way or another, both sides feel that they&#39;re trying
to sort of prevent bad things from happening. </p>
<p>Now on the colonial
side, people assumed that they were collecting arms, that they were creating
local militia units, that they were beginning to stockpile weapons--that this
was all a defensive measure. And at the end of the First Continental Congress,
they actually had declared that maybe the colonies should think about
organizing themselves for defensive measures. So there had been again not a
sort of &quot;attack, attack&quot; measure from the First Continental Congress,
but, &#39;maybe it&#39;s time that we actually should really begin organizing&#39;--but
again this is seen as a defensive measure. </p>
<p>That same kind of
spirit of defensive protection still infuses the Second Continental Congress, and
I mentioned in the last lecture the two things that are happening at the same
time. So the Congress is trying to figure out what to do about a possible war
and sending out the Olive Branch Petition at the same time. Both of those
things are happening at the same time, so they&#39;re not jumping into a war. They
are preparing defensive measures. </p>
<p>On the British side,
the general assumption was that a few strategic moves, a couple of really grand
military maneuvers, maybe one big display of power and the whole thing would
collapse--that there&#39;s no way the colonists could not be dumbstruck and awed by
the force of the British army so, whatever was going to happen, there&#39;d be one
little clash and it would be over. And if they could just seize the weapons and
the ammunition and the things that were being stockpiled, they could sort of
cut things off before it even got any worse. They could just collect the
weapons and take them away and that--the power, the ease with which they would
have marched at this point in to New England and seized arms and weapons--would
show the colonists that this wasn&#39;t worth fighting; it&#39;s not a fight worth
fighting; it&#39;s not a fight that they could fight. So by trying to collect
weapons, trying to collect ammunition, they&#39;re trying to stem--Again it&#39;s
defensive. They&#39;re trying to stop things from getting worse. </p>
<p>Now there were a few
reasons why the British would have assumed one little gesture and it&#39;s over.
Now obviously, the most obvious one is just: the British Army. Okay. We&#39;re talking
about the British Army and a bunch of colonists who just went out and decided
maybe we&#39;d better drill now. Okay. So certainly to the British what they&#39;re
thinking is well, &#39;please, that against us? Okay, we don&#39;t even have to worry
about that.&#39; But more than that, the British also thought, generally speaking,
that the colonists were a lot of bluster and little more, that they just--they
had a lot of hot air there in the colonies but that there actually wasn&#39;t a lot
more to them, certainly not a lot of bravery. And the word &quot;cowards&quot;
is tossed around a lot in letters and in writings and even in speeches in
Parliament from this time period. </p>
<p>So as an example, in
the House of Lords someone apparently stands up and says, &#39;There are a lot of
men in the colonies who could fight against us if they chose to fight. The
colonies abound in men who could serve as soldiers.&#39; So the Earl of Sandwich
stands up and this is his response. &quot;Suppose the colonies do abound in
men, what does that signify? They are raw, undisciplined, cowardly men. I wish
instead of 50 [correction: 40] or 50,000 of these brave fellows, they would
produce in the field at least 200,000, the more the better.&quot; Okay. That&#39;s
a really good arrogant British comment [laughs] in the world of arrogant British
comments. &quot;Believe me, my lords, the very sound of a cannon would carry
them off ... as fast as their feet could carry them. This is too trifling a
part of the argument, to detain your lordships any longer.&quot; Okay. &#39;Please.
We&#39;re not talking about a real threat.&#39; </p>
<p>Nor were the British
very impressed at the idea, this--the whole idea of colonial civilians dressed
up suddenly in military garb and suddenly positioning themselves as soldiers.
So one English visitor to the colonies wrote a letter to a friend in England
and expressed the same feeling. He said, &quot;It is a curious Masquerade Scene
to see grave sober Citizens, Barbers and Tailors who never looked fierce before
in their Lives, but at their Wives, Children, or Apprentices. . . .&quot;
There&#39;s always the little back-handed &quot;gugsch&quot; [laughs] that sort of
goes into these quotes. </p>
<p>So they&#39;ve only
looked fierce before at their wives, children or apprentices, &quot;strutting
about in their Sunday Wigs in stiff Buckles with their Muskets on their
shoulders struggling to put on a Martial countenance. If ever you saw a Goose
assume an Air of Consequence, you may catch some faint idea of the foolish, aukward,
puffed-up Stare of our Tradesmen: the Wig, indeed, is the most frightful Thing
about them, for its very Hairs seem to bristle up in Defiance of the Soldiers.&quot;
</p>
<p>Okay. That&#39;s a
wonderful little passage about exactly what some people thought it looked like
they were doing in the colonies. </p>
<p>General Gage,
commanding the British forces in America, felt similarly, that basically one
big display of force and they could close things off. And you can hear this,
as well as his impatience with this sort of ongoing colonial hostility to the
troops that were positioned in the colonies, in some threats that he made to
some Boston radicals that he met with in 1775. So according to an account, he,
quote, &quot;swore to it by the living God, that if there was a single man of
the King&#39;s troops killed in any of their towns&quot; meaning any of your towns,
your Massachusetts towns, &quot;he would burn it to the ground. What fools you
are ... to pretend to resist the power of Great Britain.&quot; Okay. That to me
is like Darth Vader. [laughter] What fools you are--It&#39;s like wow, [laughs]
that&#39;s a statement of power. How dare you hold yourselves against the empire?
The empire, &quot;She maintained [in the] last war 300,000 men, and will do the
same now rather than suffer the ungrateful people of this country to continue
in their rebellion.&quot; Okay. It&#39;s clear how Gage feels. </p>
<p>So the colonies are
preparing to defend themselves. The British and Gage are assuming a little
display of force will end the matter. Neither side is assuming there&#39;s a
pending war, and you can see both of these views in play at a little event--it&#39;s
not a big moment; it&#39;s actually prior to Lexington and Concord--that plays out
also in Massachusetts in February of 1775. On February 26, Gage decided that he
would have some troops move to Salem, Massachusetts, to seize cannons and guns
that the colonists had collected there. So this is part of that strategy. Well,
let&#39;s just take the weapons away and we&#39;ll march and we&#39;ll look impressive and
they will be nervous and this will be good on all counts. </p>
<p>And I&#39;m going to read
from an account of someone who was there actually who describes what he saw and
what happened: &quot;On Sunday, 26th Feb&#39;y, 1775, my father came home from
church rather sooner than usual which attracted my notice, and said to my
mother &#39;The reg&#39;lars are come and are marching as fast as they can towards the
Northfields bridge;&#39; and looking towards her with a very solemn face remarked
&#39;I don&#39;t know what will be the consequence but something very serious, and I
wish you to keep the children home [correction: &quot;in&quot;].&#39;&quot; Okay.
So you get a sense of, huh? There&#39;s soldiers marching now towards us? What
does this mean? &quot;I looked out of the window just at this time and saw the
troops passing the house,&quot; and apparently they were playing Yankee Doodle
just to be insulting. </p>
<p>&quot;Col. David
Mason had received tidings of the approach of the British troops and ran into
the North Church ... during service ... and cried out, at the top of his voice,
&#39;the reg&#39;lars are coming after the guns.&#39;&quot; At this point several men ran
out to move the guns, and the account continues: &quot;My father looked in
between the platoons ... to see if he could recognize any of the soldiers who
had been stationed at Fort William on the Neck, many of whom were known to
him.&quot; </p>
<p>And that&#39;s always an
interesting little detail to me. These soldiers have been there long enough
that there&#39;s just been mingling of soldiers and people, and so here the troops
are marching and this person&#39;s father is sort of going in to the crowd to see:
If there&#39;s someone here I know, I could ask him what&#39;s happening; where--why
are they coming here; what are their plans. &quot;But he could discover no
familiar faces--was blackguarded by the soldiers for his inquisitiveness, who
asked him, with oaths, what he was looking at [correction: &quot;after&quot;].&quot;
You can actually hear that. &#39;What are you looking at?&#39; Like--&#39;get out of the
way.&#39;</p>
<p>Okay. So at this
point, there&#39;s a group of colonists who see the advancing troops. They go to
this bridge that clearly the British want to get to and march across to get to
the guns, and the colonists pull up a drawbridge so that the soldiers can&#39;t go
any further. And now we get this sort of great and somewhat bizarre standoff.
The British commander is standing on one side and there are colonists on the
other side and the drawbridge is up. And the British commander said that his
troops would fire if the colonists don&#39;t lower the bridge. The local militia
captain says, &#39;Well, if you fire, then you&#39;re all going to be dead men,&#39; and
supposedly the plan of the militia captain was if anyone fired he was going to
run at the head of the British troops and kill him and then throw himself in
the river and drown himself so he wouldn&#39;t get punished for killing a British
soldier, but he was--he had his plan; he was ready to act. [laughter] It&#39;s
like: good plan. </p>
<p>Okay. So at this
point soldiers, civilians--Our eyewitness says it was--that it was a cold day
and he noticed that these soldiers aren&#39;t wearing coats and that actually
they&#39;re beginning to look really miserable and they&#39;re starting to shiver
because they&#39;re just standing there in front of the bridge unable to go
anywhere. And meanwhile some colonists climbed out on the other side of the
bridge and they&#39;re taunting the soldiers. And apparently one particularly loud
person yelled out, &quot;Soldiers, red jackets, lobster coats, cowards, d--na--n
to your government!,&quot; and everybody else shut them up because they really
didn&#39;t want to be fired upon. Right? It&#39;s one thing to just sit there and
mumble. It&#39;s another to say, &quot;Damnation to your government&quot; and taunt
the British into shooting. </p>
<p>At this point the
British commander said that he would get over the bridge if he had to stay
there until autumn. Right? He says, &quot;By God! I will not be defeated,&quot;
to which the colonial captain basically replies and said, &#39;Yeah, well, I think
you already have been defeated because you&#39;re here, and the weapons are there,
and I don&#39;t see you moving.&#39; The British commander insisted that this was the
King&#39;s highway. &quot;Old Mr. James Barr, an Englishman and a man of much
nerve, then replied to him; &#39;it is not the King&#39;s highway, it is a road built
by the owners of the lots on the other side, and no king, country or town has
anything to do with it.&#39;&quot; Okay. King&#39;s highway, my foot. </p>
<p>So now the British
commander is stuck. Right? He doesn&#39;t want to lose face. He&#39;s not going to
surrender to these colonials. He wants to do something. So this to me is the
most amazing part of the story. He actually proposes to the militia captain
that if he and his men are allowed to cross the bridge, he promises that they
will march fifty feet, turn around and march back. Right? [laughter] It&#39;s like:
&#39;I won--[laughs] I got across the bridge.&#39; They&#39;re not going to go after the
weapons. It&#39;s just a symbolic victory, like: they got what they wanted, the
colonials backed down, we&#39;ll just march fifty feet, we&#39;ll turn around and then
march away. </p>
<p>And that&#39;s exactly
what happened. They let them cross, they march, they turn around and they march
away, apparently with the troops marching to the song &quot;The World Turned
Upside Down.&quot; We see--We&#39;re going to see that again in the--when there&#39;s
an actual war. But okay, a little symbolic--&#39;okay, well, maybe I didn&#39;t
entirely lose face&#39; kind of moment by the British. </p>
<p>So there you can see
pretty literally the British assuming that a little marching, a few threats,
everything will fold, they&#39;ll seize weapons, end of matter. That didn&#39;t happen
here. You can see the colonists sort of standing there defensively, not wanting
to cause trouble but also not turning around and running; they&#39;re defending. </p>
<p>Now at roughly this
same point back in England, even as some Members of Parliament were sneering at
the idea of these sort of fighting colonials and as soldiers were trying to
stave off trouble by seizing weapons and ammunitions, others in Parliament were
actually thinking of trying to extend some conciliatory gestures and maybe that
would actually end this before it became a lot worse. And in particular, in the
House of Lords, William Pitt made a number of proposals trying to smooth things
over; all of them were rejected. So he proposes that perhaps they actually
could recognize colonial self-government. Okay. That didn&#39;t go very far.
Surprise! He said, &#39;Okay. Well, what about withdrawing British troops from
Boston?&#39; Rejected. </p>
<p>Instead, in February
1775, New England is declared to be in rebellion, but now we have one last stab
at reconciliation on the part of the British: Lord North. And I&#39;m mentioning
this here because I&#39;ve already talked about the Olive Branch Petition. In a way
this is the equivalent on the other side of the ocean. What we--we&#39;re going to
see here is one attempt to extend one more offer that maybe--maybe--at this
last second will stave things off. People are trying to find a way out of the
problem and really struggling to find some kind of mutual ground. </p>
<p>So, Lord North passes
a resolution. It&#39;s ultimately called the Conciliatory Resolution. And it
proposed that any colony that contributed to the common defense and supported
the civil government and the administration of justice would be relieved of
paying taxes or duties except as needed to regulate commerce--and I&#39;ll repeat
that. The Conciliatory Resolution in February 1775. It proposes that any colony
that contributes to the common defense and supports the civil government and
the administration of justice would be relieved of paying taxes or duties,
except as needed to regulate commerce. </p>
<p>Many in Parliament
were somewhat stunned by this gesture, even though obviously Parliament is not
giving up any of its rights. It&#39;s just making a nice offer, but it&#39;s not saying,
&#39;we don&#39;t have the power to tax, we&#39;re just saying we won&#39;t tax.&#39; But many in
Parliament were stunned. As one observer said, &quot;Uncertainty, surprise,
distraction, were seated on every countenance&quot; when this plan came forth.
To some this seemed to be backing down. To others it seemed beside the point,
that basically what the colonies needed was firmness and these kinds of
concessions weren&#39;t really going to do anything. But the resolution goes
forward; North sends it on to the colonies. He very deliberately did not send
it to the Continental Congress, which he didn&#39;t recognize, but instead he sent
it to individual colonial assemblies, thinking that if some of them, even just
a handful of individual colonial assemblies, agreed to this, then the colonies
would be divided. </p>
<p>And this is an
example of something we&#39;re going to see again and again and again in a variety
of ways in the process of fighting the war. It&#39;s a really common assumption on
the part of the British that all they need to do is just divide the colonies--and
that there are any number of ways in which it will be really easy to just sort
of ruin their loyalties, turn them against each other, and then this whole
thing can be brought to a close. And what we&#39;ll see is what they&#39;re
underestimating. On the one hand, as I&#39;ve already talked about in lectures,
we&#39;ve seen how hard it is for the colonies to do anything jointly, but we&#39;ve
also seen, if there&#39;s an outside threat, they actually come together relatively
effectively for a short period of time. So what the British are underestimating
here is that actually there is some unity; there is a sense of united cause
because of an outside threat. </p>
<p>So North passes the
resolution. Obviously, it did not go far enough at this point for the colonial
leaders. It still maintained the right of Parliament to basically do what it
wanted to do with taxes. But also, in addition to not being enough of a gesture
towards reconciliation, the timing was really poor because it didn&#39;t reach the
colonies until after the outbreak of fighting at Lexington and Concord. </p>
<p>Now given what I
described at Salem, you can see the continued logic of what the British troops
were attempting to do at Lexington and Concord. Basically, they want to seize
powder; they want to seize arms; they want to get the weapons; they&#39;re going to
march; they&#39;re going to have an impressive display, grab the stuff and leave,
and make a big impact. </p>
<p>Americans were very
closely watching the troops by this time. They knew, as soon as the troops set
out, that they were marching even though the troops apparently were trying to
be somewhat secretive about what they were doing--and here we have the famous
Paul Revere moment--and the poor William Dawes, the poor, neglected William
Dawes, like: &#39;me too; he was there too.&#39; He was riding along. Both of them,
Paul Revere and William Dawes, are riding, basically telling people that the
British regulars are on the move; they&#39;re on the march. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the
British are marching towards Lexington on their way to Concord, which is where
the arms are, and they&#39;re beginning to become nervous, because before they get
to towns they can hear the church bells ringing. So basically--&#39;something&#39;s
going on in that town and we haven&#39;t gotten there yet, so somehow or other they
know we&#39;re coming.&#39; One soldier later described how a, quote, &quot;very
genteel man&quot; in a carriage stopped and told them that there were 600 armed
men waiting for them on Lexington Common. Okay. As we&#39;ll see, there were not
600 armed men. There were maybe roughly seventy men who heard the church bell,
knew that was a bad thing, grabbed their weapons, and went to Lexington Common
and are sort of standing there. Okay, not 600. </p>
<p>The British entered
Lexington at about four o&#39;clock in the morning. They saw this group of about
seventy people on Lexington Common, supposedly yelled, &quot;Rebels,
disperse.&quot; Americans later claimed that what they said was, &quot;You
damn rebels, lay down your arms&quot;--so Americans always hear the--if there
is a slur the Americans hear it--at which point a gun was fired, and it&#39;s
unclear who fired the gun. But when that gun was fired, the British opened
fire. There were a few American shots in return. The American commander told
his men, quote, to &quot;take care of themselves,&quot; which means run if you
want, and so they did, leaving behind eight dead--roughly eight dead and ten
wounded. </p>
<p>And now the British
continue on, pushing on to Concord, which is why they came there in the first
place, to get the powder that&#39;s being stored there. And they actually met more
militiamen on the way, and when they marched on them these people actually
fled, which is in a sense what they were really expecting. The British began to
destroy these colonial stores, the ammunition and the weapons. Meanwhile, the
colonists collected near the North Bridge to stop the British and a few British
shots were fired; Americans fired a few shots back before they withdrew. </p>
<p>Again, it&#39;s only a
temporary retreat. So the Americans keep doing something and then fleeing and
then coming back and then fleeing. It&#39;s a temporary retreat on the parts of the
colonists because, as a British officer later reported, as they left Concord
after they&#39;d destroyed these ammunitions, quote, </p>
<p>&quot;We were fired
on from Houses and behind Trees, and before we had gone a half mile we were fired
on from all sides, but mostly from the Rear, where People had hid themselves in
houses till we had passed, and then fired; the Country was an amazing strong
one, full of Hills, Woods, stone Walls. . . which the Rebels did not fail to
take advantage of. . . . In this way we marched between 9 and 10 miles, their
numbers increasing from all parts, while ours was reduced by deaths, wounds,
and fatigue.&quot; </p>
<p>And another officer
later recalled that he heard colonists and actually even saw some of them
standing in the road yelling out, &quot;King Hancock forever.&quot; Okay.
Where that came from I can&#39;t tell you, but they&#39;re out there sort of declaring
their political cause. </p>
<p>This is hardly what
the British expected, and for that matter in a sense the colonists didn&#39;t expect
that sort of event to unfold, but this level of colonial resistance to the
British was a surprise. As another British soldier put it, &quot;The
enthusiastic zeal with which these people have behaved must convince every
reasonable man what a difficult and unpleasant task General Gage has before
him. Even weamin [women] had firelocks.&quot; So the British response on the
one hand is: &#39;oh, okay, they didn&#39;t just melt away; this will be unpleasant for
General Gage.&#39; </p>
<p>All told, roughly 250
British soldiers were killed, roughly ninety-five Americans. For the British
obviously this suggests, that little display of military might not be enough.
For the colonists it revealed the existence of an honest to goodness physical
threat. As John Adams put it, Lexington was proof that, quote, &quot;if we did
not defend ourselves, they would kill us.&quot; Okay. John Adams always just
states it, okay. </p>
<p>Almost immediately
people from both sides began to use the clash as propaganda, basically playing
it up so that they seem defensive and the other side seems as though it&#39;s the
aggressor--so colonists sent riders out to tell people in other towns and other
colonies about how the British had killed every person they came across, women
and children; they had driven pregnant women into the street; [laughter] they
shot dead old men. It&#39;s like: &#39;anything we can think of, they did.&#39; </p>
<p>So obviously they&#39;re
exaggerating a bit what happened in Lexington and Concord, but British accounts
were no less creative. The British accused Americans of scalping dead and dying
British soldiers, claiming, quote, they were &quot;full as bad as the Indians
for Scalping and Cutting the dead men&#39;s Ears and Noses off, and those they get
alive, that are wounded and can&#39;t get off the Ground.&quot; Okay. They&#39;re
scalping live men, those colonists, is what the British are charging. They
claimed that the Americans had fired first; that Americans didn&#39;t fight fair
because they were hiding; that they were cowardly because they were lying on
their bellies hiding instead of standing upright, which is how a traditional
army was supposed to fight--but both sides clearly are positioning themselves
as being defensive at this point. </p>
<p>In June of 1775, the
English got more evidence that the Americans weren&#39;t just going to run. When
colonists attempted to station themselves on Breed&#39;s Hill in Massachusetts
overlooking Boston--not Bunker Hill actually but Breed&#39;s Hill. And the
Americans are thinking: &#39;well, this&#39;ll be very strategic if we go to the top of
this hill, it overlooks Boston, it&#39;s a good place for us to have power or
control over.&#39; The British see that as well, and they attack to prevent the
colonists from taking control of that hill. The conflict is later called the
Battle of Bunker Hill--it should be the Battle of Breed&#39;s Hill--but although the
British ultimately did claim the hill and could claim a victory, it was a
pretty expensive victory. They lost roughly one thousand out of two thousand
men. They had enormous casualties. The Americans lost roughly four hundred men.
</p>
<p>The British really suffered
a lot of losses, and at this point Gage learned a lesson. As he observed after
seeing all of these clashes, the colonists were, quote, &quot;not the
despicable rabble too many have supposed them to be.&quot; &#39;Wow. They&#39;re less
of a despicable rabble than I thought they were.&#39; &quot;These people show a
spirit and conduct against us they never showed against the French&quot;--which
I also think is interesting. What he&#39;s saying is well, we thought we knew these
people from that French and Indian War and they weren&#39;t too impressive then,
but they&#39;re actually behaving differently now. &quot;Everybody has judged of
them from their former appearance and behavior when joined with the King&#39;s
forces in the last war, which has led many into great mistakes. They are now
spirited up by a rage and enthusiasm as great as [ever] people were possessed
of.&quot; </p>
<p>Colonists also
learned a lesson, and you can see this most dramatically in New York State. New
York at the time: There were a number of Conservatives and Loyalists who were
in power in New York. It wasn&#39;t a radical colony. They had actually sent more
conservative delegates to the First Continental Congress. There had even been
talk in New York about not sending delegates to the Second Continental Congress
because &#39;good men&#39; got corrupted when they went to hang out with those scary
radical guys in the Continental Congress. And basically the Crown saw New York
as a good thing, because they were sort of more loyal than many of the other
colonies. That&#39;s New York before the events I&#39;ve talked about today. </p>
<p>After these events
New York made something of a turnaround. They hanged Lord North in effigy; they
seized arms belonging to the city and distributed them to citizens; and
ultimately the British marched out of New York City and retreated to a ship in
the harbor with the colonists grabbing at their baggage and their ammunition as
they left. So that obviously shows that there is an impact. </p>
<p>All over the colonies
people began to feel the need to prepare for war. As one colonist wrote in July
of 1775, &quot;Travel through whatever part of this country you will, you see
the inhabitants training, making firelocks, casting mortars, shells and shot,
and making saltpetre.&quot; Philadelphia was decorated with flags announcing
liberty or death. People are really now motivated with a real--I guess rage and
enthusiasm is a good way of putting it at these recent events. </p>
<p>So now you truly do
get a sense of how the colonies were indeed set on fire in 1775. You can see
what it is that Paine was responding to. You can see why in January of 1776
when <i>Common Sense </i>was published why it had the impact it did, because
people were ready to hear its message. They were willing to at least begin to
consider independence because of what was unfolding in 1775. </p>
<p>Things were at a
difficult point at this point, and if you step back and just look at the larger
logic of what&#39;s going on, you can really see how difficult it would have been
to find your way out of this situation. The British administration couldn&#39;t
really yield to demands of the Continental Congress without sacrificing its
sovereignty over the colonies, and I suppose in their eyes, also humiliating
itself before the eyes of the world. </p>
<p>Along similar lines,
the colonists couldn&#39;t really back down about their demands without seeming to
surrender what they considered to be some of their fundamental rights. They
suspected British attempts at conciliation anyway because they--every time the
British made any sort of gesture that seemed to be moving in the right
direction their thought was: &#39;well, yeah, they&#39;re trying to appease us so we
stop protesting, but they&#39;re just going to be tyrants underneath it all;
they&#39;re basically trying to make us quiet so they can impose tyranny upon us.&#39; </p>
<p>But I do want to
point out--Now I&#39;ve just described all of these dramatic events, men being
killed, battles, people storing arms, a lot of drama, but I&#39;ve talked about
1775 throughout this entire class, right?--and independence isn&#39;t declared
until roughly a year later. Again, which is a really dramatic way of seeing
that war is not inevitable, that people are struggling to avoid it even as
they&#39;re doing all of this and taking all of these actions and acting in the
moment at what&#39;s unfolding. Even after Lexington and Concord in July of 1775,
the Continental Congress still sends out that Olive Branch Petition. </p>
<p>The Americans saw
themselves as Britons as well as Americans. They were defending their rights as
British subjects, and only over time did they really gradually work their way
towards independence. They had first assumed that there was a small group of
corrupt government ministers who maybe were leading things the wrong way, then
they decided well, maybe it was Parliament that was the problem, and only when
the last prop of the British constitution, the monarch, proved deaf to their
cause, did colonists begin to feel that independence might be possible and
ultimately maybe was going to be necessary. </p>
<p>Okay. So where does
this leave us? Well, obviously, it leaves us with a really enormous looming
challenge facing the Continental Congress. Right? Think about: the Continental
Congress doesn&#39;t really have any power, all these delegates in there, and now
&quot;poof,&quot; they somehow have to help organize a united war effort with
no mechanism for doing anything in a united, organized manner. </p>
<p>And I&#39;m going to end
the lecture by letting John Adams sum up this challenge at this point, what it
felt like to be in the Continental Congress at this scary point--and he wrote
this letter in 1775 to his wife actually, to Abigail. And he wrote, &quot;When
50 or 60 Men have a Constitution to form for a great Empire&quot;--I like the
fact that it&#39;s a great empire already--&quot;at the same Time they have a Country
of 1500 Miles extent to fortify, Millions to arm and train, a Naval Power to
begin, an extensive Commerce to regulate, numerous Tribes of Indians to
negotiate with, a standing Army of Twenty seven Thousand Men to raise pay,
victual and officer, I shall really pity those 50 or 60 men.&quot; [laughs] Okay.
So that&#39;s Adams saying, &#39;Boy, I&#39;m not looking forward to this. This is going to
be an enormous task.&#39; </p>
<p>And what we&#39;re going
to be looking at Tuesday is that very thing. How do you hold a war? How do you
begin to organize this kind of effort? What were the things that Congress
immediately did? George Washington is going to appear. That&#39;s one of the things
the Continental Congress does at an early point is find--try to create a
continental army and Washington walked on to the national scene at this point.
So we will look at the unfolding of the war from a different angle next week. I
will stop there. </p>
