<p><b>Professor Keith Wrightson:
</b>Right.
Well, last time I was looking at the vital social distinctions that were
recognized in the sixteenth century and also how people conceived of society as
a whole. So today I want to come down to the other end of the scale and look
at the most fundamental unit of society, the household, the unit in which most
people spent their lives and which governed most of their daily activities. </p>
<p>So let&#39;s begin with
some definitions. The household can be defined in the first instance as being
a unit of residence, of course, but also, as I indicated last time, it was a
unit of authority. It&#39;s a group of people, some related, some unrelated,
living under the same roof under the authority of a household head; usually a
man, sometimes a widowed woman. And in addition the household has been
described as a unit that was &#39;geared for work&#39;, the work which was necessary to
satisfy its needs as a unit of production and of consumption and of
reproduction. So all households have that much in common but they vary greatly
in their size, their composition, and the complexity of the relationships
contained within them. </p>
<p>If we go to the top
of the social scale, the households of the nobility and the gentry could be
very large institutions, indeed sometimes vast institutions. They were
organized to maintain not only a noble family at an expected level of
magnificence--and to be magnificent was one of the qualities of a nobleman in
contemporary thought--but also they were the centers for administering landed
estates; they were the centers for conducting local government; they were the
centers often of the exercise of political power. To give just one example, at
Pontefract Castle in the--more or less in the center of the country in South
Yorkshire, up here--Pontefract Castle was the home of Lord Darcy, and a list of
his household as it was in 1521 survives. There were eighty people in Darcy&#39;s
household--eighty: his family, members of his extended family who lived with
him, his household and estate officers. He had living with him a bunch of
young men who were the sons of his clients amongst the local gentry and
numerous menial servants. When he was called by Henry VIII to go to war
against the Scots in 1523 he took with him twenty-three young men who were
members of his household as his personal guard, wearing his livery. So such
people as Lord Darcy had a style of life to maintain which necessarily
elaborated their domestic establishments and these were the great households of
the age. </p>
<p>Those of lesser
people were of course much smaller and much less elaborate. Usually, basically
they were nuclear family households--husband, wife, and children, rarely
co-resident relatives living with them--and that&#39;s a matter of some
significance. It reflects the common cultural assumption that every newly
married couple should set up its own independent household and indeed that you
should not marry until you could do so; you should not cohabit with your
relatives. Well, in many ways that sounds very modern, but one mustn&#39;t forget
that a large minority of households in this period, although their central core
was a nuclear family, were also much larger than average not because they had
kinsfolk living with them but because they came to include people who were
linked to the household not by blood or birth but by contract; servants,
apprentices. So if sixteenth-century households look familiar in some ways, a
large minority of them were also very different and one could say they differed
from modern households in three essential respects. </p>
<p>They differed structurally
in that a substantial number of them contained people affiliated to the
household by contract, the servants and apprentices. They differed conceptually
in that when people talked about their family in this period they meant not
their immediate blood relatives as we use the term. They meant all members of
their household. Servants and apprentices were regarded as members of their
family; they referred to them as family. So they&#39;re different conceptually. And
they&#39;re also different functionally because these people were usually taken on
for reasons which go beyond the usual functions of a modern household. Whereas
we tend to think of a household as a unit of residence and consumption, child
rearing, and provision of emotional support--all of that was true in the
sixteenth century too--but the household in the sixteenth century also had more
extensive functions which we don&#39;t associate with the household today. They were
units of production. They were farms. They were workshops. They were also
places of education and training where the young were trained in particular
tasks, and that&#39;s what I mean when I say they were geared for work for all this
larger range of functions. </p>
<p>Right. Well, as
working units and as units of residence all households were also spheres of
interdependence. Their maintenance and their survival depended on the
contributions of all their members. As we saw last time, this was in its
ideology a patriarchal society, of course, in the sense that authority was
conventionally located in the persons of adult males in general and adult male
householders in particular, and these assumptions about the structure of
authority were also embodied in law. Remember the law of property I mentioned
last time with regard to women. But despite these constraints of ideology and
law, women&#39;s role in the household was of course indispensable and this was
fully recognized. It was the duty of the householder to maintain his family by
his labor, to exercise his authority in managing its affairs, to play a part in
training servants and apprentices and so forth. The duty of the mistress of
the household was generally summed up in a contemporary word,
&quot;huswifery.&quot; It&#39;s on your sheet. &quot;Huswifery&quot; or
&quot;housewifery.&quot; And that comprised a range of activity very different
from the modern notion of the housewife or the homemaker. </p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t so focused
on the maintenance of the domestic environment. Housing in this period was very
simple. Most people seem to have lived in houses with two or three rooms and
furnishing was exceedingly sparse. When people died inventories of their goods
were drawn up and from them we can learn every single possession that they had,
and it&#39;s striking how sparse domestic interiors were in this period. To give
you one example, a craftsman from Lincolnshire, which is up here, who died in
1540: his inventory survives and he possessed only twenty-two items in all, twenty-two
items, and they were items connected with the three basics of household life: places
to sleep, places to sit, and things to eat with, horn spoons, wooden bowls; twenty-two
items in all, not untypical. So huswifery as they understood it in the
sixteenth century was concerned not so much with managing a domestic
environment as with managing the daily consumption needs of the household. Food
preparation of course was central but also making and mending clothes and
bedding and general provision for the maintenance of the household. </p>
<p>In 1523, a man called
Anthony Fitzherbert wrote a book called <i>The Book of Husbandry </i>and in it
he describes the domestic tasks of a rural woman, and what he describes is a
myriad of activities involving the self-provisioning of a household at this
time: keeping the pigs and the poultry, running the dairy, growing hemp and
flax, spinning it into yarn for making the linen for the family, preparing the
wool clip, laboring in the fields and in the barn when needed, and marketing. Women
seem to have taken care of most of the regular marketing of the produce of the
household: the eggs, the poultry, the pigs, the grain, and of course buying
necessities which couldn&#39;t be produced at home. In the households of urban
craftsmen and tradesmen, things were a little differently organized. Women
were formally excluded from the apprenticeship which would enable them to learn
one of these trades, but very often they learned many aspects of it informally
and the records reveal many glimpses of women active in various aspects of
their husbands&#39; trades, assisting their husbands as bakers and butchers,
carrying water and sand for husbands who were in the building trade, buying raw
materials on their husbands&#39; behalf, selling the finished goods and so forth. How
do we know about things like this? Well, lots of records that survive from
the many courts which governed many aspects of local life give us little
glimpses of what people are doing. We know that women in one city--well, in
Norwich actually--might be down at the water side buying wood for husbands who
were carpenters because on one occasion a fight broke out and what they were
doing happens to be described in the records. You get these kinds of glimpses
of people&#39;s activities. </p>
<p>The wives of laboring
men were less able to participate in the household-based production of a
craftsman&#39;s family because their households were not productive units. They
went out to work for others, but you also find these women engaged in all kinds
of wage labor to make their contribution to the domestic budget. They might do
seasonal agricultural labor. You might find them spinning for wages, producing
the yarn for the cloth industry. They took in sewing and knitting and washing
and all kinds of other activities outside the home. In the city of Chester, up
here in the northwest, for example, at the docks they had a crane which was
operated by a treadmill. Someone had to stand inside a wheel and tread it to
make it turn to make the crane operate. Who was inside the wheel? Women. </p>
<p>You also find many
women engaged in various forms of petty dealing. One glimpse survives of a
woman called Rose, Rose Hearst. She lived in Maldon on the coast of county of
Essex, and we learn that twice a week on market day she went fifteen miles to
the county town to sell oysters. I hope she had a pony. [Laughter]
Carrying a basket of oysters fifteen miles would be no joke. But Rose Hearst
sold oysters twice a week. </p>
<p>So overall women&#39;s
tasks extended well beyond the domestic sphere to include a host of forms of
self-provisioning or supplementary earning according to the circumstances of
different kinds of household. The mix would vary, but the common
characteristic of their gender role was flexibility and adaptability in what
was expected of them. Mary Prior, who&#39;s written an excellent article on
women&#39;s work in this period, sums it up. She says, &quot;what men did was
definite, well defined and limited [to their craft or trade]. What women did
was everything else.&quot; In a way that&#39;s slightly unfair to men. They
worked very hard too, but it&#39;s essentially true. </p>
<p>Well, this constant
round of duties of huswifery were conducted in the context of a further role,
women&#39;s reproductive role, which is worth dwelling on a little. Most couples
in this period got married in their mid- to late- twenties. They married
relatively late when they were ready to set up their own household. Historical
demographers who researched the parish registers, which give us the details of
people&#39;s marriages and the baptisms of their children and so forth, they&#39;ve
revealed that the average woman could expect to have her first child within eighteen
months of marriage, and she could then expect on average to have another child
at intervals of two to three years for the rest of her fertile life, if she
lived that long. Think about it. That means that the average woman in
sixteenth-century England was pregnant for a quarter to a third of her entire
adult life and that they were constantly besieged by the needs of small
children. These births being spaced across an entire adult life meant that
when some children were teenagers and ready to go out into service others were
still toddlers and so forth--constant demands of small children. So it&#39;s not
surprising that, as Thomas Tusser said in the mid sixteenth century, &quot;huswives&#39;
affairs have never none ende&quot;--&quot;huswives&#39; affairs have never none
ende&quot;--and despite their legal subordination it was of course on the
performance of these complex roles--adapted to circumstances--that women&#39;s
standing as individuals depended amongst their neighbors, within their
families, and from the performance of these roles doubtless that they derived
their self-esteem. </p>
<p>Well, in an
agriculturally dominated, labor-intensive, low-productivity, pre-mechanized and
pre-contraceptive age it could hardly be otherwise, and for the same reasons
children were expected to play their part too. Only a small minority of
children would have formal schooling in the sixteenth century--it&#39;s been
estimated perhaps 10% in the early sixteenth century. Most children would
learn their life skills practically at home or as servants and they were
expected to begin that and to participate in the domestic economy as soon as
they were able to do so. That may sound exploitative but one mustn&#39;t
exaggerate. Such participation was an essential part of their education for
life and children tended to be introduced to tasks at an appropriate stage. There&#39;s
also plenty of evidence of them playing, but from the age of about seven or
eight you find them regularly engaged in tasks that they were able to manage:
herding sheep and cows, reaping, gathering fuel, fetching and carrying, picking
fruit, scaring birds in the fields, and so on and so forth. </p>
<p>There&#39;s a remarkable
study by Barbara Hanawalt of Ohio State University of children, children&#39;s
working activities in this period which is based on the records of coroners. When
someone died an untimely death it had to be investigated by the coroner just as
today; they already had that system. And the records of coroners which survive
which deal with the deaths of children reveal what they were doing at the time
that they suffered an accident leading to their death, and so you can look at
this and you have their age and you can see what tasks they were engaged in. So
for example, a little boy is helping his father to cut down a tree when the ax
head strikes him and sadly he&#39;s killed, or a little girl is fetching water when
she falls down a well and so on and so forth. From evidence like this an
imaginative historian can reconstruct the way in which children were gradually
introduced in to their working life. Sustained, repetitive labor of the kind
we associate with exploitative child labor was relatively rare--though it
existed, especially in the areas which were heavily involved in the cloth
trade. That&#39;s where you find children carding wool, spinning wool for long
hours. </p>
<p>So the household in
the sixteenth century was a unit geared for work and its members&#39; roles varied
according to contemporary ideas and values regarding the proper roles of men,
women and children. So let&#39;s turn now to the priorities of households and the
strategies by which they achieved them. </p>
<p>Well, the first
priority obviously enough was survival. That meant maintaining the flow of
resources on which the household depended. Today that would be your salary. In
the sixteenth century it meant various combinations of self-provisioning on one
hand and engaging in markets on the other. Most rural households were still
heavily weighted towards providing their own basic subsistence. It was still
essentially a subsistence economy of small producers relying primarily on
family labor and consuming most of their produce in their own houses. Of
course, that would vary regionally and socially. In most areas there was a
minority of those large yeoman farmers I mentioned last time. They were
attuned to supplying medium- to long-distance markets with agricultural
produce, provisioning the towns and so forth, and they were producers on a substantial
scale heavily engaged in marketing. But it&#39;s been estimated by the
agricultural historian Mark Overton that about 80% of English farming in the
early sixteenth century was actually oriented towards the subsistence of the
farm family itself and only a small part of their produce being marketed. Well,
whether the flow of household resources depended on self-provisioning or on
selling in the market it provided people with their living and often quite a
bare living. </p>
<p>Overton, whom I
mentioned, has also calculated the incomes that could be expected by farmers in
this period. A big yeoman who had a hundred acres of land growing wheat could
not only feed his family but would probably earn, Overton reckons, about seventy
pounds a year--quite a substantial income--from his production. On the other
hand, a small husbandman with only about ten acres would probably have only
enough left to sell to yield him two or three pounds a year--so an enormous
difference in the cash income that they could generate. So for many of these
families, the smaller husbandmen, they had a fairly narrow margin and that was
in normal times. These estimates have to be transformed when you get the event
of a bad harvest. If the harvest failed a big farmer, a big yeoman farmer, would
still be able to feed his family and prices would shoot up because of
shortages, so he might still make a considerable income. But in such
circumstances the small farmer might not be able to feed his own family; he
might fall behind on his rent; he might have to buy grain in the market at
inflated prices. It could be a disastrous circumstance. And for landless wage
earners it could be even harder. They didn&#39;t produce their own food, they
would have to buy it at very high prices. Well, bad years like that were
relatively rare but they were unpredictable. In the 1520s, there were two very
bad years like that. In the 1550s, there were three. There was another run of
very bad harvests in the 1590s and so one could go on. It was one of the
hazards of life. One can understand why people sometimes in the diaries that
they left behind them are looking anxiously at the weather as the harvest
approaches. </p>
<p>Other sources of
insecurity could be equally unpredictable. The high mortality rates of the
period could pose a real threat. The worst circumstances would be the outbreak
of an epidemic, usually an epidemic of bubonic plague. When an epidemic hit a
city, as they periodically did, you might get 20 or 30% of the entire
population dying within a period of months. The city of York, the greatest
city of the north of England--up here --York suffered no fewer than seven
epidemics of bubonic plague between 1485 and 1550. So this was another hazard
of life which would periodically strike, devastating the households that were
infected. Besides epidemics, though, there was also the constant threat of
infectious diseases which nowadays would be cleared up in a matter of days with
antibiotics. This meant that death rates were fairly high for adults. Very
few people lived &#39;til sixty, and also you have the hazards of death in childbed
for women and of course accidental deaths. These threats could hit the
prosperous and the poor alike and the accident of death at a bad moment in any
household could prove absolutely disastrous. This was a period that had no
life insurance. It was a period which had no pensions for those who were left
behind. Average life expectation at birth in the sixteenth century was
actually about thirty-three. That&#39;s average. If you made it to twenty, you
would probably live &#39;til your forties but most people died in their forties or
fifties. </p>
<p>Okay. All of these
somber realities add up to an environment of risk for the household,
threatening its viability and survival, and that inevitably influenced people&#39;s
mentalities. It&#39;s been suggested that people in this period tended to value
security and stability over change and growth. Their economic strategies in
particular were often very defensive, designed to minimize risks rather than to
maximize opportunities. So, their first priority was survival. </p>
<p>The second major
priority was to provide for the future well-being of the members of the
household and their future capacity, if they were young, to be able to form and
sustain households of their own when they reached the appropriate age. And in
this process there are three crucial moments in the life of the household: there&#39;s
the &#39;putting forth&#39; of children into the world as they put it; there&#39;s marriage
and the arrangements associated with it; and there was the transmission of
property to the new generation through inheritance. These were all aspects of
the way in which households were gradually dispersed. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s look first at
the aspect of dispersal involving young people, their leaving home to enter the
households of others as servants and as apprentices. The institution of
service was well attuned to accommodating the needs of different households. At
any one point in time some households, often the poorer ones, would have
children who were coming to an age at which they were capable of a fuller
working role but there wasn&#39;t really enough to usefully employ them at home;
their labor wasn&#39;t needed. Other households, however, would require additional
labor either temporarily because their children were young, too young to work,
or permanently because their children had grown and left home. If you look at
the back of your handout you&#39;ll see a couple of examples of sixteenth-century
households. </p>
<p>Now that&#39;s
sixteenth-century handwriting at the bottom. This is from a census which was
made. These are households of yeoman farmers and you&#39;ll see that there are no
children in those households but there are lots of servants. Some of them are
described as husbandmen. They&#39;re farm workers living in the household with
these yeoman farmers and most of them, as you&#39;ll see, are pretty young; they&#39;re
in their late teens or early twenties. That&#39;s what sixteenth-century
households of this particular type would have looked like. Well, the basic
logic of the system, then, was the transfer of children from one household to
another according to need, but there was also more to it than that. </p>
<p>Service was also a
way in which young people learned skills. It was a way in which they gained
experience and of course they earned a small wage which they could often save. It
also served to kind of redistribute the young across an area from the village
in which they were born. They would move from master to master around the area
in which they lived, and they would become familiar with the economic
opportunities available to them in their region--gradually, when they reached
sufficient age and maturity, getting a notion of where they might settle
permanently, marry and set up their own households. They would often be hired
annually at the servant&#39;s hiring fair, and there&#39;s been a very good study of a
hiring fair done by a woman called Ann Kussmaul who has written an excellent
book on servants. And she shows how you would have a little town where the
hiring fair was and servants who might be placed in households scattered around
the area would come in to get hired, and then they might be hired by a master
which would take them out to the other side of the particular catchment area of
this hiring fair. So as year gave way to year servants would be whizzing
backwards and forwards around this area, and she shows from year to year how
that happened, and then eventually they&#39;d settle. </p>
<p>Well, a lot of this
was relevant to apprentices also, but with the apprenticeship system, of
course, the advantaging mechanism and the skill training aspect was much more
prominent. Families invested in the children who went out as apprentices. They
paid a fee to their masters and they expected that in future, when they had
finished their apprenticeship, they would set up as master craftsmen
themselves. So service and apprenticeship were the conventional ways of
preparing young people for the future assumption of adult responsibilities, and
for most of them that came with marriage. </p>
<p>Marriage was the
point at which they were transformed into householders and, like leaving home,
it was a point of transition at which individual desires and individual
ambitions had to be reconciled with the larger strategies of the households
they belonged to. The making of a marriage was quite a complex process. It&#39;s
left a lot of records and quite a few excellent studies have been done of it. It
was rarely simply a matter of parents arranging the marriages of the young. That
was certainly known. Parents were more than happy to present potential
candidates to their children and amongst the aristocracy arrangement of matches
amongst their children was very common. These were families in which marriage
might have great social and political significance and it was too important to
leave to the young people themselves. But in general young people were
permitted a considerable degree of personal choice in selecting their marriage
partners provided they did so by choosing within a pool of people who were
considered acceptable; that&#39;s to say a pool of eligible partners of appropriate
social and economic standing. They had an ideal of parity in marriage; like
married like. </p>
<p>When they talk of a
&#39;match&#39; they mean exactly that; they&#39;re matching social equals. And, whether
the courtships were initiated by the young people themselves or whether they
were responding to initiatives and suggestions taken by their parents or their
guardians, the successful completion of a match was subject to what one
historian has called &quot;multilateral consent.&quot;<sup>1</sup> It&#39;s not a unilateral matter for the young people
alone. It&#39;s not a unilateral arrangement by the parents alone. It&#39;s a matter
of multilateral consent, that is to say the agreement and support of all interested
parties, notably their parents but also their close kin, sometimes their
brothers and sisters, anyone who had an interest. That could--that kind of
influence could--sometimes be exerted quite sensitively, but sometimes it could
be asserted quite brutally. William Perkins, the famous puritan preacher,
advised one young woman who was worried about the marriage that had been
proposed to her by her father. He advised her: </p>
<p>&quot;thy virginity
is not all thine to dispose of. In part it is thy parents. Thy father hath a
stroke in it; thy mother hath another, and kindred a third. Fight not against
all, but be his whom they would have thee.&quot; </p>
<p>Well, in that case
all that&#39;s required of her is her consent, but it may have been very unwilling.
</p>
<p>Among families that
had little or no property, agreement, or the &#39;good will&#39;, as they often put it,
of others was largely a matter of simply moral force. Young people from the
poorer ranks had a good deal more freedom of movement. They provided for their
own independence largely from their own earnings and their own savings, and
often it took them years to do so, but they were under less pressure from their
families. One young woman who was preparing for her eventual independence was
a young woman called Isabel Fowler who died unmarried around about 1550 and
whose goods were listed when she died. She was still a servant at the time. She
had a chest, and in her chest she had some clothes and some domestic utensils
and some bedding. Her master was holding three pounds of accumulated wages for
her. He was kind of acting as her banker, and in addition she had three cows
which her master was allowing her to run with his herd. So Isabel was clearly
sort of getting it together for a potential marriage and sadly she died; she
never made it, but she would have been a good catch if she had. [Laughter]
</p>
<p>Well, amongst people
with property whether they were small farmers or higher up the social scale the
economic arrangements were somewhat more complicated. One contemporary
observer said, &quot;young folk be come together for love, but parents must
cast how they shall live.&quot; Together the two families would provide a
conjugal fund. The groom was expected--it was expected that his family would
help to provide a dwelling and a means of livelihood. The bride would bring
what was called her &#39;portion&#39;, her portion of goods or money or perhaps even
land with which her family would endow her. These resources would be partly
accumulated by the young people but depended crucially at this social level
upon parental help through either inheritance or transfers of property, and the
sums involved could be quite substantial. In 1500, for example, one study
shows that the portions which were given to daughters of the gentry in the
county of Kent, which is down here in the southeast, averaged around 280
pounds. It was quite a lot of money in the early sixteenth century which these
gentry families had to find for their daughters. </p>
<p>Villagers in the same
county, of course, provided much lower sums but it could range up to twenty or thirty
pounds. But, whatever the level, settling these matches involved some pretty
hard bargaining amongst the families concerned. There&#39;s a lot of evidence of
the way in which people calculated what their families could afford, how the
families of the bride and groom hammered it out and negotiated over the
portions, and all of this of course had its implications for the younger
children in the family. What would be left for them? They had a say. And they
also needed to calculate what the family could afford if it was to remain
itself viable economically. So it involved a lot of strategic thinking when a
marriage was proposed, and if all of that was successfully resolved a match
would be concluded, a new household would be established and endowed. If not,
the denial of parental support could be catastrophic for the marriage hopes of
the young people concerned. If these things interest you, I recommend in
particular a book on the reading list by Diana O&#39;Hara, <i>Courtship and
Constraint</i>. It&#39;s a wonderful study of sixteenth-century courtship. </p>
<p>Well, putting your
children forth as adolescents and then matchmaking at the time of marriage were
also linked in different ways to the question of inheritance, the way in which resources
were transferred between the generations. It&#39;s generally true to say that
sixteenth-century English society favored primogeniture, the lion&#39;s share going--of
the family property--going to the eldest son. But they also believed that an
equitable provision should be made for younger children; they should receive
some portion of goods to help them into adult life. One Tudor lawyer said that
in his view &quot;a good and natural loving father&quot; would exercise &quot;care and
providence to advance every of his children, according to his ability, with a
portion of living or substance&quot;. And nor was it a matter for the fathers alone because
if they laid down in their wills the division of their goods amongst their
children it&#39;s also very clear that the successful completion of these family
strategies usually depended upon the sustaining of the household economy after
the father&#39;s death by their widows. It was usual in people&#39;s wills for the
widow to be named executor with full control of the family property until either
her death or the age of majority of the eldest son. It was simply assumed that
these women had the experience and the capability to do all that was required,
and that leads us to a final aspect of the household, the question of authority
and power within this structure of relationships. </p>
<p>All of the household
strategies that I&#39;ve been talking about had a certain sort of collective
element you could say, the quality of jointness. The interests of the
different individuals intersect. You have to accommodate the collective
interest of the household as a unit with that of the individuals who comprised
it and had their own expectations and perhaps ambitions. But one might well
ask whether decision making within households was truly collective. Households,
like society in general, were organized on a principle of hierarchical
differentiation. People&#39;s duties and people&#39;s entitlements were conceived of
in accordance with their place within that hierarchy. The household economy,
as we&#39;ve seen, involved interdependence, it involved complementary effort, but
the contributions of members were not necessary of equal weight; they weren&#39;t
necessarily of equal value in contemporary views. One could say that in many
ways the household was, in a sense, a sphere of altruism in which the interests
of others were taken into consideration, but at the same time there could be
clashes of personality and there could be competition over resources. </p>
<p>The law and
contemporary ideology left no doubt about where ultimate authority lay in
managing all of this. It lay of course with the household head. But it&#39;s
equally apparent when one has glimpses of households in action that the
personal dynamics of the household were often far more complex than that
stereotype. We have the stereotype of uncontested patriarchal domination. The
reality turns out to be far more variegated. The fact that women were
subordinated as a sex didn&#39;t preclude recognition of their competence; it
didn&#39;t preclude recognition of their judgment. Such qualities were expected of
them and they were daily displayed in the conduct of household affairs as we&#39;ve
seen. Accordingly, you find in the evidence that wives were very often far
from being the silent spectators of the decisions that were made regarding their
family&#39;s well-being. </p>
<p>The evidence of
matchmaking shows that they had a very real voice in either negotiating the
terms of the marriages of their children or in opposing or approving particular
candidates. The evidence we have regarding the making of people&#39;s wills shows
that women were often heavily involved, advising their husbands on the terms of
their wills and sometimes indeed disputing them. They were the ones who would
ultimately have to administer and execute those wills and they had a voice in
their making. And they appear elsewhere making their voices heard and indeed
being listened to. Outside the context of the household most women could of
course exercise little public authority, but within it they clearly had a
recognized role and that recognized role conferred certain rights and certain
entitlements. Anthony Fitzherbert in <i>The Book of Husbandry </i>advised that
both wife and husband should from time to time make what he called &quot;reckonings&quot;
with one another. He was thinking of their economic activities, that they
should make reckonings of their activities with one another, and he went on: </p>
<p>&quot;for if one of
them should use to deceive the other he deceiveth himself and is not likely to
thrive, and therefore they must be true eyther to other.&quot; </p>
<p>That&#39;s just one
statement of an ideal of mutuality within marriage, within the management of
the household, which of course found its immediate expression every day in the
day-to-day activities of households. That certainly didn&#39;t transform them into
spheres of equality of course. But it could and did involve the development of
working relationships of mutual support and mutual respect in the pursuit of
priorities that were essentially shared. So, in short, the household was
certainly a sphere of power, it was certainly a sphere of authority, but it was
one in which their exercise was also constantly influenced by the play of the
individual personalities of those involved. And I think if one wants to work
on this kind of problem one needs to be sensitive to the balance between these
various elements. </p>
<p>So, to conclude,
society and economy in the early modern period has been described by one
historian, David Rollison, as a &quot;culture of households in a landscape.&quot;<sup>2</sup>
The household was certainly fundamental and it was fundamental to both
continuity and change in the social history of the period. A lot of the
characteristics that I&#39;ve been describing endured throughout the whole of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but some aspects of household life did change.
They changed with changing circumstances. </p>
<p>Some of the changes
which took place in this period in a variety of spheres--in economy, in
population, in social structure, in culture--had their influence upon household
relationships. Some of them threatened the viability of household economies,
some aspects of economic and population change for example. Some changes
provided new opportunities, new opportunities for the consumption of household
goods, new opportunities for the education of children and other things which
we&#39;ll see in due course in later lectures. In general, one could also say that
the course of change in this period and the outcomes of change crucially
involved the responses to changing circumstances of thousands of households,
and all of their members had a hand in those responses. </p>
<p>It was never just a
matter of impersonal social forces acting upon households. Individuals and
families made their decisions, adapted their strategies in accordance with
their values, in accordance with their priorities in meeting the various
changes of the period, and thinking about it that way is helpful, I think,
because when we think about it that way we can give some of the abstractions
and generalizations about the great processes that took place in the early
modern period something of a human face at the level of the household, and in
many ways it&#39;s the capacity of historians to recapture the shifting expressions
on those faces which makes these things worth studying. </p>
<p>Okay. Well, next
time I&#39;ll go on to look at various kinds of communities and their institutions
and patterns of relationships. Any questions, just please come up. </p>
