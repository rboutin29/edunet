<p><b>Professor Keith
Wrightson:</b> For
the last three weeks, then, we&#39;ve been going through some of the major
developments in terms of political and religious change in the course of the
sixteenth century, and for the next three weeks we&#39;ll be looking at other
aspects of what was going on in the reign of Elizabeth and under the early
Stuarts, dealing with a number of themes that run across from about 1560 to
1640 and then we&#39;ll return to the political narrative. So I&#39;m going to look at
things like witchcraft and crime and popular protest and education and the
growth of literacy. But first of all this week, in order to understand all of
these developments and create the context of change, we need to know what was
going on in economy and society, both of which were changing in their structure
quite significantly in these two generations at the turn of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. And today I&#39;ll focus on the economic developments. So,
a bit of economic history.</p>

<p>Economic history is
rarely immensely popular but it does matter. It&#39;s absolutely basic. It&#39;s
perhaps an unfamiliar kind of history. It&#39;s mostly done in economics
departments, but what I&#39;ll try to do basically is to give you a clear overview
of what we know about what seems to have been happening in this period and your
handout will provide you with some statistics to chart the overall developments
and illustrate some of the details. </p>

<p>Okay. So by the
1560s already, as you know, population growth and price inflation had impacted
to some degree upon established patterns of social relationships especially on
the land between landlords and tenants. In this situation there was need for
sustained economic expansion if a growing population was to be maintained and
in particular if the younger generation were to be able to find employment, to
enjoy living standards comparable to those of their parents, and such expansion
needed to be considerable if it was to keep pace with continued population
rise. If you look at your handout, table number one there, we have the best
figures available for population showing that by the beginning of Elizabeth&#39;s
reign in 1561 it had already reached about three million, by 1601 it had topped
four million, and by 1641 the population had risen to just over five million. </p>

<p>In fact, the
population in England seems to have been rising faster and for rather longer
than was generally the case in Europe at the time. Between the 1520s and the
1640s, the population of England and Wales roughly doubled whereas in most
European countries which--continental European countries--which have been studied
the rise was something like 50%. That suggests that whatever the population
rise in England had in common with what was going on elsewhere in Europe,
perhaps in terms of its origins, it was nonetheless being sustained rather
longer, perhaps because of factors peculiar to the English situation. There
seems to have been a capacity to absorb increased numbers of people to a
somewhat greater extent than in much of continental Europe. And that this
could happen at all is of course an indication that some kind of economic
expansion was probably going on. And so the question arises and has been
extensively investigated as to what were the areas of economic expansion in
this period. </p>

<p>Well, in a
predominantly rural society, of course, we need to begin with agriculture. And
if you look at table two on your handout, 2(a), there&#39;s an index there of
agricultural output. It&#39;s the best estimate currently available, calculated by
the agricultural historian Mark Overton, and it suggests that grain output rose
by about 38% in England between 1550 and 1600 and by a further 26% between 1600
and 1650. Over the entire period something like a 75% increase in grain output.
Well, how did they achieve that?</p>

<p>One thing they did
was to extend the cultivated area. In fact, very little land was not used at
all so really this was largely a matter of changing the use of the land so as
to increase the intensity of its use. They did that in many ways. One way was
by clearing woodlands and bringing the woodland into arable production. A good
deal of that went on in the heavily wooded areas of the West Midlands here, and
elsewhere piecemeal. Another thing they did was to drain waterlogged land and
to reclaim it for agriculture. There was a good deal of that going on
piecemeal around the country. Down here in eastern England for example a lot
of salt marsh along the coast was brought in permanently. They built dikes so
that it wouldn&#39;t flood and drained it, much in the manner that was practiced in
the Netherlands, of course, and brought that land into permanent pasture use.</p>

<p>A lot of wasteland
was plowed up and brought into cultivation. There was a lot of piecemeal
change of that kind wherever wasteland was available, but there were also some
very large projects of that kind which were sponsored and overseen by the royal
privy council. In the west of England a lot of forested land was
&#39;disafforested&#39; by the crown; that is its status as forest land was canceled. Woodlands
were cleared. Land was brought into cultivation all over the west. Another
major scheme was in the fenlands of East Anglia. The fens were from the 1620s
onwards gradually drained and that land was brought into cultivation. Dutch
engineers were brought in because of their expertise in draining land, building
dikes, drainage channels and so forth. It&#39;s because of that drainage which
took place in the seventeenth century that if you drive through that area
you&#39;ll find the roads are higher than the surrounding land. </p>

<p>Well, much change
then of this kind going on, and this tended to recast the balance between
arable and pastoral production in the kingdom as a whole. It also furthered
increased specialization in accordance with the best use of the land. In the forest
of Arden, for example, in Warwickshire an area which was previously largely an
area of grazing in forest clearances [correction: clearings] much of the forest
was cleared and the land went over from meat production to arable and dairying.
Amongst the arable crops they began growing more barley as well as wheat to
diversify the product. They generally increased the food base of the area. They
were producing milk and cheese and grain as well as meat, and you get other
areas where there&#39;s even more diversification. Down in Kent to the southeast of
London. Northern Kent became an area specializing in producing wheat for the
bakers of London. Other areas of the county specialized in fattening cattle
which were driven down from the north, fattened up and then went to butchers in
London. There were areas specializing in hop production, as there still are,
for the brewers of London; areas specializing in market gardening for the city.
</p>

<p>Proximity to the vast
food market of London, of course, encouraged specialization of that kind. And
such specialization in various parts of the kingdom in turn encouraged
intensification of cultivation. Sometimes that was by introducing technical
changes in agricultural production. There was a lot of attention paid to
better forms of manuring the land, not just using animal muck but also
spreading lime on the fields or &#39;marling&#39; the fields. Marl is a kind of chalky
clay. They would dig it up and spread it on the fields and then plow it in. Techniques
of that kind had the effect of reducing the acidity of the soil and they
encouraged nitrogen mineralization which encouraged the fertility of the soil. They
didn&#39;t know the chemistry of what was happening, but they knew that it worked
and techniques of this kind were quite widely practiced. </p>

<p>There were also
technical changes in the form of changing rotations in the use of land between
having it down to grass or plowing it up for arable crops, in particular an
innovation which is known as convertible husbandry, or up and down husbandry,
it was often called. Previously, the practice had been in the great open
fields around villages to leave one of them fallow each year. It would be
rested for a single year and then brought back into production. Convertible
husbandry was a much more efficient form of rotation. You would leave the
grass--the land down to grass for quite a long time, ten years, twelve years
perhaps, then plow it up for just two or three years and then put it down to
grass again. The effect of this change in rotation was that the land was--got
its heart restored better. You got greatly improved cereal yields when it was
plowed up for arable, but at the same time you had more of your acreage down to
grass at any one time, so you could keep more animals. So they could increase
both their output of grain and the density of the livestock which they raised. This
practice, up and down or convertible husbandry, had long been known in some
areas but it gradually spread as a particularly efficient practice, and it
spreads all over lowland England between about the 1580s and the 1650s. </p>

<p>And finally, change
of all these kinds could be facilitated by enclosing the land into individually
managed farms. As you know, in the sixteenth century there&#39;d been great
hostility to enclosure for pasture which took land out of arable production. In
the late sixteenth century, partly because of this hostility to enclosure, the
enclosure movement slackened, but at the turn of the seventeenth century it
began to pick up again. In the central England county of Leicestershire in the--what
people refer to as the Midland Plain of central England, for example, about a
third of the county had already been enclosed by 1550. In the second half of
the sixteenth century, only 5% more was enclosed. The movement slackened. But
in the early seventeenth century it picked up again and 40% more of the county
was enclosed. Similar figures have been produced for other areas particularly
in the Midlands. </p>

<p>Well, this second
wave of enclosure, of dividing up the fields and common into smaller fields
individually managed, it was different in two respects from the earlier
enclosure movement. First of all, it was now not so much enclosure for
conversion to pasture, especially conversion to sheep ranching. Now it tended
to be enclosure for the practice of improved arable husbandry or convertible
husbandry. When the forests of the west were cleared and the fens of the east
were drained, the land brought into production tended to be divided up into
individual fields and then let out to local farmers where they practiced
convertible husbandry in their enclosed farms. </p>

<p>Secondly, this
differed because it was not a thing which was just pushed through unilaterally
by the local gentry who wanted to create sheep ranches in the early sixteenth
century. Now it was a movement which tended to proceed by
agreement--agreements which would be struck between local gentlemen and the
principal local farmers, their biggest tenants in the main. And so you find all
over the kingdom local communities coming to agreements of this kind to enclose
the common fields or the common pastures. To take just one example, there&#39;s a
village up in the West Midlands called Highley, which has been much studied,
and it has excellent records, and at Highley, for example, it was in the 1610s
and the 1620s that the open fields of the parish were gradually enclosed little
by little by agreement, and then they rounded the whole thing off by dividing
up and portioning out the woodlands and common pasture of the manor. </p>

<p>The whole idea of
this was to create consolidated farms which would be under the individual
management of a particular farmer. That gave those farmers freedom of movement
in managing and adapting their husbandry practice as they saw fit. Intensification
of methods was not impossible in the old open fields, but it was much easier on
farms under individual management, and in consequence the old communally
managed customary system of agriculture gradually weakened. It weakened its
hold on agricultural organization generally, survived in some areas, but in
many parts of the country it was gradually disappearing and in some it was
almost wholly extinguished. </p>

<p>Right. Overall,
various combinations of changes of this kind appear to have boosted
agricultural output considerably, even boosting the yields per acre, the
productivity of the land. The study which is represented by the figures on two--table
2(b)--on your handout of land productivity in a number of counties, a study
based upon farmers&#39; inventories--the crops that are recorded in their
inventories and also on some surviving account books--this suggests that in
these counties cereal yields, numbers of bushels per acre, rose by about 15% in
the late sixteenth century and by another 4% in the early seventeenth century. </p>

<p>Okay. Well, gradual
change of this kind in agriculture implies that there existed a larger market
for agricultural produce and in some ways a more distant market for
agricultural produce that farmers were trying to serve. And those markets were
found, as you would imagine, above all in the towns and in those areas of the
countryside which had large populations which were engaged in activities other
than agriculture; industrial areas of the countryside. This was a period of
very marked urbanization, very significant urban growth. Some of the figures
are there on table three on your handout for a number of cities. In Worcester,
for example, the population rose between 1550 and 1650 from just over 4,000 to
roughly 8,000. In Norwich the population of the city rose from about 10,000 to
over 30,000. And above all there was massive population growth in the city of
London. The figures are there for you. In 1550, London was already about
70,000, by 1600 200,000, by 1650 400,000 and still growing. By 1600, London
already contained 5% of the national population. By 1650, London contained
just over 9% of the national population and was still growing, and today it&#39;s
about 10%. It had almost reached that proportion in the mid-seventeenth
century. So very significant urban growth. </p>

<p>All of that involved,
within particular cities, the taking up of vacant space within their walls for
building, the subdivision of existing housing and the growth of suburbs outside
the old city walls. In London, for example, by the 1580s there were complaints
by the local authorities of what they called &quot;pestering of houses with diverse
families&quot; or multiple occupation. Or again &quot;multitudes of people&quot;--these are
quotations--&quot;multitudes of people brought to inhabit in small rooms and...
heaped up together and in a sort almost smothered,&quot; said one report. Overcrowding;
congestion. </p>

<p>In addition, in the
parishes outside the city walls there was significant suburban growth. The
parishes of east London, to the east of the Tower of London, the modern East
End, in the 1570s contained about 7,000 people already. So there was already a
significant population in these parishes just outside the old city walls. By
the 1630s, there were 50,000 people in the east London suburbs. Or if we turn
to western London the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, which was literally
in the fields in the mid-sixteenth century, had a population of about 600 when
Elizabeth came to the throne. By the 1630s, St. Martin&#39;s had a population of
18,000. So this single London suburban parish contained more people than most
of the cities in other parts of the kingdom. The Church of St.
Martin-in-the-Fields is the one that stands beside Trafalgar Square today right
in the heart of the city. </p>

<p>Well, this formidable
urban growth occurred despite alarming levels of urban mortality in the
overcrowded, increasingly insanitary towns. They didn&#39;t have adequate water
supply. They didn&#39;t have adequate sanitation measures. &#39;Background mortality&#39;,
ordinary, everyday mortality from infectious disease in the towns was very bad,
far worse than in the countryside. Even within the cities it could vary quite
significantly. For example, in the late sixteenth century average life
expectation at birth in the wealthier districts of London was thirty to thirty-five.
Average life expectation of birth in the poorer parishes of the East End was
only twenty to twenty-five. </p>

<p>The towns were also
prone, of course, to catastrophic &#39;crisis morality&#39; in the form of epidemics,
particularly epidemics of bubonic plague. Norwich saw five major epidemics of
bubonic plague between 1579 and 1640. London also saw five in the same period
and most other major cities witnessed a number. These outbreaks could kill 10-15%
of the population or even worse. In York in 1604, which was a really bad year,
when the plague spread from city to city across the kingdom--in York in that
year roughly 30% of the population died. In Newcastle up here in the northeast
in 1636 an estimated 47% of the population died between May and October of that
year. These were absolutely devastating events and they were at their worst in
the poorer, overcrowded, dirtier areas of the cities. It&#39;s been said by Paul
Slack, who&#39;s written a wonderful book about the impact of the plague, that
there was a &quot;distinct urban topography&quot; of the plague. The disease was no
respecter of persons, but it raged at its worst under certain social conditions.</p>

<p>And yet despite these
appalling catastrophes the towns continued to grow, London above all. One of
the earliest demographers, a man named John Graunt who published a study based
upon the mortality figures for London which were regularly collected by the
city authorities to keep an eye on the epidemic disease situation. He studied
them for the first time. He made various projections on the basis of those
figures. He was a great pioneer of the use of statistical information. He
came to the conclusion--I&#39;m quoting him--&quot;let the mortality be what it
will, this city repairs itself within two years.&quot; The loss of inhabitants
could be rapidly replaced. And the evidence is that this was so, and of course
the loss was replaced primarily by continued migration to the towns. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been calculated
that in order to replace the numbers who died under these dreadful mortality
conditions and to continue to grow in the way that it did London needed an
average of 6,000 new people a year coming in to the city to replace its losses
and grow. And the evidence is that they came. Some of them came as what one
demographer describes as &quot;betterment migrants,&quot; people who came to the city in
fairly confident expectation of better opportunities.<sup>1</sup>
They might come in as apprentices to be apprenticed to a particular trade,
their apprenticeship having been arranged by members of their family. They
might be people who came in with a known place to fill. Very often for example
they might have relatives already in the city who would encourage their
migration to join them. A very interesting study by Vivien Brodsky of single
women marrying for the first time in London and taking out licenses to marry,
which give us some details of their circumstances, she finds, interestingly,
that two fifths of these single women marrying in London had kin in the city
with whom they were living at the time that they married. So they&#39;d come in
from the countryside, they were living with family members already in the city,
and then they established themselves and married there.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Other people came not
as betterment migrants with good prospects of that kind but as what have been
described as &quot;subsistence migrants,&quot; people looking for any opportunity to find
work and hoping that the city would provide it. And clearly it did, perhaps
not the opportunities that people hoped for--the streets of London were certainly
not paved with gold--but opportunities of a kind, to make a living of some
kind. The quickening urban economies of other cities also did the same. In
Colchester and in Norwich, for example, the cloth industry was expanding,
particularly with the help of refugees from the Netherlands, from the religious
wars of the Netherlands, who came and were placed in those cities by
Elizabeth&#39;s government and who were welcomed because they introduced certain
advanced cloth-making techniques, which helped to improve the local cloth
industry and assist its expansion. </p>

<p>In London above all
you get a spectacular diversification of manufacturing activity. In east
London along the river there were shipyards. There were also businesses
producing all sorts of other goods ancillary to the shipping industry: rope
making, sail making, coopers making barrels, people making pulleys, pulley
makers for the ropes that held--for the rigging of the ships. In London you
also find textiles, especially luxury textiles, a massive brewing industry,
metal trades, sugar refining, starch making, soap making, glass making, and so
one could go. And then of course there was all the activity around the wharves
and the river in what was England&#39;s greatest trading city. </p>

<p>So urban economies were
expanding. The numbers of apprentices being taken on were growing, the level
of activity was growing, the activities themselves were proliferating. But
manufacturing in other industries also extended well beyond the cities. Manufacturing
of some products had long been established in rural villages under the &#39;putting
out&#39; system, and this period also witnessed considerable growth in activities
of this kind. It rarely involved really significant technological change of
the kind that we associate with the industrial revolution and the birth of the
factory system, but what it often saw was the adoption, or the imitation, of
the best practices known at the time and the diversification of the products
which were being produced, and there was also something of a spread in the
geographical location of various kinds of manufacturing activity. </p>

<p>As you know, the
premier traditional industry was the production of woolen broadcloth, most of
it exported to the Netherlands where traditionally it was finished and then
passed on to markets across Europe. This traditional industry had had
something of a crisis of overproduction in the 1550s and thereafter found that
its markets were somewhat declining. Its overseas markets were somewhat
declining and it faced pretty stiff competition from the Dutch. But the textile
industries continued to expand nonetheless. The most dynamic areas of textiles
were not the old broadcloth industry but the production of what they called the
&quot;new draperies.&quot; The new draperies. These were lighter, fully finished, more
colorful cloths rather like modern suit cloth. If old--if the old broadcloths
were rather like a heavy blanket, then if you imagine modern suiting cloths
that&#39;s what the new draperies were like, worsteds of various kinds. They had
lovely names for them. They were always inventing fancy names for these new
cloths: Bays and Says and Perpetuanas and Calimancoes. All of these were
different forms of worsted cloth. </p>

<p>The new draperies
were centered in the towns of East Anglia where they had been- where their
establishment had been greatly assisted by the influx of skilled refugees from
the Netherlands. They brought their expertise and they helped to revive and
transform the cloth industries of those areas especially around Norwich and
Colchester. But the new draperies were not the whole story of textile
diversification. Up in Lancashire around the town of Manchester, which at this
time was not a great city but a small market town, there was the growth in the
late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries of the manufacture of so-called
&quot;fustians.&quot; Fustians involved a mixture of cotton and linen and the production
of this cloth--it was cheap, coarse cloth for the home market, cloth for the
poor--was centered around Manchester. It&#39;s the distant ancestor of what was
later to be the great cotton industry of the city of Manchester. </p>

<p>Another thing that
was spreading in many rural areas was stocking knitting. The wives of farmers
and agricultural laborers were often involved in knitting high-quality
stockings. Many people knitted stockings for themselves, but there was a
market for high-quality stockings supplied by people working in that way. The
stocking industry spread all over Norfolk, spread across the Midlands into the
Nottinghamshire area, which is actually still to this day a center for the
manufacture of stockings and underwear. Marks and Spencer&#39;s gets a lot of
stuff from Nottinghamshire and so on. One could talk about silks, luxury
textiles. Silks were introduced by French Protestant refugees from southern
France and silk production became established principally in eastern London and
also in the town of Canterbury in Kent. </p>

<p>So, a lot of
diversification, not only in woolen textiles but in some new developments like
silk. And this was part of a larger diversification of manufacturing in town
and country. A lot of the new--the altogether new manufacturers which were
introduced were really forms of import substitution encouraged by the royal
government so that things could be produced at home rather than imported. Traditionally,
a great deal of miscellaneous manufactured goods actually were imported,
principally from the Netherlands or north Germany. Under Elizabeth the privy
council was very responsive indeed to anyone with good ideas for introducing
these things into England. They would often encourage them by granting them a
patent which would give them the monopoly of producing a certain item for a
stated period of years, after which it would be open to anyone who wished to
participate in the industry once it was established. It&#39;s the origins of the
patent system, of course. </p>

<p>Well, numerous
patents were granted. To take some examples, which may seem almost silly but
they mattered. Pins. One doesn&#39;t usually think of pins when one thinks of
major economic expansion, but in 1597 England imported 40,000 pounds&#39; worth of
pins from the Netherlands. That&#39;s a lot of pins, and a lot of money. In the
first decade of the seventeenth century, pin manufacturing was established
under patent in the suburbs of London. They mostly employed children making
the pins. By the 1630s, the patent had expired and it spread beyond London,
became particularly established in villages in the west of England in the
Gloucestershire area. From about this time onward, most English pins were
produced at home, and so one could go on. Glass was nearly always imported
before the 1580s. Patents were then granted for introducing glass manufacture
particular--particularly to the counties of Kent and Sussex and then it spread
to some other places. There were glassworks around Newcastle very soon. By
the 1620s, nearly all glass bottles used in England were being produced at home
instead of imported, and so on. </p>

<p>Well, industries of
this kind were generally somewhat decentralized in their organization. They
were organized on the putting out system. They didn&#39;t involve a great deal in
the way of investment in fixed capital in the form of industrial plant,
machinery and so forth. Principally, they needed the capital to buy raw
materials, to pay workers who were working in their own cottages or workshops;
to market the finished goods. It was all done on the putting out system, but
there were a number of other industries which were also beginning to bring a
rather different face to industrial activity. Iron for example. </p>

<p>Iron manufacturing
really got going in the mid-sixteenth century when the technique of using blast
furnaces was introduced into England from Germany. It was greatly encouraged
by Elizabeth&#39;s privy council because they wanted iron production domestically
for the production of munitions. By the 1570s, there were over fifty blast
furnaces operating in the forests of the area known as the Weald, down here
towards the south coast, the forested area with fast-running streams which were
suitable for driving some of the machinery involved. In the early seventeenth
century, the industry in the Weald had stabilized, even declined a little, but
there was a great deal of relocation to south Wales, largely because that area
offered a combination of iron ore, forests to provide the timber to produce
charcoal for the blast furnaces, and also fast-running streams to drive the
machinery which was used in slitting mills in iron production, machinery driven
by water wheels. </p>

<p>All of this is very
interesting to go into in detail to see the technology they used, but I&#39;ll
spare you that, but it can be followed up if these things interest you. By...by
the 1580s, the levels of iron production of the 1550s had increased threefold. By
the 1640s, England was producing 23-24,000 tons of pig iron a year. Those were
the signs of things to come in the iron industry which continued to grow, but a
lot of iron was still imported from Scandinavia in particular, from Sweden
especially, to serve a growing industry producing metal wares and that was
centered in the West Midlands around the town of Birmingham. Metalware
production had taken place there for many years, indeed centuries, but was
greatly increasing. They produced there many metal products used in
agriculture and in the building industries and in shipping; nails and locks and
scythes and buckles, latches for doors, bits and stirrups for horses, and so
forth. All of this was organized by iron masters who lived in emerging towns
like Birmingham, Walsall, and Stourbridge, and they did it partly by employing
independent master craftsmen to produce specialized goods for them and also by
putting out work--putting out raw materials for the simpler items like nail making,
to cottagers who worked part time. And so one can go on. Lead production was
also expanding. Some of the figures are there in table four, 1560s only about
600 tons of lead produced per annum, by the 1630s well over 12,000. Lead
production was centered in the hills of Derbyshire and in parts of Somerset
where lead deposits were to be found. </p>

<p>And finally, perhaps
most spectacular of all in the introduction of these new heavier industries,
was the growth of the coal industry. The coal industry, centered around
Newcastle on the River Tyne, grew spectacularly under Elizabeth and the early
Stuarts in response above all to the demands for fuel exerted by London and
other growing cities. In the 1580s, Newcastle exported to London through the
coastal trade 50,000 tons of coal a year. By the 1640s, it was exporting
300,000 tons of coal per year in addition to which by 1640 another 200,000 tons
were being exported to other English cities. The coal industry could not have
grown as it did without the demand being exerted by these growing urban
centers. Those urban centers could not have grown as they did without the
fuel, the cheap fuel which was coming from the mines of the North. By 1650,
the Northeast alone--and there were coal fields in some other areas too--but the
Northeast alone was producing half a million tons of coal per annum, quite
extraordinary output. Just to give you a sense of what that might mean, a
recent historian of these developments has calculated that a ton of coal yields
roughly the same heat energy as the charcoal which could be produced by
harvesting timber on an acre of land. Okay? So same heat energy as the
timber from an acre of land. So, if you&#39;re producing half a million tons of
coal per annum you have in effect created half a million acres of land, as it
were, in terms of your--the capacity you would need in order to produce that
amount of heat energy, and that heat energy was used not only for domestic
heating but for any industrial process which required heat. They couldn&#39;t use
it for smelting iron yet but they could use it for many, many industrial
processes. Is that all clear? Good. You get the point. It&#39;s an interesting
way of representing the difference that that kind of industrial development
could make.<sup>3</sup>
</p>

<p>Okay. Well, much of
this built on existing foundations, but the sheer scale of expansion began to
give a very distinct regional geography to the English economy. There were
distinctive areas of agricultural specialization emerging and there were also
those areas which were rendered distinctive by their involvement in industrial
activity. One traveler traveling through the West Midlands near Birmingham in
the 1640s described it as being like &quot;one continued village,&quot; large village
after large village heavily involved in iron production. The Stour Valley area
stretching up from Colchester where the new draperies were well established was
described as with--continuing--consisting of a constellation of villages in
which a small number of clothiers set on work &quot;a great company of poor people.&quot;
There again there&#39;s the extraordinary moonscape which was emerging around the
Newcastle coal field area in which there were many, many individual pits
working down to depths of two or three hundred feet. And then they couldn&#39;t really
go any deeper because of drainage problems so they would simply open a new pit,
creating a kind of moonscape across that whole area. </p>

<p>This kind of regional
differentiation enhanced the redistribution of the population as people seeking
work moved to places which had the capacity to provide them with some kind of
employment, be it in agriculture of particular kinds or in industry. I&#39;ve
already touched on the migration to the towns. There was also migration to
certain rural areas which were becoming very densely populated, especially the
manufacturing districts, and those densely populated areas of course exerted
demand in their turn for the agricultural products of a more specialized
agriculture. Something of the redistribution of population which was going on
is summarized in section five of your handout. There are some figures
calculated by the demographer E. A. Wrigley showing that between 1520 and 1670
the rural agricultural population, those directly employed in agriculture, was
significantly reduced, the urban population living in towns of over 5,000 rose
from about 5.5% to over 13%, and the rural non-agricultural population rose
from about 18% to something like 26%. That&#39;s the people living in small towns
all working in rural industry. </p>

<p>All of this was of
course linked together by internal trade. The established arteries of internal
trade grew in their significance. Road traffic increased. Traffic around the
coast and on the rivers, a very good way of moving bulky goods, greatly
increased. Networks of internal trade were elaborated and tightened. If that
had not happened, then none of these developments would have been possible. The
emerging picture is one of an elaborating web of commercial interconnection
pulling the various regional economies together even more tightly than had
previously been the case. And this intensification of commercial activity
involved new commercial practices, and one of the best indicators of the sheer
extent of what was going on is actually provided by the evidence of the law
courts. </p>

<p>A great deal of the
litigation which took place in England&#39;s law courts concerned broken contracts,
disagreements over debts or the meeting of contractual obligations. There was
an absolutely massive rise in the amount of such business within the courts. If
you look at section six of your handout, you&#39;ll see that in 1560 just over 5,000
cases of this kind were heard by the central courts in London. By 1640, it was
almost 29,000 cases being heard a year. And this is just the tip of the
iceberg. These are the deals that went wrong and resulted in someone suing
someone else. One can only imagine the massive amount of commercial activity
which was going on. </p>

<p>Whereas in 1500,
then, a great deal of the marketing which had taken place in England was rather
localized, with some longer distance flows going across the kingdom in
particular commodities--cattle, cloth and so forth--by the early seventeenth
century one gets a picture of a society which was ever more closely interconnected
and integrated by market dealings and commercial transactions. This was in
short a commercializing society, an emerging market economy in which the living
and the daily economic dealings of a far larger proportion of the population
were shaped by the market. </p>

<p>And finally it wasn&#39;t
just becoming a more internally integrated commercial society, it was one which
was also linked increasingly to a larger world. Because the same decades in
the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries saw a transformation of
overseas trade, from a pattern which had been very much based on short-distance
traffic across the English Channel, a few voyages down to other French and
perhaps Spanish ports, but predominantly concentrated on the narrow seas, to
one in which English merchants were trading directly with far more diverse
areas of the world. </p>

<p>They began doing so
partly to look for new markets for English cloth, partly also to get direct
access to the source of much desired imports which had previously been obtained
from the Netherlands. They stopped trying to go direct to source; looking for
grain, for wine, for spices, for luxury textiles from far afield. The late
sixteenth century, of course, was the beginning of the great age of exploratory
voyages by English navigators, the voyages of Francis Drake, Martin Frobisher
and so forth. But the really significant thing from the point of view of the
economic development of the period were those who undertake--undertook trading
voyages to establish new trades, often with royal backing, often through
forming companies which would get a royal charter to conduct trade with
somewhere with which England had not previously traded direct. </p>

<p>So companies were
founded with royal charters to trade to the Baltic in search of the furs, the
grain of Poland, the timber products of Scandinavia, all of which had a place
in England&#39;s growing economy. Companies were founded to trade with Russia,
sailing north around Scandinavia to the port of Archangel. They intended to
proceed from there to get access to central Asian goods, though that was an
enterprise which didn&#39;t succeed, but they established trade with Muscovy. There
was increasing trade direct with Spain principally for wine and currants, which
were extremely popular. There was direct trade with Italy first of all and
then with the Levant, bringing in spices, luxury textiles, wine and other goods.
And finally, once the Muscovy company had learned that it could not
successfully reach the East via Russia, they imitated the Portuguese and went
the other way, around Africa to establish the trade with the East Indies with
the voyages of the East India Company chartered in 1599 and voyaging for the
first time in 1601. </p>

<p>All of these trades
once they had become established were consolidated and expanding in the course
of the early seventeenth century when they were joined by yet another area of
activity, the Atlantic trades. By the 1630s, there were already 300 English
ships a year fishing off Newfoundland and bringing back the fish to Europe
where dried cod was particularly popular in parts of southern Europe. And
increasingly trade had been established with the colonies established upon the
American mainland, after 1607, in Virginia and then Maryland of course, from
the 1620s onwards in the Northeast, and Caribbean colonies, notably Barbados,
being established in the same period. Jamaica wasn&#39;t conquered until the
1650s. </p>

<p>Most of these
colonies managed to get on their feet through establishing plantation economies
of course, and they produced the goods which were increasingly imported into
England and then sold on to other customers. Tobacco for example, tobacco
first being produced in large quantities from 1617 in Virginia, the salvation
of the colony. 60,000 thousand pounds of tobacco were being imported into
London already by 1622. By 1638, they were bringing in two million pounds of
tobacco per annum, and from-- yes, we&#39;re very ungrateful to tobacco,
[laughter] it had a major role. And that was followed from the
1640s by another product about which we&#39;re very ungrateful, sugar, being
produced in the West Indies and exported for refining in London.</p>

<p>So then we have a
panorama of economic expansion. Attempts to establish overall national income
in this period are extremely dodgy, but a number of heroic economic historians
have attempted to do it and you&#39;ll find the estimates there in section eight of
your table. It seems likely that between the 1560s and the 1590s national
income had risen by about 48% and it rose by a further 51% between the 1590s
and 1640, over the 80 years as a whole something like 120% growth in national
income in real terms. If they&#39;re right about that, and even if they&#39;re wrong
by 20%, it&#39;s still a lot. If they&#39;re right about that, it helps to account for
the fact that population growth was sustained as long as it was and for the
growing signs of prosperity which one finds throughout this period.</p>

<p>And yet despite those
positive and optimistic signs, as you&#39;ll see in the final table, table nine,
the prices of basic foodstuffs were still rising, suggesting that despite
increased output there was a continued imbalance between population and food
resources. The period also saw complaints of poverty and a continuing decline
in the purchasing power of wages, the declining real wages which you&#39;ll find in
the final column of that table on the right. </p>

<p>So having looked at
the panorama of economic expansion, what we have to do next time is to look at
how this growing national wealth was actually distributed socially and how the
trends of this period worked out in terms of the actual life chances of
particular social groups. And I&#39;ll do that on Thursday. </p>
