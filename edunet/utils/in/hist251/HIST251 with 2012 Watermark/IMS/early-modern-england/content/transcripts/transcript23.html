<p><b>Professor Keith Wrightson:
</b>Okay.
Let&#39;s get started. Right. Well, the Glorious Revolution of 1688, so-called,
which I described last time, began as a relatively bloodless coup, but it did
go on to usher in some pretty massive changes in the structure of government
and also in Britain&#39;s standing in the world. In the twenty years after the Revolution
Britain began to emerge as one of Europe&#39;s great powers, and we&#39;ll look at that
in the final full lecture after the break. But part of understanding that
change requires us to understand how Britain was able to sustain that kind of
role after 1688 and that brings us back to the economy, especially in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. </p>
<p>So you have your
lovingly handcrafted handout, a sort of artisan handout, and that contains the
basic facts and I&#39;ll take you through it. I always notice whenever I announce
there&#39;s going to be a lecture in economic history that it seems to have the
same effect as the great plague of 1666 [correction 1665] on our numbers; but
it matters. </p>
<p>Okay. Right. Well,
a few weeks ago I left the narrative of economic and social change at the point
in the mid-seventeenth century when population and prices began to stabilize
after over a century of growth but, as I said then, the dynamic of change that
had been unleashed in the later sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries
didn&#39;t stop. Rather it continued in a changing and increasingly favorable
climate, and central to that new context was the relative stability of
population and prices. </p>
<p>In 1641, as you&#39;ll
see on table one of your handout, the population was just over five million and
it remained at approximately that level for many decades to come. In fact, in
some parts of the late seventeenth century population growth rates for
particular decades were in fact negative. In 1701, the population was still
just over five million and it was only about five and a half million by the mid-eighteenth
century. Renewed growth didn&#39;t start until the late eighteenth century. </p>
<p>Well, the reasons for
this relative stability seem fairly clear in the light of research by
demographic historians. As table two indicates, fertility, as measured by the
gross rate of reproduction, reached its nadir in the third quarter of the
seventeenth century, and thereafter from about the 1670s it began to recover a
little but very, very slowly and it didn&#39;t reach its sixteenth-century levels
again until after 1760. </p>
<p>Any potential that
there might have been for renewed growth was choked off by two further factors.
First of all, the late seventeenth century saw a decline in life expectation
at birth. It was as low as thirty-three on average by the end of the
seventeenth century. It&#39;s a paradox that mortality was so bad in a period
which actually saw the final disappearance of plague from Britain. The
outbreak in London in 1665 to &#39;6 was the last great outbreak, but the absence
of that kind of crisis mortality didn&#39;t prevent generally high levels of what
the demographers refer to as background mortality from infectious diseases. One
of them, Mary Dobson, has shown that high levels of mortality were particularly
associated with urban centers, with low-lying areas, with poor water supplies,
with the growing industrial areas of the kingdom, and with the areas along significant
trade routes. And her suggestion is that these facts are the outcome of, in
the first place, denser concentrations of population in the cities and also
those areas which shared that density in the countryside and which were linked
by communications which made the transmission of infectious diseases that much
easier. A more closely interconnected society was one in which disease
transmission could take place more effectively. </p>
<p>So, mortality was
pretty bad in the late seventeenth century. And secondly a further factor was
migration. That was partly overseas migration. Between 1650 and 1699, almost
a quarter of a million migrants left England for overseas destinations; mostly
to the Americas, mostly going either to the West Indies or to the southern
colonies of mainland America as indentured servants. And a second part of the
migration factor was internal migration; internal movement of people to the
rather unhealthy urban centers and industrial centers. The high death rates in
those places did much to wipe out the surplus births of healthier areas, as
people moved into less healthy urban or industrial centers. So, population
stability for almost a century. </p>
<p>The century after
1650 also saw a new era in price trends and they&#39;re represented on section
three of your handout. As you&#39;ll see from that, the index shows that the
prices of wheat and barley, the principal bread corns, were actually falling
from the 1650s through to about the 1680s and then after a few bad harvests in
the 1690s, they fluctuated at about 20% below the level they had been in the
mid-seventeenth century. In contrast, the prices of meat remained fairly
stable, even rose modestly. </p>
<p>The impact of this,
falling prices for bread corns, stable prices for meat, on the [living] standards
of the common people was quite considerable. The actual wage rates that people
were being paid didn&#39;t change a great deal in the late seventeenth century but
people&#39;s real wages, the purchasing power of their wages, increased quite
substantially for the first time in over a century. So the evidence suggests
that by the 1680s real wages, the purchasing power of wages, were up by about
50% over the levels of the 1630s. For people who could find regular work, the
costs of feeding their families were falling, and that released some purchasing
power for goods over and above those that they needed for basic subsistence. </p>
<p>So then, population
stabilization, declining prices of basic agricultural products, growing real
wages for craftsmen and wage laborers. And to understand the outcome of these
trends we have to remember that all of this is happening in what was already a
more commercialized economy, in which the livelihoods of most people were
increasingly dependent on the markets for their products and their labor in a
more integrated economy. And the outcome of all of this was a further
development in the processes of economic growth which had been set in motion
earlier. One can sum it all up as being a process of increased regional
economic specialization, intensified national economic integration, and also
increasing participation in a nascent world economy. That sounds very grand,
but we can follow through with the processes step by step as to how all of this
fit together. </p>
<p>In agriculture the
key to change was basically the fact that although markets for different
products had stabilized somewhat and reoriented, they didn&#39;t actually decline. The
population stabilized, but it didn&#39;t decline. There was still a large market
for agricultural produce and that placed general pressure on commercial farmers
to try to keep up their market share by reducing their unit costs and competing
with other farmers to produce more, more effectively, at prices which would
enable their profit margins to remain reasonable. And that meant a renewed
emphasis on agricultural improvement. Basically one can say that the late
seventeenth century saw a more general spread of many of the innovations in
agricultural techniques which I described coming in in the late sixteenth and
early seventeenth centuries. It&#39;s been said by one agricultural historian that
many of the novel techniques of a century earlier had become general practice,
general best practice, by the early eighteenth century.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>All of that involved,
and was part and parcel of, a general regional reorientation in land use. Increasingly,
the east and the southeast of the country were predominantly arable. That was
the best price area for cereals. It had major markets in London and the towns
of the southeast and also markets in nearby continental Europe, but elsewhere
in the kingdom livestock husbandry became more prevalent in the north and in
the west. They&#39;d always had a bias towards livestock. It became more marked. One
mustn&#39;t exaggerate all this into complete regional homogeneity, but there was a
definite trend toward specialization of that kind within particular
agricultural countries. And that made easier the diffusion and adoption of
innovations by example. People saw what their neighbors were doing. There is
an excellent account of all of this by one of the writers of the late
seventeenth century, John Aubrey, who describes what was happening in his home
county of Wiltshire down in the southwest, to the southwest of Oxford, and in
Wiltshire Aubrey describes how various innovations were brought in. He names
names; who was the first to do this or to do that, and he describes how their
neighbors copied them when they saw that particular innovations were successful
and profitable. </p>
<p>Overall the whole
process greatly raised agricultural output. It&#39;s been estimated that the
cereals yield in eastern and southeastern England was up by about 40% between
1650 and 1750; an environment then of rising agricultural productivity, induced
by a more competitive commercial climate. </p>
<p>Well, that
agricultural specialization facilitated, and was in turn encouraged by, the
continued growth of the urban population and the continued growth of the
population in the nonagricultural rural areas, the rural areas where many
people were employed in various kinds of industry. And in turn, growing
agricultural productivity released labor for nonagricultural occupations and
enhanced the purchasing power of those who lived by wages in such occupations. </p>
<p>One of the most
striking features of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries is
that although population as a whole stabilized the population of the towns and
the population of the rural industrial areas continued to grow both absolutely
and relatively. There was a regional redistribution of population. Table 4A
shows the figures which have been calculated for this by E.A. Wrigley. As
you&#39;ll see if you look at 4A, rural agricultural population declined from just
over 60% in the 1670s to about 46% by the 1750s. Those living in towns of more
than 5,000 rose from just over 13% to about 21% of the national population and
those living in rural nonagricultural areas rose from about 26 to about 33%
over the same period. </p>
<p>Now a good deal of
that urban growth was of course, as you would expect, occasioned by London, as
usual. By 1700, London had a population of 575,000 and was the biggest city in
Europe. By 1750, its population had reached 675,000. So London continued to
grow in absolute terms, but in fact its share of the national population had
somewhat stabilized at about 11%. What seems to have been happening was that a
great deal of the urban growth of this period was going on in other towns as
well. So, for example, in 1600 England had had twenty towns with a population
of more than 5,000; by 1670 it had twenty-six; by 1700 it had thirty-two. Provincial
cities of more than 5,000 inhabitants were making up an increasing proportion
of the national population, by 1700 probably something like 5.5%. By 1750, it
was closer to 10%. All of this amounted to a kind of re-articulation going on
within the hierarchy of towns and cities. Obviously, London remained at the
top, un-challengeably, but some historic regional centers were stabilizing or
growing only very slowly. The old city of York, for example, remained stable at
about 12,000 population through most of this period. The real growth was going
on in different kinds of towns. It was going on above all in ports, especially
the ports of the west. If you look at table 4B, Bristol, the principal port of
the west of England, grows from about 20,000 population in 1670 to 50,000 by
1750. Liverpool, which was emerging from having been a small market town in
the early seventeenth century, grew from about 5,000 people in 1670 to about 22,000
in 1750. The other kinds of towns which were growing disproportionately seem
to have been industrial centers. Newcastle in the northeast, based on the coal
trade, grew from 12,000 to 29,000 in the period covered by our table; Leeds,
center of the worsted manufacturers in the cloth industry, from 6,000 to 16,000;
Birmingham, center of metalworking, from 6,000 to 24,000. </p>
<p>This shift was
especially pronounced at the turn of the eighteenth century. It&#39;s been shown
that in the early decades of the eighteenth century whereas what have been
described as ten historic centers, old cathedral cities and so forth, grew in
population by only 18%, a sample of eight ports shows 58% growth and a sample
of new manufacturing towns 159% growth. So the urban system was becoming more
polycentric. It had more major centers than it had done and, as will be
apparent from what I&#39;ve already said, the dynamic of growth was in commerce, in
trade, and in industry, taking off in the late seventeenth century and
accelerating in the early eighteenth century. </p>
<p>So, let&#39;s turn to
what was going on there, to commerce, about which you&#39;ve already read a little.
In the 1960s, as a result of the work of Ralph Davis, who was the first
economic historian to really map the trends in trade in this period, people
began to talk of the late seventeenth century as a period of &#39;commercial
revolution&#39;, which is a description which has some justice to it. The focus in
Davis&#39; work was on the major growth of extra-European trade, especially with
the Americas and with the East. Now in considering this it&#39;s important always
to remember that the well-established trades with European countries continued
and indeed in many ways they grew; but the overall pattern of overseas trade
was undoubtedly shifting, as initiatives which had been pioneered by
enterprising people in the early seventeenth century began to pay off, became
consolidated and extended. And there are four major aspects of this change
which are illustrated in different ways on the second side of your handout in
these figures dealing with overseas trade. </p>
<p>The first can be
illustrated if we look at London&#39;s domestic exports in section A of that table.
As it shows, in 1640 in the eve of the Civil War London&#39;s exports were still
dominated by woolen cloth. Some 92% of exports were woolen cloth. By the
later 1660s, though, that was down to 74% and by 1700 it was down to 72%. Now
that change took place not because woolen exports were actually declining, but
because of the rise of other kinds of domestic exports; greater exports of
foodstuffs and of raw materials, agricultural products, fish, lead, tin, coal,
animal hides that had together--all of that together had--made up only five
percent of London&#39;s exports in 1640; it was over 12% by 1700. And then the
export from London of other domestic manufactures; 2.6 percent of London&#39;s
exports in 1640, just over 15% by 1700. So there was a reorientation in the
export trade in domestic products. </p>
<p>Secondly, if we look
at London&#39;s imports, which is section B of the table, that brings out the
continued growth in the value of imports from established European trading
partners; wines from southern Europe as you&#39;ll see growing dramatically in the
value of these imports between the 1630s and the 1690s; silks again, often from
France or southern Europe, rising quite significantly; iron and steel imports
mostly from Scandinavia, from Sweden in particular, rising dramatically from
16,000 to 118,000 pounds in value. So, considerable growth in the imports from
these European trading partners, but that was dwarfed by the imports which were
coming in from the East and the Americas. </p>
<p>Those imports were
increasingly becoming predominant in London&#39;s import trade so we have continued
growth in such commodities as pepper and tobacco, but massive growth in the
import of calicos--that&#39;s cheap cotton cloth from India--and sugar from the
West Indies--almost, well, a fivefold increase in the value of the sugar
imported from the West Indies in the later seventeenth century. </p>
<p>Thirdly, a great deal
of these new imported goods were not consumed domestically but were re-exported
to European markets. So for example two thirds of the tobacco that was landed
in England was re-exported to European markets mostly in northern Europe. A
third of the sugar that was landed was re-exported to Europe. Nine tenths of
the pepper that came in from the East was re-exported. You can look at the
rising value of those re-exports in table 5C. We have the value of domestic
exports, the value of imports and the value of re-exports, and look how it
grows in the course of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. What
was happening then was a flood of tobacco, sugar, calico, other products coming
in from distant overseas origins which was then re-exported, bringing income to
the English merchants who re-exported it to Europe. </p>
<p>One of the
interesting things about all of these products is that they were cheap. A
hogshead of tobacco might be expensive in itself, but by the time it was broken
down in to small parcels, was sold by the pipe, it had a mass market--it was
cheap. Similarly sugar. Sugar might be in the form of a great sugarloaf, but
by the time something had been chipped off it, wrapped up and sold in small
quantities it had a mass market. Calico cloth was very cheap, the kind of
cheap and colorful Indian cotton cloth which we&#39;re still familiar with, which
could be bought by servants. A mass market for these goods, and in fact the
figures that we have here don&#39;t tell us the whole story. It&#39;s well known that
there was a great deal of smuggling and evading the customs. The figures are
based on the customs records. The reality may have been even greater change
than the figures actually represent. </p>
<p>Right. Well, these
new trades were based upon and involved elaborating more complex and
multilateral trading patterns, the fourth feature of the changing trade. These
are often described as the triangular trades. So for example you would get
vessels leaving the western ports of Britain for the fisheries in the north
Atlantic around Newfoundland from which they would bring the dried cod to
southern Europe where it was in great demand and then they would bring southern
European products back to Britain; a triangle. Or ships would leave London usually
heading for the East Indies. They would trade around the East Indies between
the Indian mainland and what&#39;s now Indonesia and then bring products back to
Britain. </p>
<p>The most famous of
these triangles of course is the so-called Atlantic Triangle; the export of
manufactured products, weaponry, and liquor to West Africa, the buying there of
slaves to be taken across to the Caribbean and the southern mainland colonies,
the notorious Atlantic Triangle. That was of course a ghastly trade with
terrible mortality of both the slaves and indeed the English crews on the
&#39;middle passage&#39;, but it was vital to the development of the Atlantic economy
and contemporaries simply seem to have accepted it as such; little comment
initially on what it involved, few voices raised in protest. Slavery in itself
of course was nothing new. What was new was the scale and systematization of
the trade as it developed in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth
centuries. And if it offered any ray of hope in all of this it was simply that
as people became more familiar with its realities voices began to be raised
against it; but not yet. </p>
<p>This transformation
of trade was well established by the 1680s and then it stabilized and continued
to grow steadily right through to the mid-eighteenth century and indeed beyond,
and all of it was vigorously defended by legislation, the Navigation Acts which
made every effort to keep these trades in English hands. Certain goods could
only be exported to the colonies in English ships. Certain goods could only be
landed in England before being re-exported to other destinations; an effort to
keep this new burgeoning trade in the hands of English merchants and in
particular to squeeze out their greatest competitors, the Dutch. </p>
<p>Okay. Well, this expansion
of overseas trade created income obviously; it created employment in shipping
in the commercial infrastructure of the growing port cities; it was directly
linked in that way to urban growth. And above all London of course. Three
quarters of English overseas trade still went through London. Half the
merchant fleet was based in London. London was the dominant center for
shipbuilding and repairing, all the ancillary crafts of the shipping industry.
It was the center for sugar refining and tobacco processing and many other
manufactures linked to trade, silk for example. But increasingly the so-called
&quot;out ports,&quot; the other ports, were getting a bigger share. London&#39;s relative
dominance, especially in the Atlantic and re-export trades, was being whittled
down somewhat. By 1700, about a third of tobacco imports by value and about a
fifth of sugar imports by value came in not through London but through out
ports like Bristol and Liverpool. And after the union between England and
Scotland the city of Glasgow, which became the major British center of the
tobacco trade as the eighteenth century advanced. </p>
<p>The health of trade
was also of immense significance to the development of other industries, both
directly and indirectly. Of course, the trade in woolen textiles, which
remained so important, had always been heavily influenced by overseas markets
for high-quality woolen cloth. That continued to be the case, but the new
trades also established new markets for both traditional and new goods. Prominent
amongst these markets were of course the Americas and the growing colonies
there. In 1686, a survey of London&#39;s exports that year shows that London was
already exporting 598 different commodities to North America, in 329 ships if
you want to know. They were going to Barbados, to Jamaica, to the Chesapeake
colonies, to New England. The total value was prodigious and it involved trade
in textiles, in clothing, in metal wares, in miscellaneous manufactures which
were not produced in the colonies themselves. For example, in 1686 they
exported to the colonies 3,000 wine glasses; they exported 6,000 saddles.<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>These new markets
encouraged bulk manufacture. They encouraged the production of standardized
goods which could be ordered and could be produced by workers who were required
to produce a certain standardized article in the &#39;putting out&#39; industries. So
bulk manufacture of standardized goods was steadily growing, another feature of
industrial change. </p>
<p>So developing markets
for English products were of powerful significance, but much of the output of
manufacturing industries was still consumed at home. As I&#39;ve already
indicated, cheaper food raised real incomes for ordinary people, gave them a
margin above their basic subsistence needs. At least at some point in their
life cycle they had more spending power and that money was often spent on
simple, cheap manufactured goods: calico cloth, linen, domestic utensils and so
forth. Moreover, a lot of the additional income which was being generated in
trade and manufactures themselves, income which went to the mercantile and
commercial classes, the &quot;middle sort of people,&quot; enabled those people to afford
a greater variety of goods which are often described as the &quot;decencies of life&quot;;
not luxuries, not necessities, but the decencies of life, often domestic goods
of one kind or another, or better clothing. </p>
<p>Taken together, the
new overseas markets and the growing domestic markets encouraged the
development of a larger, a stronger and a more flexible industrial base. Take
textiles for example. Woolen cloth manufacture continued as a major industry. There
was a continued diversification of its products, partly for particular overseas
markets. The cloth-weaving villages of the West Country for example produced
most of the trade blankets which went to supply the fur traders in North
America; the wonderful Hudson Bay blankets which you can still buy in Canada. They&#39;re
still made in the west of England. These colorful trade blankets which you see
in portraits of native Americans in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries were already being produced specifically for that market. </p>
<p>In west Yorkshire in
the area around Leeds and Bradford there was a great growth in another
dimension of the woolen cloth industry, the production of worsted cloth. It
was aimed at the cheaper end of the market, mostly domestic. In Lancashire,
around Manchester, there were further significant new developments, Manchester
lying just to the east of Liverpool. In that area the linen manufacturing
industry became concentrated in the late seventeenth century, producing not
only linen for domestic needs but also producing sailcloth for the growing
merchant fleet and canvas. The Manchester area gradually shifted over from
linen to the development of cotton manufacturing. They were imitating the
imported cotton cloth from India, trying to produce it at home. By 1700, a
million pounds a year&#39;s worth of raw cotton was being imported, much of it via
Liverpool, to supply that growing industry. The cotton at this stage tended to
come from the Mediterranean rather than North America. By the 1740s two
million pounds a year worth of raw cotton for Manchester&#39;s looms. The finished
cotton cloth had a big market at home and it was also exported to West Africa
and to the Americas. So by 1750 the Manchester area, when a survey was done,
had almost 5,000 looms working producing cotton. </p>
<p>That was an important
precursor of things that were to come in the cotton industry of Lancashire, but
as yet many of the really significant developments were outside textiles. The
pottery industry was taking off in the west Midlands in Staffordshire to the
north of Birmingham. First of all, it concentrated on the production of coarse
earthenware and on so-called &#39;Delftware&#39;, which was in imitation of the Delft
pottery produced in the Netherlands. Production of that kind of pottery
doubled in the late seventeenth century. Then they moved on to stoneware
particularly after the 1680s, and as the potteries expanded employment in this
industry trebled. This was the age which saw the foundation just a decade or
two later of such firms that are still familiar as Wedgwood and Royal Doulton
in that area of the potteries; the west Midlands. </p>
<p>Metal wares were also
taking off. The city of Sheffield in south Yorkshire had long been involved in
the production of edge tools but they began to diversify. They began to
produce scissors and files and metal buttons and razors and forks. Forks were
a novelty. Prior to this period people ate their meat by stabbing it with a
pointed knife and putting it in their mouths. Forks were coming in, Sheffield
was manufacturing them for this new market. They were amongst the &#39;decencies&#39;
of life. In the west Midlands there was comparable growth around Birmingham
especially from the 1690s. Birmingham had long made nails and tools and
weaponry and saddlers&#39; ironmongery, but they began to make fancy buckles and
buttons and pots and pans and kettles and what they described as &quot;toys.&quot; Toys
were steel jewelry often made with wire twisted in elaborate ways. They began
specializing also in the production of boxes which imitated Japanese imports;
it was known as &#39;Japanning&#39;, the production of lacquered boxes in imitation of
these popular products which had been introduced by the trade with the East. In
this version they were affordable by people of the middling sort, not simply by
the elite. They also had big markets in guns, many of which were exported to
North America and to Africa, and they supplied the planters of the American
colonies with cast nails, with holes, with sugar cane knives, with chains for
their oxen to pull heavy weights and so forth. And so one could go on for
other less dramatic developments in regional industrial specialization and
growth. </p>
<p>And finally, all of
this required of course raw materials. Some of those raw materials were being
imported, another stimulus to trade; the cotton from the Mediterranean, the
steel from Sweden, some specialized high-quality wools which were used in the
woolen manufactures--they came from Spain, some of them. But a great deal of
the raw materials used were being produced at home. The period saw a major
expansion in the iron and steel industries from the 1670s. Tin mining down in
the southwest in Cornwall took off; copper mining expanded; lead mining in
Derbyshire in the Midlands, here, and in north Wales also increased very
significantly. And there was a massive growth in the coal industry, coal being
the ubiquitous fuel not only for domestic fires but for any industrial process
which required heat. They still couldn&#39;t use it for smelting iron, but they
used it in many other industrial processes which simply required a source of
heat. So coal production in Newcastle in the northeast, which had already been
a prodigious half a million tons in 1650, was 1.3 million by 1700 and over two
million by 1750, and there were significant expansions of coal production in
other areas too. Areas where it hadn&#39;t been previously economical to produce
and transport coal now got involved because demand had increased. </p>
<p>The coal industry
bred other innovations. Steam engines were invented at the end of the
seventeenth century to drain coal mines; that was their original purpose. Wooden
wagon ways, railways built of wood along which wagons would run to transport
coal more cheaply and easily, wagons pulled by horses, were introduced from the
1660s and were commonplace in the coal mining areas by the early eighteenth
century. One proud coal owner said that one of his wagon ways which he&#39;d built
for several miles to get his coal to market was as prodigious an engineering
feat as the Via Appia near Rome, and he was right. Some of these industrial
undertakings were the biggest civil engineering projects which had been
undertaken in Britain since the Romans had left. Eventually, of course, you
put together the steam engines that drained the mines with the railways, the
wagon ways that carried the coal, and you have locomotives; George Stephenson. </p>
<p>So, in the areas of
growth of this kind, especially as you have noticed, areas in the north and in
the Midlands and in parts of the West Country, the picture is one of what&#39;s
been described as industrial &#39;agglomeration&#39;; a greater density of involvement
in particular areas. And that kind of agglomeration as more and more
communities are involved in these activities had many effects. It could reduce
transportation costs. It could encourage spin-off developments. It could
encourage the spread of innovations; the transmission of skills amongst the
local population well used to its involvement in these industries; the
formation of partnerships to raise capital; flows of information regarding
markets and innovative products and processes. It resulted eventually in the
creation of highly specialized local economies, distinctive occupational
regions: the coal mining areas of the northeast, the cloth weaving areas of the
West Country, the metal ware areas of Birmingham and so forth. These were
essentially the origins of the distinctive regional identities of industrial
Britain as it was to be. The roots of some of this activity of course lay deep
in the past, especially the cloth industry, but the period between 1660 and the
mid-eighteenth century saw the full emergence of all of this activity as part
of a new regional economic structure. </p>
<p>Now of course every
one of those zones was centered upon a major town or towns, another part of the
story of urban growth, and the interconnections between them were facilitated
by the role of towns as central places in the circulating systems of commerce. The
late seventeenth and very early eighteenth centuries saw a second great wave of
intensification in internal trade, comparable to but exceeding that which had
taken place in the late sixteenth century. Trade in both agricultural and
industrial products. It was a great age of improvement in communications as
well as in agriculture and manufactures. Without improvement in communications
this kind of regional specialization wouldn&#39;t have been possible. You had to
be able to move the goods around effectively. The coastal trade grew
enormously. It&#39;s been said that the long coastline of Britain became like one
great river with coastal traffic flowing to and fro. Efforts were made also to
improve the navigation of the great river systems, the Thames, the Severn, the
Trent and so forth. There were over forty acts of Parliament for river
navigation improvement schemes passed between 1660 and 1700. Efforts were also
made to improve the roads. Turnpike trusts were devised as a way of improving
road quality by charging a toll, the money from which would be used to maintain
a higher quality highway. All of the major routes in the county of
Gloucestershire, just around Bristol, were turnpiked between 1690 and 1740, to
take just one regional example. Every major route there had been turnpiked and
proliferating turnpiking was taking place all over the kingdom, radiating out,
in particular, from London. Along those improved roads were improved regular
carrier services delivering goods to and fro throughout the kingdom. So in a
sense it was an age of intensified traffic on all these arteries of
communication, by river, around the coast, along the turnpike roads. </p>
<p>And that inevitably
produced an intensifying relationship of exchange between urban and rural
society, between different rural regions; the influence of all of this activity
percolating right down to the level of the individual village. One indicator
of that, to close, is the proliferation of village shops in this period. It&#39;s
a period which sees a proliferation of little shops in villages. For example,
in a far from prominent place up here in the Lake District in the northwest,
the town of Kirkby Lonsdale, there was a man called Abraham Dent who kept a
shop at the turn of the eighteenth century. His inventory survives. It lists
all the goods that he stocked and the suppliers to whom he owed money; very
useful. Abraham Dent stocked goods from fifty-one different origins, some of
them way overseas. He had his tobacco, he had his sugar and so forth, and many
English manufactured products. He had bought goods from one hundred and ninety
different suppliers scattered all over the country and they&#39;d reached him in
his obscure town in the Lake District. </p>
<p>Such local tradesmen
as Abraham Dent showed how far England&#39;s local economies had moved away from
the era of relative self-sufficiency which I described at the beginning of this
lecture course, and the existence of shops like Dent&#39;s symbolize, in a sense,
the completion of a massive process of commercial integration and transition. John
Brewer puts it very well when he says &quot;the shopkeeper linked the market town
and the local community to a network of markets that now stretched beyond the
nation&#39;s boundaries, across oceans, across continents&quot;; and that&#39;s correct. They
linked together the farmers, the craftspeople, the merchants, the seamen, the
hunters, the plantation slaves, all linked together in an increasingly closely
articulated whole; a market economy, a nascent world economy. Some people
describe all this as &quot;archaic globalization,&quot; some of the earlier stages of
that familiar process. It&#39;s a commercial civilization in which Britain
increasingly played a core role. </p>
<p>It was still, as E.A.
Wrigley has put it, an &quot;organic economy.&quot; It still depended pretty much on
muscle power, human and animal muscles, or wind and water to power its
machinery and so forth. It was not yet what he describes as the &quot;mineral-based
energy economy&quot; of the Industrial Revolution era. But if it was still an
organic economy it was a very advanced organic economy, and already in many
ways beginning to anticipate the transformations which would come in the later
eighteenth century with the introduction of steam power and mechanization.<sup>3</sup>

<p>So we&#39;ll leave it
there. </p>
<p>Well, have a good
break and we&#39;ll reassemble to get the end of the story as far as the state is
concerned in the week after Thanksgiving. </p>
