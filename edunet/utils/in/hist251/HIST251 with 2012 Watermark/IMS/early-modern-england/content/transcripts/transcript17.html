<p><b>Professor Keith Wrightson:
</b>Right.
Well, today I want to talk about changes in education and the growth of
popular literacy in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, one of the
most important sets of changes which were going on in the reign of Elizabeth
and the--under the early Stuarts. </p>
<p>Okay. To begin with
a little context, looking back at the late medieval period, it&#39;s been said of
late medieval England that at that time all education was technical and
vocational, directed to some particular occupation or function. And the formal
schooling that we tend to think of when we use the term &quot;education&quot; was really
only part of that. If one thinks of education more broadly in terms of the
transmission of a culture and its skills and values and so on, then of course
that was a much larger thing than simply formal schooling and it involved not
only schools but the church, the household; many ways in which people were
instructed for their roles in life. </p>
<p>So, one can&#39;t say
that medieval England was in any way an uneducated society. It was educated
insofar as it needed certain kinds of training, but it was a relatively
unschooled society. Very few children attended any kind of formal school,
probably less than 10% in the late fifteenth century. Formal schooling was
reserved, then, for specific occupations at that time: clergymen, those who
were going to be lawyers, some merchants who might need skills of reading and
writing or even foreign languages, some craftsmen and so on. It was certainly
not simply a clerical monopoly as sometimes people think. Nonetheless, it was
restricted in its scope and tailored to quite specific occupational needs. </p>
<p>Now at the turn of
the sixteenth century, that situation began to change, and by the late
sixteenth century it was changing very rapidly. A new enthusiasm emerged in
this period for formal schooling at all levels. Why should that be so? Well,
there seemed to have been two main cultural influences on that development
affecting different parts of society. </p>
<p>First of all, there
was the influence of renaissance humanism, affecting mainly the social elite. When
we speak of humanism in the sixteenth century we mean not the rationalist,
secular system of morality that one thinks of today when using that term. Rather
the term is used to describe what people at the time referred to as the &quot;new
learning,&quot; the new learning, which had emerged in the fifteenth century and was
sweeping all before it in the early sixteenth century, championed by scholars
like Erasmus of Rotterdam or in England John Colet, the Dean of St. Paul&#39;s
Cathedral, or Sir Thomas More. In educational terms, humanism essentially
involved the study of ancient languages: Latin certainly, increasingly Greek,
occasionally also Hebrew, and the philosophy, the literature, and the history
produced by the writers of classical antiquity. So it&#39;s a process of
recovering more fully the works of classical antiquity and making them more
available to a larger audience, and all of this was for a purpose. </p>
<p>It was believed by
humanist scholars that classical education, combined with Christian morality,
would be a way of reviving virtue in public life and creating order and harmony
in the commonwealth; it would be a way of training virtuous princes and dutiful
subjects. That was essentially the humanist ideal. In a way they were trying
to get back to the notion of an educated aristocracy, which had certainly been
the case in the Roman Empire. The aristocracy of late medieval England, of
course, was largely a military one. But they wanted them to be scholars too, just
as the great figures of classical antiquity had been. And this was to prove a
profoundly influential ideal. It was transmitted to the English elite probably
via the court and also by a number of influential books which were widely read
amongst them. One of them was a translation of an Italian work, Castiglione&#39;s
book, <i>The Courtier, </i>originally written in the 1520s and published in
England in 1561. Another--these titles are on your handout--another was a book
by Sir Thomas Elyot, who was a member of Henry VIII&#39;s secretariat. In 1537 he
published a book called <i>The Governor, The Book Named</i> <i>The Governor, </i>which
proved to be a great popularizer of humanist educational ideals. Elyot for
example laid down a model of the ideal education which suggested that children
should be taught Latin by the age of seven, between seven and fourteen they
would read Latin classics and begin to learn Greek, between fourteen and seventeen
they would be trained in logic, in rhetoric, in history, and in poetry, between
seventeen and twenty-one they would move on to philosophy and ethics,
particularly the works of Plato, which were particularly valued by the
humanists, and at the age of twenty-one they would begin studying law. And
meanwhile they would also have physical training: horsemanship, sports, the
military arts and dancing. Dancing was considered very important. It taught
grace and poise and they considered that to be an important accomplishment. Well,
this is a demanding model of education which seems quite ridiculously
demanding; at least I used to think so until I first read the Yale
distributional requirements. So in a sense we are in the tradition. </p>
<p>A third work which
was very influential was written by Roger Ascham, another man close to the
court, in 1570. It was in fact inspired by a dinner table conversation about
education which he had with William Cecil, Elizabeth&#39;s principal secretary, and
Ascham put it down in writing in <i>The Schoolmaster, </i>published in 1570. He
described it as being &quot;specially purposed for the private bringing up of youth
in gentlemen&#39;s and noblemen&#39;s houses,&quot; focusing on classical learning and sound
religion. </p>
<p>Okay. So renaissance
humanism was one model aimed in particular at the social elite. A second
cultural influence of great importance was of course the Protestant
Reformation. The notion that learning and sound religion should go together
was present from the beginning, of course, but the triumph of Protestantism in
the reformation gave an even greater edge to the advocacy of education for two
reasons. First of all, they wanted to educate the clergy better, to provide a
better educated clergy who would be not only administrators of the sacraments
but a teaching pastorate; theologically aware preachers and catechizers,
educators of the people in the new church. </p>
<p>Secondly, they also
believed that education was a vital aid to the salvation of the common people. Protestantism
after all was very much a religion of the book, and in their view full
appreciation of God&#39;s will required the ability to read it in the scriptures;
or ideally. Hence, there was an emphasis on schooling and on basic literacy
for essentially religious purposes, and that in a sense extends the educational
drive of the period beyond the social elite to the population at large. This
is an educational ideal of much broader social relevance. </p>
<p>So, the educational
imperative then involved two ideological,or cultural elements, humanist ideals
of virtuous rulers, Protestant ideals of a godly pastorate and a godly people
of more universal relevance. Both promoted formal education as a means of
social and cultural change, and that&#39;s an altogether new significance for the
institutions of schooling; they envisage social and cultural change as a
result. And meanwhile of course, as background to all of this, there was the
process of economic expansion, which I&#39;ve already described, enhancing in
various ways the desirability of basic schooling for various commercial
purposes. </p>
<p>So what was the
response? One response was the gradual transformation of the education of the
social elite, the upper gentry in particular and the aristocracy. The
sixteenth century essentially saw the transition from a pattern of people being
educated in great noble households by tutors or household chaplains to an ideal
in which people first of all attended schools, grammar schools in particular,
and then moved on to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the ancient
universities. And then sometimes also to the Inns of Court in London, which
were very much like Oxford or Cambridge colleges, but devoted to the study of
the law, sometimes referred to as England&#39;s third university though they were
essentially a separate set of institutions. </p>
<p>Well, the
universities and the Inns of Court got this role in elite education pretty much
by default. In the 1530s, various humanist advisers on education still thought
of the universities as primarily a place for training clergymen. They wanted
the foundation of a new academy for the social elite which should ideally be
located near the capital, but such schemes came to nothing, and by the mid-sixteenth
century members of the social elite were beginning to follow earlier precedents
of some of their number by attending the universities and sometimes going on to
the Inns of Court. By the late sixteenth century, that trickle of gentlemen
and noblemen into the universities and the Inns had become a stream and soon it
was something of a flood. Many of the buildings in Oxford and Cambridge
colleges which survive to this day were actually erected at this time to expand
the provision for these larger numbers of students, and indeed a number of new
colleges were founded in this period for the same reason. </p>
<p>There was a massive
expansion in the numbers of students at both the universities and the Inns. In
fact, by the early seventeenth century the numbers of students in these institutions
was at the highest that it was to be again before the nineteenth century. It
faded a little in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and then rose
again later on. All of this meant a very significant change in the social
composition of Oxford and Cambridge colleges and, if you look at your handout,
the set of tables that are there, you&#39;ll see in table one the social
composition of a number of Cambridge colleges. These are the undergraduates,
and you&#39;ll see that by the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, to
which these figures refer, the college of Emmanuel College had 63% of its
students of gentry birth. King&#39;s College had 58% of gentry birth, and Jesus and
St. John&#39;s just less than 50%. This was the general trend and it was pretty
much the same story at Oxford. </p>
<p>Well, the
universities had to adapt to educating these new types of students and a new
pattern soon emerged. Many of these gentry students lived in their colleges as
what were known as &quot;fellow commoners.&quot; They ate with the master and fellows of
the college on the high table rather than down in the body of the hall with
more &#39;plebian&#39; students. They were also very rarely involved in actually
taking a degree. Most of them pursued their studies privately with tutors who
were appointed by their parents within particular colleges to oversee their
education and to look after their moral welfare and they were paid directly by
the parents to do this. It&#39;s the origins of the Oxford and Cambridge tutorial
system. At this time in fact many of these students even slept in their
tutors&#39; rooms. There would be a number of little--&quot;truckle beds&quot; they were
called--that could be pushed in to the wall and pulled out at night, where
these students would sleep with their master, their tutor, in his room next
door. </p>
<p>Instead of the usual
formal course of the university, which included rhetoric and logic and
philosophy leading to the bachelor&#39;s degree, tutors usually devised for their
students more modern courses. They included subjects like history and
literature, geography, modern divinity, and modern philosophy. Some of them
prepared special reading lists for their students. Some of them even prepared
for their students &#39;digests&#39; of key quotations, sort of sixteenth-century
handouts you could say; key quotes from the classics that you could drop in to
your conversation, and they would help their students memorize them in that
way. </p>
<p>We have an account of
education at Cambridge in the early seventeenth century from a student called Simonds
d&#39;Ewes who kept a diary. His name is there on your handout. Between 1617 and
1619, Simonds d&#39;Ewes was a student at St. John&#39;s College in Cambridge and
there, we learn, he studied logic and ethics and moral philosophy and history
with his tutor, Richard Holdsworth, who was a well-known Puritan divine. He
also went to a few of the university lectures though not terribly many. He
practiced his letter style in English and in Latin. It was very important to
learn to write a letter well. He went to sermons in the churches of the city,
and he discussed modern theology with his tutor, and he kept a theological
commonplace book. He was being trained in Calvinist theology, and he rounded
the whole thing off with what he described as &quot;my often conversing with
learned men of other colleges and the prime young students of mine own.&quot; </p>
<p>Now all of this was
in accordance with the desires of gentry parents to have an education which was
suitable for a learned and polished gentleman of the renaissance ideal. Richard
Holdsworth, d&#39;Ewes tutor, put it well in a letter describing one of his
students. He was recruiting someone else to tutor the boy and he described the
boy&#39;s father&#39;s desires as follows: &quot;His father means not to have him a
scholar by profession but only to be seasoned with the varnish of learning and
piety.&quot; And that pretty much sums up what they were aiming at. &quot;His
father means him not to have him a scholar by profession&quot;--God forbid -- &quot;but
only to be seasoned with the varnish of learning and piety.&quot;</p>
<p>The Inns of Court,
down in London, adapted far less to the needs of new students. Students got no
special help. There was no tutorial system. They simply had to read law
books, to attend the courts to see how it was done, to attend formal exercises
in the Inns where they would plead cases, sort of mock hearings. English
common law at this time was considered quite appallingly difficult. It hadn&#39;t
really been systematized at all. It&#39;s been described by one legal historian as
&quot;a formless, confused jumble of undigested particulars successfully resisting
all efforts at simplification or systematic statement.&quot; You just had to learn
it all. Students who tried to do so seriously found it quite awful. In fact, Simonds
d&#39;Ewes, who went down for a further two years at the Inns of Court after he
finished at Cambridge, described his two years at the Inns of Court as
&quot;amongst the unhappiest days of my life.&quot; Those of you planning
legal careers, bear this in mind. </p>
<p>The historian of the
Inns of Court, Wilfrid Prest, reckons that the average gentleman attending the Inns
probably didn&#39;t learn all that much of the law. Nevertheless, the Inns were
considered very important as sort of finishing schools in a sense, centers for
all kinds of informal learning. After all, they were located in London, just
in between the city of London and the royal capital of Westminster, where the
courts met, and they exposed students to all the things which were available in
the metropolis. They attended plays. They went to sermons at the churches of
the city. They hung out in the taverns and so forth. One student who came
from Dorset, down in the southwest, a man with the wonderful name William Freke,
who attended the Inns of Court in the early 1620s, has left behind a list of
the books he bought during his years in London at the Inns and it&#39;s very
interesting. He bought many religious works, many devotional books, but he
also bought books on physiognomy, on arithmetic, on travel. He bought history
books, he bought popular romances, and he was interested in drama. He owned a
copy--an early copy--of Shakespeare&#39;s <i>Othello</i>. But amongst all the books
he bought while he was in London he only bought one law book,
[laughter] and significantly it was a classic, Littleton on tenures<i>,
</i>the classic outline of land tenure law, which was very much the kind of
thing a gentleman like William Freke would need to know when he returned to his
family&#39;s estates. </p>
<p>Now of course not all
of the gentry did all of this, but nonetheless many of them did some of it, and
it led to a significant transformation of the educational experience of the
social elite. To give some figures on that: in 1563, of the members of
Parliament in that year only 26% had attended university, by 1642 50% had
attended university. Or, even better, if one looks at the justices of the peace
serving in six counties, in 1562 only 5% of them had attended a university. By
1636, in the same six counties it was 62%. So a real transformation in the
educational experience of these vital members of the political nation. </p>
<p>Right. Well a second
consequence of these changes was a transformation in the educational level of
the English clergy. Don&#39;t forget that the universities still remained the
major centers for training clergymen. Around 50% of university students were
still non-members of the gentry, and most of them actually came from clerical
families or so-called &#39;plebian&#39; families, i.e., non gentlemen, and frequently
they were intending clerical careers. They tended to do the full-scale traditional
university course leading to a bachelor&#39;s degree and perhaps to a master&#39;s
degree. And their numbers were rising also, and the rising numbers of these
clerical recruits produced a general transformation in the educational levels
of the parish clergy. By the 1630s, after two generations of this, a largely
graduate clergy was established in much of England. There are some figures on
your handout from the diocese of Worcester, a large diocese in the west
Midlands. In the diocese of Worcester in 1580, only 23% of the clergy were
graduates, by 1640 it was 84%, and that was pretty much the same story as could
be found in other dioceses at this time. So, a second effect is the
transformation of the educational level of the clergy. </p>
<p>A third response was
the general proliferation of schooling opportunities for the common people. The
sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries were a great age of school
foundation. There were many, many new foundations. Notable amongst them were
the founding of endowed grammar schools. Many of the principal schools in
English cities carry the name King Edward VI School, or some other name linking
them to this period of major educational expansion and founding of grammar
schools in the mid-to- late sixteenth century. They were often founded with
money donated by merchants, by leading members of the clergy, by members of the
gentry from particular areas, and the motivation was often a mixture of
religious zeal and regional patriotism. For example, in the county of Lancashire,
up in the northwest here, in 1480 there were only three endowed schools; by
1540 there were twelve; by 1600 there were twenty-eight; by 1640 there were fifty
endowed grammar schools. Indeed, by that date every major town and some
relatively insignificant ones in that county had a grammar school. Two thirds
of the money that was donated for school foundation in Lancashire came from
London, came from merchants and lawyers and others of Lancashire origin who,
usually at their death, left part of the money they&#39;d made to found a school
back in their home county to help boys like themselves to get a start. That&#39;s
the regional patriotism element in what was going on. </p>
<p>Usually, the endowed
grammar schools offered a variety of types of schooling. The education which
they offered was in part classical education as the &#39;grammar&#39; school name
implies, preparing people for the universities, but usually they also catered
for the needs of others also. They had what was described as the &#39;vernacular
side&#39; where the teaching was mostly in English, and they often had a &#39;petty
section&#39; as it was called, a petty section which would focus on the &#39;three R&#39;s&#39;:
reading, writing, and &#39;rithmetic or--well, four R&#39;s really--reading, writing,
&#39;rithmetic and religion. </p>
<p>In addition to the
endowed grammar schools there were the schools which were known as &#39;petty
schools&#39;. These were not usually endowed foundations. They sprang up and died
away according to whether or not there was a particular schoolmaster who opened
them and ran them for a while, but they became increasingly common all over the
kingdom. Petty schools taught basic literacy often accompanied by a little bit
of arithmetic. By the early seventeenth century, most country towns in England
had a grammar school and several petty schools, and in addition petty schools
were increasingly common in many villages. It&#39;s not unusual for them to be
kept by local clergymen, very often the teaching taking place in the church
porch, weather permitting. </p>
<p>All in all then we
have a transformation of elite education, we have a transformation of clerical
education, and a vast increase in the schooling available to the common people
of town and country. All of this was a very considerable achievement. But at
the same time it&#39;s important to grasp that there were some limits to it. Historians
have spoken of an &quot;educational revolution&quot; taking place in this period and I
think that is in many ways justified, but it also inevitably had its limits. And
those limits were most clear when one looks at the differences of social rank
and gender, as one might expect. </p>
<p>If the period saw a
real expansion of educational opportunity, access to it was almost inevitably
socially circumscribed. The Inns of Court were very much elite institutions. 90%
of the students were of gentry origin. The universities, as we&#39;ve seen, were
also dominated by the gentry and the 50% or so of students who were of plebeian
birth were not drawn from the poor. Plebeian just meant non-gentry. They were
usually the sons of clergymen, of merchants, the urban elite, professional
people, and so forth. And the reasons for this are obvious enough. That kind
of education was very costly. Children from relatively humble families could
sometimes make it to the university if they had a patron who would help them,
pay some of the fees for them. Sometimes talented children were spotted by a
local clergyman or a gentleman who would help them on their way, find them a
scholarship. It was also possible to work your way through by acting as a
servant for the gentry students. Students who did that were known as servitors
or sizars. Interestingly, a study done of them shows that servitors and sizars
working their way through almost invariably graduated, whereas the gentlemen
they served of course very rarely did. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, it&#39;s
obviously the case that university education and education at the Inns of Court
was heavily monopolized by the upper reaches of society. The same was true to
a lesser extent in the grammar schools. The sons of the gentry might attend, most
of the other students were the children of the clergy and the professional and
craftspeople of the towns, with a few sons of yeoman farmers from the
countryside attending. The problems inhibiting the attendance of children at
these schools was first of all the costs, fees, boarding in the town where the
school was, but also, perhaps even more importantly, perceived need. This kind
of grammar school education was regarded as appropriate only for people who
would be going on to enter the professions or trade at a fairly high level. It
wasn&#39;t deemed appropriate for farmers&#39; sons to get that level of education. </p>
<p>When one gets to the
petty schools, they were much more open and the evidence suggests a much wider
intake in local society. Nevertheless, there were still inhibitions. Fees
still needed to be paid, even if they were small. You had to supply your own
books and paper and pens and some families couldn&#39;t afford this kind of thing. There
was also the problem of conflict with the labor needs of farm families. Children
were often put to school at the age of five or six but taken away at the age of
seven when they were able to play a more productive role in the family economy.
So sometimes their working lives had begun before they&#39;d had the opportunity to
gain much learning. One seventeenth-century autobiographer described how his
brothers attended school in some of the winter months, but were busy on the
farm for most of the rest of the year and, as he said, what they learned when
they attended school they soon forgot. He was kept at school by his father
constantly because his father intended to put him into trade and so he gained a
pretty sound education. </p>
<p>Well, the relative
failure of the mass of the population to participate beyond the level of the
petty school, if that, is fairly strikingly brought out when we look at the
available figures that historians have put together on the subject of levels of
literacy. You might well ask, how on earth can we measure literacy in such a
distant period of the past? Well, the usual way of doing that is to get large
samples of people putting their names to documents and to distinguish between
those who could write their names, who could sign their names, and those who
simply made a mark. If you look at the illustration on your handout, that&#39;s a
petition signed by a lot of people whose names are there at the bottom, and
you&#39;ll see for example on the left-hand side a scribe has written in the names
followed by &quot;his mark,&quot; and on the left of that you have the marks of the
various people concerned. On the other side of the sheet, there a number of
examples of people who had successfully signed their names. </p>
<p>So it&#39;s possible to
get large samples of evidence of whether people could or could not sign their
names. One might be skeptical about how meaningful that is. After all, one
could learn to sign one&#39;s name even if one was in other ways scarcely literate.
But that was very unlikely in this period. To be unable to sign your name was
not a great social embarrassment for most members of the population. It wasn&#39;t
something they would need to try to avoid, and again the schooling practice of
the time was that children only began to learn to write once they&#39;d become
proficient readers. So if you got--if you had proceeded with writing far along
enough to be able to handle a quill pen well enough to sign your name the
likelihood is that you were a proficient reader. Now this may leave out of the
count some people who perhaps could read reasonably, but had not learned to
write, and indeed if you look at the bottom of that petition you&#39;ll notice one
man&#39;s mark which is clearly an initial letter; it&#39;s clearly an &quot;R.&quot; He was
called Richard. One wonders whether Richard could in fact read and could
handle a pen well enough to make the initial letter of his name. But
historians who do this kind of work are very strict. Either you sign your name
or you don&#39;t. They know that these figures are not perfect but it&#39;s a clear
differentiation and we can compare different areas and different social groups.
So that&#39;s how they do it. </p>
<p>What are the
results? Well, in the year 1642 massive numbers of people were required to put
their name to the so-called Protestation Oath at the beginning of the English civil
wars. Studying the returns of the Protestation Oath which survive, David
Cressy found that something like 70% of the adult men who signed that document
were unable to sign their names. 30% signed, 70% made their mark. But he also
found that it varied enormously from place to place. Some places were 90%
literate, some places were less than 50% literate, and he also found that towns
were very much more literate than villages. That gives us the broad picture of
what had emerged by the mid-seventeenth century. </p>
<p>Other studies have
looked at the literacy of different social groups in particular areas of the
country, and some of the figures they&#39;ve produced are there in tables two and
three on your handout. They tend to bring out vividly how there&#39;s a hierarchy
of literacy and illiteracy. These figures are giving the percentages of people
who made their mark, who couldn&#39;t sign their name. Table two is a rural area
of Essex and Hertfordshire, to the east of London. Table three is the city of
London and the county of Middlesex, which was urbanized, so that&#39;s an urban
sample. There&#39;s a hierarchy in both countryside and town as you move down the
social scale; yeomen in the countryside, only 33% can&#39;t sign, if one moves down
to laborers in the countryside 100% can&#39;t sign. But look at the differences
between town and country. Tradesmen and craftsmen in the rural sample, 42%
can&#39;t sign, so more than half can; but if one moves to the city only 28% can&#39;t
sign, much higher levels of ability to sign. Even laborers in the city were
only 78% illiterate, so some laboring men in the city could sign their names. </p>
<p>What this indicates
in general, studies of this kind, is that, in the course of the later sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, illiteracy amongst the social elite was completely
wiped out; it was just eradicated. Amongst the middling kind of people, yeoman
farmers, tradesmen and craftsmen, illiteracy was drastically reduced. Many of
these people can read and write by the early seventeenth century. If you move
further down the social scale, amongst husbandmen and laborers there&#39;s much
less change. Nonetheless, some of these people also were beginning to be able
to read and write. It&#39;s not surprising that there&#39;s a hierarchy of illiteracy
in a society structured as this one was. One could say that the hierarchy of
illiteracy faithfully mirrors the social order. Nonetheless, significant
inroads have been made even low in the social scale. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s turn now to
another form of differentiation, not between social rank but between gender. The
education of girls was of course also influenced by their social rank, but at
all social levels there was a major problem of the perceived need to educate
women. Amongst the gentry, by the late sixteenth century it was already widely
accepted that gentlewomen should be taught to read and write, to sing, to play
instruments, to dance, to sew, perhaps even acquire a little knowledge of
French. And this education would be conducted privately. They weren&#39;t usually
sent to school, which was considered too risky to their virtue. They would be
educated at home by their mothers, by governesses, by the lady of the household
if they were in honorable service in a great household, perhaps by the domestic
chaplain of such a household. </p>
<p>In the early
seventeenth century, there was a little change with the founding of some girls&#39;
boarding schools, usually in the London area, but they were few and extremely
expensive. So the kind of education that gentlewomen were getting was
restricted in its scope though there are a number of rare examples of
individual girls who got a much fuller education including classical learning. One
example is Lucy Hutchinson, a young woman who tells us in the memoir she wrote--of
her husband&#39;s career--tells us that her father believed that there was no
reason why a young woman should not receive the same education as young men. So
there were people who had views of that kind even at this time, though it was
comparatively rare. </p>
<p>Girls of lower social
rank got most of their education for life either from their mothers or as
servants in the tasks of housewifery. A few of them attended school, though
very few. They might attend a petty school if their parents wished, but there
was absolutely no question of them going to a grammar school or acquiring
classical education. The universities, of course, were closed to women. The
general lack of perceived need for girls&#39; schooling is shown in the invariably
high illiteracy figures for women. If you look at the figures on the handout
again, you&#39;ll see that in the rural area women were 95% unable to sign and in
the city 76%. These figures may possibly exaggerate female illiteracy, because
it was women above all who were most likely to be taught to read but not to
write; taught to read for religious reasons but it wasn&#39;t considered necessary
to teach them to write, so the figures for women may be exaggerated. Nonetheless,
overall, girls of the &#39;middling sort&#39; might stand a chance of learning to read
and possibly to write, but below that level there was almost total exclusion. </p>
<p>Well, to draw towards
a conclusion, what was the overall significance of all of this educational
change? Well, with all reservations, I think these developments are very
significant indeed. The transformation of the education of the social elite
was arguably a very significant step towards the growth of a homogeneous
national culture amongst the ruling class, created by a highly standardized
pattern of education in which many of them, if not most of them, participated. These
were people who were still very much at home in their country, their province. They
frequently spoke still with strong regional accents--Sir Walter Raleigh was
said to have a particularly strong west country accent, which was noted at the
court--but also these people were experiencing the assimilation and the
capacity to manipulate a generalized system of cultural standards and values
conveyed to them through the classical learning they were acquiring. And when
one reads their letters, on paper they&#39;re remarkably homogeneous. There&#39;s a
common range of reference that they allude to--pointed out in one recent study
of a pamphlet written by a country magistrate on the subject of witchcraft;
the classical allusions which he casually throws out and the biblical
references which he casually throws out in the course of the pamphlet. He
simply assumes that his readers amongst fellow magistrates will know what he&#39;s
talking about. They belong to a common cultural world based on the classics,
the Bible, certain forms of Protestant theology and law. </p>
<p>Again the
transformation of the education at the level of the clergy is surely very
significant. Most parishes by 1640 had what you could reasonably call a kind
of resident intellectual. It&#39;s a development full of potential implications
for the penetration of the countryside by the cultural values of the
university, through the contacts between these clergymen and those whom they
served in their parishes. </p>
<p>Lower on the social
scale the achievement may seem much more limited, but I think one should think
about it positively. A certain threshold had been crossed. In every parish
there were at least some of the common people, certainly those of middle rank
and some of those even below that, who could read, who could write. Literacy
was now something that people would encounter much more frequently in many
contexts of life, something they would use for many purposes. </p>
<p>To give perhaps a
silly example, I once worked on a village in the north of England, up near
Newcastle on Tyne, where, in the late sixteenth century, every will surviving
for that village was written by the local clergyman; he was the only one who
could do it. The records of the village even reveal that on one occasion a man
who was dying, who hadn&#39;t made his will, sent urgently for the clergyman and
they couldn&#39;t find him because he&#39;d gone fishing. A little girl was sent
running down the river to find him and bring him back. He came back too late. The
man had died--with his dying breath he had told what he wanted his goods--how
he wanted his goods--to be distributed; and we know this story because those
who heard his dying wishes had to go to the court and declare on oath what his
wishes were because there was no one to write them down. In the same village,
by the early seventeenth century there are so many people capable of writing a
will that one loses track of the numbers of people who are acting as scribes
for their neighbors; fifteen, twenty, in different decades, who are capable of
writing a will. That&#39;s the change which is taking place even in obscure
country parishes. </p>
<p>Even in such places
the crossing of the literacy threshold had opened up new possibilities which
simply had not existed in the past. If one thinks of late fifteenth-century
society as one of heavily restricted literacy--restricted to certain social and
occupational groups--by the early seventeenth century we have fairly widespread
literacy; a partially literate society which was well on the road to mass
literacy. And if you look at the final chart on your handout, there is the
long-term decline of illiteracy right through to 1900, and you can see that the
period we&#39;re dealing with is a significant step forward in that process. </p>
<p>Now of course it was
a very long road. Right through to the nineteenth century, illiteracy remained
closely related to the social hierarchy, but there was continuous advance from
the sixteenth century onwards. By the early eighteenth century, England was
already probably the most literate nation in Europe and still slowly improving.
Outside Europe the most literate society of the time was New England, a
colonial society which had a disproportionate number of literate people amongst
those who emigrated here. And as a result the opportunities for a more
widespread participation in the growing literate culture of the period was
expanding. Ideas and opinions which were first voiced in elite circles could
sometimes find their way down to permeate many areas of the social structure, like
sherry seeping down through a trifle. </p>
<p>That&#39;s not to say
that many people of humble place were rushing to read the more high-flown
products of the English renaissance. Some of them did. Some people who began
reading simple things became conspicuously literate and hungry for books and
went on to read whatever they could get. But there was also for more--for those
who didn&#39;t have such ambitions--a growing popular print culture which catered
directly for them. This period sees the birth of the chapbook literature;
cheap, penny, twopenny, sixpenny printed works aimed at a mass market. By the
1660s, the most popular form of such cheap books, almanacs, were being produced
on a vast scale. In London 400,000 almanacs a year were printed in the 1660s,
aimed at the mass market, and they contained all kinds of information as well
as calendars for people to use. </p>
<p>Most readers of this
stuff would not have been members of elite society, but they did have access to
some of the issues and ideas of their day. Such chapbooks enjoyed massive
sales and they formed also a kind of bridge between elite society and the mass
of the population. One of the great collections of them which survives was put
together by Samuel Pepys, Secretary to the Navy, a member of the highest-level
bureaucracy of his day, but he enjoyed the cheap literature as well as the
learned works that he had in his library. And it could be read also of course
by members of the middling and lower orders. It must have had its impact on
the common stock of images and symbols and understandings and simple
information of rich and poor alike, and it fostered a popular literacy which
could be turned to other uses. </p>
<p>If you take the
chapbook romances with their tales of knights and giants and so forth, which were
being published in the seventeenth century, and you marry them together with
the Bible, what you end up with is John Bunyan&#39;s <i>Pilgrim&#39;s Progress. </i>He
was someone who was steeped in this popular literature. He wrote <i>Pilgrim&#39;s
Progress </i>in order to provide a religious adventure story which turned out
to be the second most important book ever published in English. </p>
<p>To conclude then,
whether or not we want to talk about an educational revolution in this period,
the educational changes did constitute a very significant break with the past. However
limited, however circumscribed by class or gender, they did open up new areas
of potential in society and culture. Something momentous was gradually
happening across the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; something which
I think one can reasonably say without exaggeration was one of the great
transforming processes of the early modern period. Okay. </p>
<p>Right. Well next
time I&#39;ll take up the political narrative again, turning to the religious
problems and political problems of the early seventeenth century. </p>
