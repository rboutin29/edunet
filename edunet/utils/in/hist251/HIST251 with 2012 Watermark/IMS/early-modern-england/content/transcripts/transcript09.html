<p><b>Professor Keith Wrightson:
</b>Okay.
Well, we&#39;ve seen now how the early Tudors managed to reestablish the authority
of the monarchy; how that achievement was threatened by the succession crisis
which was looming under Henry VIII; how that problem was met by actions which
further extended royal authority over the church, but at the same time, of
course, introduced a new form of instability into the kingdom--potential
conflict over religion. But that wasn&#39;t all that was going on and there were
other sources of instability which were set in motion at around the same time
in the second quarter of the sixteenth century. What adds additional
complexity to the whole situation is the fact that there were simultaneous
shifts in some of the basic aspects of economic and social life which in 1500
would have been more or less taken for granted. The problem then had been
political instability, not social instability. But soon social instability was
to be on the agenda. And people knew by the 1530s and 1540s that they lived in
radically changing times in more ways than one. </p>
<p>The phenomenon of
which they were most acutely aware was rising prices, rising prices for the
basic necessities of life. Prices of goods had been fairly stable for most of
the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, but around about the second decade
of the sixteenth century they began rising. If you look at your handout,
section one, you&#39;ll find there an index of prices for what&#39;s described as a
basket of basic consumables, mostly foodstuffs and other essentials of life. You
can see from that index, which stands at around 100 in 1500, how prices rose
rapidly in the course of the sixteenth century. At first it was a modest
trend. It picked up momentum in the 1530s. Price rises were very rapid indeed
in the 1540s and &#39;50s and they continued to rise more slowly thereafter. So,
they faced a problem of inflation, and the causes of that inflation were
complex. They&#39;re much debated, but amongst them one of the most principal seems
to have been the fact that population was also growing. The pressure was being
felt of increasing numbers of people on relatively inelastic resources, forcing
up prices. </p>
<p>If you look at
section two of your handout, you&#39;ll see the best figures available from
demographic historians of what the population of England was at different
points in the earlier sixteenth century. The best estimates we have suggest
that in the 1520s about 2.4 million. By the 1550s that had risen to about 3
million, by 1570 3.3 million, and still rising. The annual rate of increase
can be calculated and it&#39;s there on the right-hand side. In the 1540s about
0.64% per annum, in the 1560s almost 1% per annum, 1570s over 1% per annum.
These are quite rapid rates of increase for a preindustrial population. In
fact, that kind of rate of population increase was not matched again in England
until the late eighteenth century at the height of the Industrial Revolution.
So the population was rising. </p>
<p>Now explaining why
that was so is far from easy, but in all likelihood it was to do with a fall in
death rates in the early sixteenth century in a population which had a fairly
high fertility rate and high propensity to grow if it wasn&#39;t culled by severe
mortality. So death rates, still high by our standards, seem to have been
falling somewhat. If you&#39;re interested in that kind of historical demography
and would like to pursue the issue of population dynamics, then I&#39;d be happy to
advise you on more detailed reading. But for the moment it&#39;s enough to just
register the essential facts: prices are rising; population is rising; the two
are probably connected. </p>
<p>What I want to focus
on today is the fallout from all of that: some of the stresses in society which
were produced by this dynamic of population growth and price inflation, how it
impacted on different groups in society. And one can start at the top with the
landlords, gentlemen, noblemen, the monarchy. In most cases the bulk of
landlords&#39; incomes, as you know, came from rents and they needed that income to
sustain the lifestyles which were appropriate to their station as gentlemen, to
sustain their magnificence. In that situation their biggest problem as the
sixteenth century went on was rising prices but an inflexible income. At worst
many of them had tenants who enjoyed fixed rents; they&#39;d been granted fixed
rents at some point in the past. At best they were in a position to periodically
modify the rents they got for their lands, but they were still relatively
inflexible. Land was often granted for long periods of time on a fixed
agreement for that term. It might be twenty, thirty years. Land was also let
according to customs, as you know, which had been established in particular
areas which might inhibit the landlords&#39; capacity to adjust the rent levels. That&#39;s
very bad news when prices are rising. So, how did these people cope? </p>
<p>For the most part
landlords coped by gradually trying to alter the terms on which they granted
their land to the peasantry. They tried to let it for shorter leases which
they could renegotiate more often, try to get the lease down to seven years,
ten years or whatever rather than ninety, which had been quite common in the
past. They also tried to change local customs regarding what kind of fine or
down payment they could get when they let land. For example, on the estates of
the Herbert family, which were located in Wiltshire in the southwest, in the
first half of the sixteenth century they managed to roughly double the fines
which they were getting when a new tenant took land from them. </p>
<p>Well, it was only
possible for landlords to squeeze their tenants a little harder in that way
because land was in demand. The rise in population, rise in population for the
first time in a century and a half, meant that there was demand for land in a
way that hadn&#39;t really been known since the fourteenth century. There&#39;s a lot
of evidence of people nibbling at wasteland, forest land, moor land, bringing
land into cultivation. In the Forest of Inglewood for example, which was
located up in the northwest of England, up here, there was a survey made of
illegal &#39;encroachments&#39; in the forest, people cutting out a little piece of
land for themselves where they could squat, and it revealed that over a period
of twenty or thirty years almost 200 encroachments had been made into the
forest there. </p>
<p>So pressure on the
land. And inevitably also as the population rose the size of the wholly
landless population rose too. There were more young people surviving to
adulthood for whom there was no inheritance, no place on the land. Now those
shifting circumstances, the pressures on landlords, the pressures that they&#39;d
pass on to their tenants, the pressure of population growth, helped to explain
the emergence in the early sixteenth century of some quite severe tensions in
the relationships between landlords and farm tenants. Tensions in particular
over customs and the emergence of one particular cardinal grievance, the
grievance of &#39;enclosure&#39;. </p>
<p>Now as I&#39;ve explained
earlier, in some areas of the kingdom agriculture had never been practiced in
great open fields but had been practiced already on enclosed farms. Before
1500, in the areas where there was--there were--open fields, some of them had
been reorganized by enclosing them to make sheep pastures. This was done by
landlords who were short of tenants. They found that doing that was a good way
of keeping their land in production, although a low-intensity production, when
otherwise it might go vacant or might be unprofitable. Wool was in demand from
the cloth industry so they went over to a kind of sheep ranching. At the time
that wasn&#39;t particularly controversial, but after the 1510s steps to enclose
land which had formerly been open became much more controversial. In the Midlands,
which was a major wool-supplying area, many landlords withdrew land from the
plow to turn it into sheep ranches despite the growing demand from tenants for
land. Some landlords also took in and enclosed for their own use land which
had formerly been the common pastureland of particular villages. Thereby they
reduced the area of common pasture available to their tenants, which was a
further grievance, especially since common land was particularly valuable in
conditions of land hunger. </p>
<p>Well, these changing
conditions meant that enclosure, which had previously been merely a tactic you
could adopt on your estate, became a quite significant grievance in many areas
of the kingdom. It seemed to many people a very visible sign of the changing
balance of power in rural society between lords and tenants. Sir Thomas More
in his <i>Utopia </i>refers to the phenomenon of sheep eating men in England at
this time, reflecting that sense of grievance. It&#39;s for these reasons that
issues of rents and fines and customs and common land became a quite explosive
cocktail in landlord-tenant relations by the mid-sixteenth century. </p>
<p>And there was also a
little more to it than that. The economic trends and the population trends of
the period were gradually producing a greater differentiation in village
society amongst tenants. There were those who did quite well in these
circumstances, especially the bigger farmers, the yeomanry. Quite often they
held part of their land in freehold; they were somewhat protected. Quite often
they produced a large surplus which they could market and if prices were rising
they could make bigger profits. They were able to pay higher rents without too
much trouble. They might take on more land to extend their operations, and if
they wanted to do that they were in a far better position to compete for
available land than were their poorer neighbors. So this is a period when one
sees the yeomanry becoming increasingly differentiated in their wealth and
living standards from their poorer neighbors. These were people who were able
to benefit from the trends of the period. They showed a lot of ambition in the
way they did that, and the ambition of those who were best able to take
advantage of the trends of the--this generation, that ambition is also shown in
response to another economic development of the period and this time it&#39;s an
economic development which wasn&#39;t directly connected to population or price
trends but was connected to religious changes. And I&#39;m thinking of course of
the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the bringing on to the market of vast
quantities of former monastic land. </p>
<p>Some figures relating
to this are there on your handout in section three. Basically, between 1536
and 1540 about 60% of the land which was owned by the church was transferred to
the crown through the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Many studies have been
done of individual counties. In the county of Essex, down here to the east of
London, for example, the church had owned about 28% of the manors in that
county. By 1540, after the Dissolution it owned only 2%; a massive transfer of
land. Well, these seizures of church land were probably intended by Thomas
Cromwell to endow the crown in perpetuity with massive land holdings which
would render it absolutely unchallengeable and indeed might even render it
independent of any grants of taxation from Parliament. But if that was
Cromwell&#39;s intention it failed to materialize, because most of the monastic
land was quite rapidly disposed of by the crown. By the time Henry VIII
himself died in 1547, he had already sold something like two thirds of the
monastery land which had come in to him, and still more of this land was sold
later. For example, there&#39;s been a study done of the whole of Wales which
shows that of the monastic land there 60% had gone by the death of Henry in
1547 and by the time Elizabeth came to the throne in 1558 75% of the monastery
land had been disposed of. </p>
<p>Why would the crown
dispose of the land in this kind of way? Well, basically to pay for wars; wars
which were getting more expensive, requiring fortresses, modern weapons, new
ships and so forth. Henry VIII in his last years engaged in short, inconclusive,
utterly futile, assertions of his rights, as he saw them, against France and
against Scotland resulting in wars and massive expenditure which accounted for
much of the monastic land. </p>
<p>For our purposes
today it&#39;s interesting to note the results of studies which have looked at the
identities of who&#39;s buying this land from the crown. Quite a lot went to the
heads of established noble and gentry families, people who were anxious to take
advantage of this wonderful opportunity to consolidate their estates, to
rationalize the estates and so forth, to build up their holdings in particular
areas of their strength. Another group who emerged quite strongly are people
who were the youngest sons of such gentry and noble families, people who in the
normal course of events would expect most of the family&#39;s property to pass to
their older brothers, but who now had an opportunity to get in and get some
land for themselves. Younger brothers. They could set up cadet branches of the
family and sometimes they did so with the money which they had generated in
trade or in professions. Younger sons were often put into trade or into
professions and were able to make the money which enabled them to return to
landed society and set themselves up as minor gentlemen. </p>
<p>Another significant
group were upwardly mobile people from the middle ranks of society: yeoman
farmers piecing together field to field until they could emerge with a
sufficient estate to call themselves gentlemen; people from the towns who had
no gentry ancestry, perhaps lawyers, perhaps merchants, prosperous craftsmen
and tradesmen, who were able to acquire land and its superior social status,
perhaps in some cases on a level which would again bring them into the lower
ranks of the gentry. So there were customers enough for this monastic land,
and to serve their needs there were many speculators. A lot of the monastic
land was bought by speculators who rapidly sold it on. </p>
<p>The overall effects
of this was a kind of feeding frenzy in the land market. It resulted of course
not only in the severe reduction of the position of the church as a great
landowner, but it also resulted ultimately in a very significant rise in both
the numbers of those who called themselves gentlemen and in the relative wealth
of the gentry as a whole. So some people were doing very well out of all of
this, but of course it&#39;s not all buoyancy. No process of change of this kind
ever is, and so one has to ask, &quot;who were the losers in these processes?&quot; And
there are some large and quite obvious groups. </p>
<p>Amongst the losers
were the small farm tenants who couldn&#39;t easily meet rising rents, who didn&#39;t
sell enough on the market to produce the profits which would pay them, who were
finding it difficult to make ends meet. Then there were those who were--one
could think of as would-be farm tenants, those who might aspire to getting a
foothold on the land but found it increasingly difficult because rents were
rising, fines were rising and so forth, and they couldn&#39;t compete with the
bigger guys in the village who could take up land that came available on the
local market. It could be quite a difficult time for the young in that respect.
But above all there were the growing numbers of landless people in the
countryside or in the towns whose living depended principally on what they
could earn from wage earning as laborers and the rights to use commons which
they might enjoy in the places where they lived. </p>
<p>Those who depended on
wages were particularly hard hit by inflation and despite the fact that prices
were rising, squeezing their living standards, wages rose only slowly because
the population was growing and there was plenty of labor available. Wages
tended to remain pretty sticky at customary levels for long periods of time. That
meant that people&#39;s real wages, the real purchasing power of their wages, was
falling. And quite close studies of this have been done and they suggest that
between 1510 and 1550 the purchasing power of wages fell by about 40% in the
south of England. By the 1550s, they were down 50% and they began to recover
modestly only in the later sixteenth century. So these were quite hard times
for a lot of people. William Harrison, who wrote a famous description of
England at the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth, described how many of what
he described as the &quot;inferior sort of people&quot; lived principally on what he
called &quot;white meats&quot;: eggs and cheese and bread. In times of dearth they were
particularly hard hit and might have to live on peas and beans or even ground
acorns which they tried to bake into bread. He added, &quot;I will not say
that this extremity is often also found in times of plenty, but if I should I
could easily stand my trial.&quot; That&#39;s Harrison&#39;s ironic comment on the
living standards of the poor in his time. </p>
<p>Well, all of this is
reflected in a growing contemporary concern with the problem of poverty. There
had always been poor of course, but poverty as a major social problem hadn&#39;t
been a major issue in the fifteenth century. It was more a matter of the
poverty that resulted from life cycle crises of a small minority of people: the
widowed, the aged, the sick, orphaned children. These were the ones that
contemporaries referred to as the &quot;impotent poor,&quot; those who could not help
themselves, those who were poor by circumstance beyond their control. But as
the sixteenth century advanced people began talking and writing about poverty
in two worryingly expanded forms. </p>
<p>They first became
aware of the problem of vagrancy, the problem of what they called &#39;rogues and
vagabonds&#39;, homeless people visible on the streets of the towns or on the roads
of the countryside. People like one man who was arrested by the justices of
the peace over near the Welsh border who, in the examination which they took
from him, told them that he was a person who dwells no--I&#39;m quoting the
examination--who &quot;dwells nowhere nor has no abiding but where he might find
work.&quot; The vagrant looking for work, moving around the countryside. People
like this were a much more common sight as the sixteenth century advanced. It&#39;s
quite interesting that in his translation of the New Testament William Tyndale,
in trying to describe a scene from the Acts of the Apostles where Saint Paul is
attacked by a mob in Thessalonica, translated the Greek word which literally
means people standing in the street, he translated it as &quot;vagabonds.&quot; When
Tyndale tried to imagine people hanging around in the street he imagined them
as some of these vagrants who he would have seen in the streets of London. </p>
<p>So vagrancy, rogues
and vagabonds, are emerging as a significant problem. On the other hand, there
was the growing problem of what they described as the &quot;laboring poor,&quot; people
whose whole style of life was based increasingly on a kind of economy of
makeshifts, getting work wherever they could. Working, certainly, but finding
it increasingly difficult to make ends meet. The laboring poor, people who
would also fall into really severe poverty if they suffered any misfortune; if
they couldn&#39;t find work, if there was a depression in the cloth industry, if
they fell sick, and so forth. These people were especially visible in areas
where wage workers were concentrated, principally the towns or those areas of
the countryside where many people worked in rural industries. </p>
<p>Okay then. Let&#39;s
just take stock. By the 1540s, rising prices and demographic growth had seen
in some ways a quickening of economic activity. For some people this brought
new opportunities and indeed enhanced prosperity. But at the same time there was
also a growing sense of tension in the relationships between landlords and
their peasant tenants, an emerging problem of land hunger, a growing problem of
a wage laboring population which was very vulnerable to poverty on an
unaccustomed scale. Now people were aware of these changes, they were aware of
the tensions, but from their perspective at the time it was the symptoms of
change which were more apparent than the actual causes. It was exceedingly
difficult for people in the sixteenth century to comprehend what was happening
to them. They didn&#39;t keep official statistics. The figures which are on your
handout have been calculated by historians using a variety of sources. Contemporaries
didn&#39;t have information of this kind. They tended to perceive changes and
emergent problems of this kind through their inherited attitudes, their
essentially medieval moral philosophy; a view of the world in which economic
behavior wasn&#39;t treated as a distinct area of activity, a phenomenon to be
studied in itself by the science of economics, they saw it as a branch of
personal and social morality. The ideal world in their view was the world of the
commonwealth, which I&#39;ve described to you. They saw these problems as failings
in the ideal of the commonwealth, failings which could be attributed to the
misdeeds of specific people. </p>
<p>Well, these ideas not
only persisted throughout the early sixteenth century but they were powerfully
reemphasized in the 1540s with the emergence of a group of moralists, most of
them Protestant clergymen, in the reign of Edward VI, who addressed these
social and economic grievances. They were known at the time as the &quot;Commonwealth&#39;s
Men&quot; because they talked constantly about the needs of the commonwealth. Such
people also saw the reformation not simply in terms of the jurisdictional
independence of the Church of England from the Church of Rome, or simply in
terms of fundamental doctrinal changes. They also thought it was an
opportunity for the re-moralizing of society, the revitalization of Christian
values in society. They advocated an ideal Christian commonwealth. They
thought this was the opportunity to achieve it, and yet they saw all around
them evidence of the corruption of social relationships by what they saw as the
cardinal sin of covetousness, one of their favorite words,
covetousness--greed--and the pernicious idea again which they constantly refer
to that, quote, &quot;every man may do with his own as he will.&quot; The
motion that every man may do with his own as he will, which they regarded as an
unchristian attitude. </p>
<p>In their view,
worldly goods were given by God to be handled with stewardship, with an
interest to society as a whole. So their social vision was essentially
conservative. They saw change in terms of social dislocation and moral
corruption. They denounced the representatives of covetousness whom they
identified. They spoke for example of &quot;ungentle gentlemen.&quot; They attacked what
they called the &quot;caterpillars of the commonwealth&quot; who were eating up its green
shoots. They attacked what they saw as exploitation and oppression of the poor,
and they did all of this in a language reminiscent of Old Testament prophets. R.
H. Tawney, a great historian of these changes, says they used the moral
rhetoric, in his words, of &quot;an age that had rediscovered the Bible.&quot; Well, it
hadn&#39;t rediscovered it. It had discovered it for the first time in English,
and as I say, the language of Jeremiah or Isaiah is the kind of language that
they used to denounce what they saw as a world out of joint. </p>
<p>Well, the pamphlets
written by these people in the 1540s and 1550s are a quite magnificent
literature of moral indignation. It still has the capacity to thrill when you
read it. It indicated also what&#39;s been described by one recent historian as a &quot;crisis
of legitimation,&quot; a crisis of legitimation. [Historian in question is Andy
Wood.] The world seemed out of joint in so many ways, but response to change
also took a more direct form. There were not only those who were appealing for
reform, for moral reformation, for people to behave as they should, there were
also those who were prepared to directly resist these changes especially in the
countryside. From about the 1530s onwards, researchers working on records of
local government and on the courts find that the country was increasingly
pockmarked with minor forms of disorder as the peasantry of particular
localities resisted initiatives on the part of their landlords, perhaps rioting
against the enclosing of fields or of common land and so forth, or against
changes in their customs and tenures. And such resistance becomes above all
evident in some of the great risings of the commons which took place in the
middle third of the sixteenth century, risings which convulsed first the north
of England and then the east of England in particular. </p>
<p>The first of these
risings was the Pilgrimage of Grace of 1536, a rising of much of the north of
England. This was a complex event. It combined religious hostility to the
reformation and a desire to defend the monasteries, which had been ordered to
be dissolved, with a variety of other grievances and in particular agrarian
grievances against the enclosing of commons and the forcing up of entry fines
to land. It was described by those who took part in it as a &quot;pilgrimage of
grace for the commonwealth,&quot; for the commonwealth as a whole, and those who
mustered for the pilgrimage, some 20,000 men, regarded themselves as defending
each branch of the commonwealth. They wanted the king to turn away from his
evil counselors, they wanted the ancient rights of the nobility to be properly
recognized, they wanted the rights of the church to be respected and, as they
put in one of their statements of grievances, they also demanded that the &quot;commonalty
be used as they should be&quot;--&quot;the commonality be used as they should be&quot;--particularly
in matters relating to the land. </p>
<p>So this was a complex
event. It led to the rebel army eventually mustering near Pontefract in South
Yorkshire, having taken the city of York where it faced a standoff with royal
troops under the Duke of Norfolk. The Duke negotiated with the rebels,
persuaded those gentlemen who had joined them, in particular, to act as
negotiators with the crown, promised that their grievances would be met, and
persuaded them to disperse. The rebels were wrong to trust Norfolk. He was
already writing to the crown that he regarded no promises made to a rebel as
binding. And when the crown got the opportunity with the flurry of a few more
agrarian troubles in the northwest at the beginning of the following year royal
troops went in and suppressed them with considerable violence. Robert Aske,
the leader of the rebels who was a lawyer from York, along with a number of
other figures, was arrested, tried and executed for treason. That was the
Pilgrimage of Grace, probably the biggest threat that the Tudor monarchy ever
faced. </p>
<p>Then in 1549 came
another widespread burst of unrest known as the &quot;Camping Time,&quot; because many
tenants from particular areas were gathering together in protest and forming
camps. These were scattered all over central, eastern and southern England. Many
of these camps were ultimately dispersed. The Earl of Arundel in Sussex for
example, down towards the south coast, met the protesting peasants, assured
them that he would speak for them on their behalf, and persuaded them to
disperse. This was the way that it could sometimes be handled and Arundel kept
his word; he did speak for them. </p>
<p>But one particular
rising did not disperse and that was the one in the county of Norfolk led by
Robert Kett, a yeoman farmer. Kett&#39;s rebels advanced to set up a camp just
outside Norwich, on Mousehold Heath outside Norwich, where Kett, who was very
well organized, had a supply system to keep the--to keep his army, as it was by
then, well supplied. He sat under an oak tree on the heath which was known as
the Oak of Reformation and there with his counsel he delivered justice to the
local farm tenants against their gentlemen landlords. The principal grievances
of the Norfolk rising were agrarian. They were protesting against enhanced
rents and against the abuses of common land by their landlords. And they&#39;re
also remarkable in that Kett&#39;s rebels refused to disperse. Eventually, a royal
army was sent against them. It consisted mostly of mercenaries who had been
hired from Germany and Italy. They didn&#39;t dare use English troops for fear
they would sympathize with the rebels. Kett&#39;s army refused to disperse and
went down fighting in a battle at Dussindale just outside the city of Norwich. </p>
<p>It&#39;s been said of
these peasant rebels that they were trying to create &quot;a world in which
gentlemen were kept at arm&#39;s length.&quot; They were trying to preserve the rights
that they had in the land in a changing economic climate which threatened to diminish
them, trying to create a world in which gentlemen were kept at arm&#39;s length,
and their statements of grievances and demands make very interesting reading. There&#39;s
a rich literature on these rebellions. If anyone&#39;s interested in that for an
essay topic, I&#39;d be happy to advise you. </p>
<p>So in seeking to
restore what was essentially an idealized vision of stable social
relationships, the just commonwealth, an ideal which they located in a past
golden age, both the peasant rebels and the literary Commonwealth Men, the
preachers and clergy, had a great deal in common. And together they give
perhaps the most vivid expression, literary expression and practical
expression, to the sense that many people had in the mid-sixteenth century that
the bonds of society, the bonds of commonwealth, were fraying and falling apart.
But neither the Commonwealth&#39;s Men in their books and sermons nor the peasant
rebels could turn back the dynamic of change. Moral exhortation or localized
protest by people who couldn&#39;t face a royal army effectively were not enough
and both were swept aside after 1549. </p>
<p>It&#39;s one of the nice
ironies of history that the place outside Norwich, now in the suburbs, where
Kett&#39;s rebels were finally defeated very bloodily--many were slaughtered--Dussindale,
is now the site of a shopping mall. So the English peasantry made their last
stand there and it&#39;s now a shopping mall, a sort of shrine to modern
consumerism. Amongst the murals that decorate it there&#39;s one of Robert Kett
sitting under the Tree of Reformation, which I hope schoolchildren in Norwich
will all recognize as they go about their shopping. </p>
<p>But it wasn&#39;t all
repression. There&#39;s another side to the story. By 1549, some people in
positions of authority in the kingdom were equally concerned about all of this
and they were trying to come to grips with change in an alternative way. A
striking piece of evidence of this is a wonderful composition written for
circulation in manuscript in 1549 by Sir Thomas Smith and entitled <i>The
Discourse of the Commonweal of England</i>. It&#39;s a remarkable piece of
writing. It wasn&#39;t published until after Smith&#39;s death, and at one time it was
actually attributed to William Shakespeare, but it&#39;s now pretty certain that it
was written by Sir Thomas Smith. He was professor of civil law at the
University of Cambridge and a leading member later in his career of the royal
Privy Council under Edward VI and subsequently under Elizabeth I. Smith was
trying to think out the problems of his day, not to denounce the moral failings
of particular individuals or groups, but to try to understand what was going
on, to try to understand the motives and the pressures that were felt by
different people in society. And he did that by having a discussion. He wrote
a dialog between a gentleman, a husbandman--a peasant, a craftsman--a wage
worker, and a figure called the Doctor who is a sort of academic figure who
acts as a kind of moderator for this discussion. He imagines them all sitting
outside a pub discussing the affairs of the commonwealth. It&#39;s because of this
dialog form that it was once attributed to Shakespeare. </p>
<p>The representatives
of the different groups in <i>The Discourse of the Commonweal</i> put their own
perspectives, their own grievances. The different voices of different interest
groups are heard. The Doctor who acts as moderator provides a kind of
disinterested analytical authority helping to explore the underlying causes to
propose solutions, to think of ways that the interests of different groups
might be reconciled. So, for example, when the view is put by the gentlemen
that all men are free &quot;to make their most advantage of that which is their own,&quot;
the phrase--well, close to the phrase--which was always being denounced by the Commonwealth&#39;s
Men, Smith has the Doctor reply not by denouncing covetousness but by saying, yes,
they may, but they &quot;may not abuse their own... to the damage of the commonweal.&quot;
Good lords should set limits to the pursuit of individual economic interest. In
short then, he&#39;s willing to accept the simple reality of self-interested
behavior but he seeks to prevent abuses or to channel that behavior in ways
that it might serve the common interest through the encouragement of
enterprise. </p>
<p>It&#39;s because of that
kind of attitude that Smith has been described as the father of political
economy and there&#39;s some justice in that. But essentially, putting him in his
own time, he was in the classical humanist tradition. He had great faith in
the positive effects of good government as a means of harmonizing conflicting
interests, and that&#39;s what he&#39;s trying essentially to achieve. Well, Sir
Thomas Smith wasn&#39;t alone and he had considerable influence upon like-minded
statesmen under Edward VI and still more in the early years of Elizabeth I. He
sat himself in Elizabeth&#39;s council. He was responsible for drafting some of
the early legislation of her parliaments. He was a very close friend of her
chief advisor, Sir William Cecil. And it led, this kind of attitude among
Smith and others, to a kind of dual strategy on the part of government which is
gradually emerging in the mid-sixteenth century. </p>
<p>On the one hand, they
want to stabilize things; they want to dampen things down; they want to re-knit
the fraying fabric of the commonwealth. On the other hand, they were very
aware of the need to pursue, where possible, orderly economic growth. And this
issued in a number of statutes, which are listed in the last part of your
handout and which I&#39;ll just briefly mention, which were intended to be steps
towards these ends. In 1551, the coinage was revalued and reissued in an
attempt to curb the worst excesses of inflation. In 1552, legislation was
passed against abuses in marketing again with a view to the problems occasioned
by the price rise. In the 1550s, the royal courts were made more open to hear
the grievances of the peasantry, some of whom had not previously been able to
plead in royal courts. In 1563--we&#39;re now into the reign of Elizabeth--the
Statute of Artificers was passed, the longest single act of Parliament passed
in England before the twentieth century, which went into great detail in
attempts to regulate relationships between employers and employees; to lay down
rules, to introduce for example annual assessments of wages so that wages could
be adjusted in line with prices. In 1563, legislation was passed to restrict
not all forms of enclosure but those forms of enclosure which were thought to
be harmful. If enclosure was beneficial it would be permitted. And in addition
they introduced, on the model of experiments which had been attempted in a
number of towns, forms of relief for the impotent poor; a constructive system
of poor relief which was to operate at the level of the parish involving the
raising of money from local taxation of those who could afford it, the &quot;poor
rate,&quot; and the dispersal of that money to the impotent poor. </p>
<p>Finally, efforts were
made to encourage economically enterprising people who brought projects to the
government: the establishment of new trade routes, the encouragement of
shipping and fishing, the establishment of new manufacturing industries which
might be granted a royal patent, giving them a monopoly until they were
established,--it&#39;s the origins of the patent system--the encouragement of
immigration of skilled Protestant refugees from abroad, especially from the
Netherlands where the religious wars were raging. </p>
<p>So one mustn&#39;t
exaggerate the impact of all of this. This is the sixteenth century. Their
powers of enforcement were limited. But efforts were being made, very visible
efforts to do something about the situation. And that marked a significant
step forward in the conception of the responsibilities of the Tudor state, a
broadening of its role, an increasing presence in attempting to shape, to
channel, the economic and social developments of the time, to develop policy to
deal with the problems that they produced. And that helped shape the
environment of change as people gradually moved from the first shocks of
response to these changing features of the economic and social environment and
began to enter a period of transition in the late sixteenth century towards a
more thoroughly commercial economy, which is something I&#39;ll touch on later. </p>
<p>But for now we need
to turn back again, having looked at what was happening in the mid-sixteenth
century outside the religious sphere, to the issues of the reformation and the
settlement which was attempted with the accession in 1558 of Elizabeth, and
we&#39;ll take that up on Tuesday. </p>
