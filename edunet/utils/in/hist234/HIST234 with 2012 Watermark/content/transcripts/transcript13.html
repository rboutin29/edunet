<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
As you know, one of the long-term themes in our course has been intellectual
history, and the impact of epidemic diseases on that. And this morning, in
that light, I&#39;m going to be looking at one of the great medical debates--in
particular, a great medical debate of the nineteenth century--which was the
so-called debate between contagionism and anticontagionism. Now, why would we
be interested in it? First of all, if we&#39;re going to understand nineteenth-century
medicine, we have to realize that if you were to go back, say, to reading <i>The
Lancet</i>, one of the major medical journals of the nineteenth century, or say
the <i>Proceedings of the French Academy of Medicine</i>, you would see that
they were--one of the leading issues that was being hotly debated was the
rights and wrongs, the scientific evidence for and against, the idea of
contagionism, and its opponents, the idea of anticontagionism. </p>
<p>This was really a
hot-button topic in nineteenth century medicine. It consumed the middle
decades of the century. So, if we&#39;re going to--if part of our course is to
understand what was happening in the world of medicine, well this debate was
really crucial in it. Another part of our interest in this debate is that it
brings to a conclusion much of our consideration of Asiatic cholera. We&#39;ve
talked about the impact of cholera, and we need to recognize that its impact
was partly in the realm of ideas. Its legacy didn&#39;t include just death, fear,
social tension. It didn&#39;t just leave behind it sewer lines and water pipes, in
Britain, the broad boulevards of Paris and Lyon, the rebuilt Lower City of
Naples; in addition it left behind it a major debate on the causes of disease,
and epidemic diseases in particular. And this is the debate between
contagionism and anticontagionism. </p>
<p>It&#39;s useful for us to
turn to this debate also because it helps us to prepare the ground for one of
the most important discoveries in the history of science, and certainly medical
science, and that&#39;s the establishment of the germ theory of disease, which is
our topic for next week. So, what we&#39;ll want to do then is we&#39;ll be moving
towards the victory of contagionism. This is a debate then that really
mattered in medical history. Now, in discussing this issue, there are a couple
of pitfalls that I think we ought to avoid. They&#39;re distorting and make it
difficult for us really to understand history in general, and history of
science in particular. </p>
<p>Let me point out two
pitfalls. The first is a possibility of what&#39;s been called the Whiggish view
of history. In its application to science, it sees history of science as a
linear, upward march of truth, moving steadily forward over ignorance and obscurantism;
that is, a history of constant progress. And it&#39;s reinforced if our history of
science deals and examines exclusively the ideas that finally triumph, so that
we study only a constant progress, the march from one great idea to the next. </p>
<p>Another possible
danger and pitfall is what&#39;s called presentism, which I might define as the
rather smug view that science all along has been striving, almost in Lamarckian
manner, to make the benighted people of the past finally emerge as smart as we
are, and we get to look back condescendingly on the thinkers of past centuries,
giving them marks for how right or how wrong we now know that they were. So,
to avoid those pitfalls, what I&#39;d like to do is to approach this in a different
spirit. </p>
<p>Next time I will take
the more traditional path of looking at the victorious germ theory of disease,
and at that point we&#39;ll pay our respects to the famous trio of nineteenth-century
science that you all know of: Louis Pasteur, Robert Koch, Joseph Lister. And
in doing that, we&#39;ll notice that what triumphed wasn&#39;t only disembodied
scientific truth--I&#39;m not disputing, let me stress this, I&#39;m not going to be
disputing the truth of the germ theory of disease. But what I&#39;ll want to do is
something a little more subtle, which is to notice that what triumphed wasn&#39;t
just disembodied truth, but also a worldview, and that when that worldview won
out, there were some losses as well, that went with it. </p>
<p>The germ theory of
disease is one of the greatest advances in the history of science. But we need
to argue that although true, it perhaps wasn&#39;t the entirely of truth, and that
its establishment as a reigning orthodoxy, by the end of the nineteenth
century--because it does, in fact, come to be held by the entirety of the
international medical community really after around the 1890s or so. And that
brought with it one of its consequences--an unintended one--was certain
negative impacts on understanding of disease that we&#39;ll be talking about. And
to understand and appreciate this fact, I&#39;m going to concentrate this morning
not on the victors--you know about them already, to some extent, and we&#39;ll be
turning to them for the whole of next week--but I&#39;d like to look instead at
someone you probably don&#39;t know, or maybe not know at all. </p>
<p>In fact, just out of
curiously, before we talked about him in our course and reading, how many of
you had actually heard of Max van Pettenkofer? See, that&#39;s what I suspected,
actually no one had heard of Max van Pettenkofer. All the more reason we&#39;re
going to--the good news for you is we&#39;re going to be dealing with him for the
next forty minutes or so. He&#39;s the most sophisticated and scientifically
robust of those who were, as we might call, wrong. He lived from 1818 to 1901,
and one of the great figures of nineteenth century medical science, although
his scientific defeat was total and humiliating by the 1890s. And, indeed,
that might form part of the background to the fact that he was to commit
suicide at the turn of the twentieth century, when he shot himself.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m going to try
to understand that he was not just simply wrong, but I&#39;ll argue that he was
splendidly wrong; that his mistaken ideas actually saved millions of lives, and
that their defeat had a paradoxical consequence, not only of advancing medical
science, but in some ways impoverishing it, in ways that are important and that
we might want to consider. Well, who was Max van Pettenkofer? And since you
hadn&#39;t met him before, let me introduce you to him. And here he is, in
splendor. And he was a German scientist and physician. </p>
<p>In particular--map of
Germany--Pettenkofer is associated with Bavaria, here in the south of
Germany--let&#39;s look at that a little more closely--and he was associated
especially with the city of Munich. And I&#39;m pointing this out to you, not
simply so that you&#39;ll know where he&#39;s from; although that&#39;s nice to know. But
this is extremely significant in his theories, in that he tends to be the
defender of localism and the autonomy of Bavaria and Munich, against the centralizing
tendencies of Germany as a whole. So, it has a political significance that
we&#39;ll be turning to. </p>
<p>Now, what were his
social origins? Who was he? He came from a Catholic family of very modest
means but lots of children. And the family, that is his nuclear family, didn&#39;t
really have the means to afford him with a higher education, and he gained that
because of an uncle. He had a wealthier uncle, who was a prominent apothecary,
but alas, had no sons, and he wanted his nephew, Max, to carry on the family
business. So, Max van Pettenkofer started out life by studying pharmacy and
chemistry, and this, in fact, was to have an impact on his medical theories.
But he soon discovered that he hated the subjects he had originally enrolled in
to study, and he terminally disappointed his uncle when he enrolled as a
medical student. And he gained his medical degree in 1843 from the University
of Munich. </p>
<p>Thereafter, he had a
varied career for a few years, casting about for what he wanted to do in life.
He worked for a while for a mint, and he even had a failed attempt to become a
stage actor. But in 1847, he gained appointment to the medical faculty at
Munich, and became also a professor of organic chemistry. From then on, he
enjoyed a meteoric career as one of the rising stars of science in Bavaria and
Germany, and Europe in general. He became advisor to the Bavarian Government,
and a full Professor of Medicine in 1853. </p>
<p>Now, 1854 changed his
life, and it did so in relationship to an outbreak of Asiatic cholera in
Germany. And it&#39;s interesting that this is the very same epidemic that Snow
studied in London. But whereas Snow was a contagionist, Pettenkofer reached
the exact opposite conclusion; indeed, thereafter he became a lifelong opponent
of Snow&#39;s ideas and what he referred to, with scorn, as &quot;the English water mania.&quot;
The English, he said, were obsessed with water. </p>
<p>Well, what was the
debate and why was it so passionately held? Now, the debate was obviously
about the issue of whether diseases are contagious or not. But it didn&#39;t
involve all disease. No one doubted, in the nineteenth century, that syphilis,
for example, was contagious. The debate was about a subset of diseases, five in
particular: leprosy, typhus, and then what we might call &quot;the big three&quot;:
plague, yellow fever and cholera. In other words, the debate centered on the
diseases that were the most feared diseases of the nineteenth century, and so
the debate was passionate because it concerned diseases that were extremely
important. And it wasn&#39;t just a matter of academic disagreement.</p>
<p>The decision on
whether you defined a disease as contagious or not had a practical importance.
It meant what are going to be the public health strategies that you&#39;d devise to
combat it? And the European powers were greatly divided as to whether they
should defend themselves by quarantine, the great contagionist measure, or
not. Well the two sides in the debate then were contagionism and
anticontagionism. Let&#39;s start with contagionism. This wasn&#39;t a new idea at
all in the nineteenth century. But it was unknown to the Greeks. But it was
part of biblical tradition. And you&#39;ve heard of its popularization already by
the Italian physician Fracastoro in the sixteenth century. Contagionism had a
widespread importance in popular culture as well. </p>
<p>The contagionist
idea, by the nineteenth century, was that there was some infectious material.
Some people thought it was a poison--a chemical, in other words. Others, that
it might be--it was pure speculation--a living entity, an animalcule--you&#39;ll
see that word in John Snow, for example, in one of his speculative
moments--that was transmitted in some manner, perhaps person to person, perhaps
through the pores, perhaps by contact with a sick person, perhaps by objects
that had been in contact with that person. And you&#39;ve just been reading a very
powerful expression of the contagionist position, and that&#39;s the work of John
Snow. But an important thing to remember was that down to the 1890s,
contagionism--and this may surprise you--was primarily the standpoint of
popular culture, rather than of the medical elite. Whereas anticontagionism
dominated the international medical profession. </p>
<p>Most men of science
regarded contagionism as a view held by the ignorant and the superstitious, and
indeed the irony is that contagionism reached a nadir, in respectability, just
before the work of Koch and Pasteur demonstrated its ultimate vitality. To
understand that, take an example that by now you know extremely well, and that
is plague. To the layman, the spread of plague seemed to justify the idea that
by some means, that people still didn&#39;t understand, it spread from one person
to another. But to the learned physician, the case for contagion still seemed
weak. There wasn&#39;t a mechanism to explain what it was, how it was
transmitted. In many cases, close inspection seemed to demonstrate that the
disease spread without the direct contact that the contagionist view seemed to
postulate. </p>
<p>People caught the
plague who hadn&#39;t been in immediate contact with another plague victim.
Conversely, where there was such contact, often the plague didn&#39;t spread, and
people who cared for a plague victim sometimes didn&#39;t fall ill. How could that
be explained? Furthermore, epidemics of plague began and ended in the most
mysterious manner, that no one could plausibly explain. And to strengthen
their case, the contagionists would need to discard their theory of inanimate
contagion, replacing it with something that was living. Furthermore, there was
the need for the idea of transmission of over distance, by water perhaps, food
supplies, or later, we&#39;ll see, insect vectors. But the debate was also fueled
by political conclusions, by politics, because major conclusions followed from
the position that one adopted. </p>
<p>Contagionists, in
their scientific conclusions, were people who buttressed the power of the
state. Because in the name of state power, one could institute the most
draconian measures: cordons, lazarettos, quarantine. You could sequester and
confine individuals, you could limit civil liberty, and you could radically
control the movement of goods and of trade. So, one of the results then of
contagionism--you can see here the idea. Here you have cholera, yellow fever
and plague trying to enter the citadel at the gates. And here we have
quarantine and the draconian measures that follow from that. Cleanliness, you
know--by now, you&#39;re experts on the filth theory of disease and the measures to
be adopted against it. The idea of contagionism buttressed those ideas of a
strong, powerful state interventionism. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s turn then to
their opponents, the anticontagionists, the people who were skeptical with
regard to the ideas of John Snow. These were largely associated with the
political left. Why? Anticontagionism implied free trade. It was associated
with liberalism, and with the defense of individual liberties against arbitrary
state bureaucracies. It implied opposition to extreme, and sometimes violent,
plague measures of public health. So, it wasn&#39;t by coincidence that it was a
good idea to look at a map of Germany, because the most important of the
contagionists, Robert Koch, was an icon and promoter of the power of the
centralized German state. He worked in Berlin, and that wasn&#39;t by chance, and
he defended the centralizing and imperial interests of the German Reich.
Whereas Pettenkofer was a liberal, who championed the local interests of
Bavaria and Munich, and indeed his theories coincided--both medically and
politically, they were sometimes referred to as localism. </p>
<p>Another way of seeing
the stakes in this debate is to remember that Britain long opposed the
contagionist position, in part for political and economic reasons. That is to
say, Britain was ranged in the international conferences largely with
anticontagionists; in part because its interests prospered best through free
trade, and it felt threatened by medical arguments that implied that the state
should interfere with commerce, impounding British ships and quarantining their
crews for forty days. The anticontagionists also had the imprimatur, should we
like, of tradition, of the authority of tradition. Their views were sanctioned
by Hippocrates and Galen, and were buttressed by a whole panoply of ideas that
had grown up later but were, if we like, compatible with the traditional
practice of medicine, with the idea of atmospheric influences, of the epidemic
constitution, as it was called--a bit of jargon for you--of the atmosphere.
And it was compatible with the filth and miasmic theory. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s also remember
that anticontagionism inspired some robust health measures as well, and it
saved lives. Anticontagionism was the view of people like Chadwick, whom you
know now, and his associate, Southwood Smith. It was the view of Haussmann and
the Second Empire, and it was the official doctrine of <i>risanamento</i>; that
is, the rebuilding of Naples. Now, in the history of medicine and public
health, and epidemiology, the cholera epidemic of 1854 looms large, giving rise
to two foundational texts of epidemiology, on opposite sides of the debate. On
the one side we see John Snow; and you&#39;ve read his <i>On the Mode of
Communication of Cholera</i>, the final version of which--it was first drafted
in 1849, but the draft that you have appeared after this event. And this was
the classic statement of the contagionist view, to the extent that it could be
supported without the definitive evidence later provided by microscopy. </p>
<p>So, Snow did
everything that it was possible to do, purely on the basis of epidemiological
evidence. There was going to need to be a conceptual shift in order to clinch
his view and demonstrate it so that it was broadly accepted. On the other
side, we see a book that&#39;s been--it&#39;s not even on our own reading list--a book
that&#39;s been largely forgotten. This is Max van Pettenkofer&#39;s work called <i>Investigations
and Observations on the Method of Spread of Cholera</i>, published in 1855.
And this--I should say that Pettenkofer was no less rigorous as an
epidemiologist than John Snow. And this was a major foundational text in
epidemiology. It was a study of the 1854 epidemic in Bavaria, reaching
conclusions that were diametrically opposed to those of Snow. </p>
<p>From 1854, cholera
became a lifelong preoccupation of Max van Pettenkofer, and he devoted himself
to the epidemiological study of the disease, staking his reputation on high
profile debates with Robert Koch. He was to write some two hundred articles
and books during his lifetime, on a whole range of scientific topics. But the
largest number, about sixty, were devoted to cholera, and its transmission and
cause. So, Pettenkofer--and the reason we&#39;re dealing with him now is he was
the last major, and the best, defender of the anticontagionist doctrine, of
miasmatism, in other words. And he defended it until his death at the dawn of
the twentieth century. He adopted the traditional doctrine, dating back to
antiquity, but provided it with a new evidence-based, scientific underpinning.
</p>
<p>Well, why was
Pettenkofer not convinced by Snow when it came to cholera? Part of the reason
you know. Contagionism, Pettenkofer said--and in this he was right--it didn&#39;t
produce a really plausible mechanism for the transmission of the disease. It
correlated cholera cases with drinking water. But to Pettenkofer, there seemed
no means of explaining exactly what was transmitted, or how. Also, as you
know, Pettenkofer had been trained as a chemist, and he looked at the
traditional idea that the cholera poison was some sort of chemical substance, and
he argued that it was entirely improbable that a disease could be spread then
in the manner postulated. Looking at London and the River Thames, how could a
poison contaminating the Thames, if it was a chemical, not be infinitely
diluted? Furthermore, he said there was a whole series of what we might call
cholera mysteries that Snow&#39;s position didn&#39;t help to illuminate. </p>
<p>Why did an epidemic
start, and why did it end? Why could doctors provide their services in the
midst of an epidemic of cholera and yet not fall ill of it themselves? What
caused the pronounced seasonality of cholera? Why was its onset almost
invariably in the spring and the summer? And why did an outbreak always seem
to ebb with the onset of cold weather? And then lastly, for the moment, there
was what we might call the problem of Lyon; that is, the great second city of
France. If cholera is contagious, and if it follows the great routes of trade
and population movement, why is it that there are, nonetheless, major centers
that escaped throughout the nineteenth century? Lyon was the second largest
city in France, located at the hub of a network of trade and transportation,
and it had all the--it was a great textile center of manufacturing--and it had
all the urban problems of an industrial center at its time. </p>
<p>If ever, Pettenkofer
would say, there was a city that seemed primed to be devastated by Asiatic
cholera, it was Lyon, and yet it escaped the visitations of this exotic Asiatic
outsider. Well, what was Pettenkofer&#39;s theory? And it was his delight to
believe that he could provide an apparently clear, epidemiologically-based
explanation for all of those cholera mysteries. Indeed, another aspect of his
theory--that Robert Koch discovered the <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. You&#39;ve seen a
picture of the <i>Vibrio</i>. And he discovered it in 1883.</p>
<p>Pettenkofer didn&#39;t
reject the idea of the <i>Vibrio</i>. Instead, he incorporated it elegantly
into his larger theory, explaining that it played a role in the etiology of
cholera, but that its role and its mechanism were completely different from the
ones that Koch espoused. Pettenkofer&#39;s theory is often referred to as the
groundwater theory. We&#39;ve seen it can be called localism. It can be called
the groundwater theory. The simplest approach to his method is a very simple
mathematical equation, that he was very fond of himself, for illustrative
purposes. </p>
<p>It was perhaps the
simplest of all mathematical formulas: X + Y = Z. What did that mean to Max
van Pettenkofer? Well, for him, Z was a cholera outbreak, the result then of
combining X and Y. It&#39;s produced, in other words, under certain specific
conditions of two other factors, the X factor and the Y factor. The X factor,
he said, was the presence of the <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. You see, he accepts
that the <i>Vibrio</i> plays a role. But for Pettenkofer, the <i>Vibrio</i>
itself, on its own, would never make you sick. You could swallow it quite
safely and remain entirely healthy. He regarded it as harmless on its own, and
as we&#39;ll see in a moment, he carried out a famous auto-experiment in which he
tried to demonstrate conclusively the truth of his view. In other words, he
made himself a cocktail of the <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and drank it, and, in
fact, he remained healthy, and therefore persuaded, to the end of his life,
that the <i>Vibrio</i> on its own was harmless. </p>
<p>He was to say that
the <i>Vibrio</i> causes disease in an entirely different, but orthodox,
miasmatic manner. The danger doesn&#39;t arise when the <i>Vibrio</i> contaminates
food and drinking water. The problem is different. It happens when the <i>Vibrio</i>
gets into the soil beneath a major city. And there, Pettenkofer used a
horticultural analogy, referring to germination or fermentation. After the <i>Vibrio</i>
gained access to the soil, under certain conditions it could germinate like a
plant and give off its poison into the air above, that the population inhaled,
and those who were susceptible fell ill in large numbers, and it was then that
you&#39;d have the onset of an epidemic. In nineteenth-century medical parlance,
cholera was an example of a whole category of diseases that were called zymotic
diseases, diseases caused by fermentation. So that we see the X factor
involves the <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Then the Y factor was simply those local
conditions--again localism--that were necessary for fermentation to take place,
and for poison to be given off into the atmosphere. </p>
<p>What makes up the Y
factor? Again let&#39;s think of horticulture and the growth of a plant. A plant
doesn&#39;t need only soil to develop, it also needs nutrients and fertilizer. And
here was the critical role of filth and excrement. They were, in Pettenkofer&#39;s
mind, the nutrients for this plant, the <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Unsanitary
urban conditions literally fed the <i>Vibrio</i>. Sewage was dangerous, not
because it got into the water, but because it seeped into the soil beneath the
city, nourishing the <i>Vibrio</i> and giving rise to fermentation. But
there&#39;s more to it, in Pettenkofer&#39;s epidemiology. </p>
<p>Like a plant,
fermentation required a number of other preconditions. It needed water; plants
always need water. It needed a warm temperature. It needed air and porous
soil in which to grow. And it was at this point that we see why Pettenkofer&#39;s
theory is sometimes called the groundwater theory. Groundwater was important
to his analysis because he considered variations in the water table beneath the
city to be a measure of the capacity of a soil beneath the city to support
fermentation and give rise to cholera epidemics. Too high a water table would
be like flooding, and that would kill the plant. Too low a table would be like
a drought or a desert. </p>
<p>So, for a cholera
epidemic, the ideal was an ebbing water table that left moist, porous soil
above it; a condition that was likely to be characteristic of the early
summer. And indeed, Pettenkofer now thought he understood the seasonality of
cholera. He could explain its seasonality by reference to the water table of
European and other cities. Armed with this theory, Pettenkofer proceeded to
conduct exhaustive epidemiological studies of the local conditions of
localities vulnerable to cholera. For Pettenkofer, it seemed obvious why
mountainous areas--the Alps, for example--weren&#39;t afflicted with cholera.
There, there was such a deep layer of insulation between the groundwater and
the population, who were therefore protected from the cholera poison.
Similarly, desert areas provided no conditions for fermentation. </p>
<p>Pettenkofer also
thought that he had solved the Lyon problem. By investigating and studying
Lyon, he realized that it was built on a thick layer of impenetrable granite.
It was built on stone, and therefore provided no opportunity for fermentation
and germination. The best conditions were provided by cities that were built
at sea level, on alluvial, porous soil. This could explain why Naples was
ravaged, Paris, London, Calcutta. And then he decided, being an honest
scientist, that he should also investigate, in particular, the hard case, the
one that seemed to conflict with his theories, and that was the Island of
Malta. Malta was built on rock, but it experienced disaster during recurring
cholera pandemics, and he thought, to his own satisfaction, that he could solve
the riddle. Malta, unlike Lyon, was not built on impermeable granite. It had
everything to do with the specifics of the stone itself. Malta was built on
porous, soft limestone, and that provided infinite air-filled cavities, that if
watered and fertilized, in warm conditions, would provide wonderful places for
germination. </p>
<p>You can see
Pettenkofer visiting Malta, which he did, and having his eureka moment. He did
core samples. I&#39;m trying to say that Pettenkofer was a very conscientious
research scientist, and a strong epidemiologist. And he went further. He
argued also that he could explain not only which cities were most afflicted by
cholera, but also the very neighborhoods within them. Low-lying areas, close
to the water table, would be vulnerable to cholera. Neighborhoods built on
hills would be protected. Naples was a good example. The Lower City was
ravaged, the Upper City was not, and Pettenkofer thought he knew why.
Neapolitans, as you know, in fact agreed with him, and Pettenkofer&#39;s theories
were much admired there. It seemed to explain Neapolitan history, and it was
his theories that were the very basis for the rebuilding project. </p>
<p>He saw his great
achievement as that of developing a single unified theory, with no internal
contradictions, that could explain all the known facts of cholera, and clarify
those puzzling cholera mysteries. Now, an interesting point about
Pettenkofer&#39;s theories. They&#39;re now rejected by modern science. But during
the nineteenth century, they provided a major impetus to undertake needed
sanitary reform. His ideas therefore can be credited probably with saving
hundreds of thousands of lives, from a variety of diarrheal illnesses; cholera,
of course, but also typhoid, gastroenteritis. </p>
<p>So, this is a case of
an idea that we now know not to be robust scientifically, that nevertheless
produced very practical results that had a major impact on combating epidemic
diseases. Pettenkofer was responsible, in fact, for bringing the sanitary idea
to Bavaria. He wanted to install sewer systems to take away waste and fecal
matter, but not for the reason that Snow would have. He wasn&#39;t worried that
Bavarians would drink infected water, or eat contaminated food. He was afraid
that the fecal matter would get beneath the city and would nourish the <i>Vibrio</i>,
and thereby give rise to poisonous fumes that would poison the people. His
idea was to make the soil of Germany&#39;s cities infertile, and you could do that
by depriving the soil of organic matter and excrement. So, he wanted to supply
Germany with clean water. But not specifically clean drinking water, but he
wanted to prevent sewage from gaining access to the groundwater and the soil
beneath the city. </p>
<p>He also championed
the idea of sand filtration of water, to ensure clean water. He thought that
Snow had been seriously misled. There was a matter of proportion here. Snow,
he said, was really concentrated on the few liters that a person consumed.
That water, he argued, no matter how contaminated, would actually do no harm.
The real issue was the massive quantity of water, of domestic, industrial or
household waste, that carried fertilizer to the city soil, and there dread
disease. Now, Pettenkofer recognized then that clean water and effective
sewage, and waste disposal, were essential public health measures. So, he
had--as his legacy, Pettenkofer was the founder of the sanitary movement in
Germany. He was also a professor of hygiene at the University of Munich.</p>
<p>He founded a journal
called <i>The Archive for Hygiene</i>, in 1883; and indeed it&#39;s still published
as <i>The International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health</i>. He
was the founder of the Max van Pettenkofer Institute in Munich, a world-famous
research institute, dedicated to the promotion of public health. He became its
director, and trained people. It became a center of research and training,
unique at its time. He was an important figure in the founding of the Johns
Hopkins School of Public Health. And along with his opponent, John Snow, he
was a founding father in the field of epidemiology. </p>
<p>His arguments, though
now largely discredited, were supported by prodigious fieldwork. You can
imagine him going around Europe, taking core samples of soil and rock, and
correlating that with measurements of the rise and fall of groundwater levels,
and correlating all of that information with rainfall, temperature
measurements, and the history of cholera outbreaks. And Pettenkofer was
tireless in propagating his ideas as a lecturer, as a writer. He was an
advisor to the Bavarian government, and he became president of the Bavarian
Academy of Science. </p>
<p>Another factor was
that Pettenkofer was quite interested in something else as well: what made
people susceptible? And he believed that poor nutrition was an important
factor in that. So, his public health policies also involved attention to diet
and nutrition. Of course, some of his recommendations were misguided. But one
measure he gave great attention to was also the siting of infectious disease
hospitals and cemeteries. A cholera hospital, or a cemetery, should be located
on a hilltop, far from the city center and downwind of it. That would prevent
the cholera germ from percolating down easily into the soil beneath the city,
and would ensure that any poisonous miasma that arose would be dispersed from
the population. We can see that he helped the way--condition---the way Naples,
for example, was rebuilt, and where the infectious diseases hospital in that
city was located; which was high above the city and downwind from it. </p>
<p>And as I said, to
prove his theory, he tried his dangerous auto-experiment. His theory was
losing ground by 1892, when there was a major epidemic of cholera at Hamburg,
in Germany, and Pettenkofer and Robert Koch were greatly at odds. To prove his
case, Pettenkofer challenged Koch to provide him with a cholera cocktail, that
he volunteered to swallow. Koch&#39;s collaborator, Gaffke, duly dispatched a vial
filled with <i>Vibrio.</i> There&#39;s some interesting ethical issues here, as Gaffke
sent Pettenkofer what he thought was a fatal dose of cholera, and fully
expected Pettenkofer to die an agonizing death. There are then various
accounts of what happened next. </p>
<p>One account has it
that Pettenkofer&#39;s lab assistants intercepted the package and diluted the
dose. It&#39;s also true that the cholera cocktail was sent in February, and it
may well be that the cold temperature in transit attenuated the virulence of
the <i>Vibrio.</i> In any case, Pettenkofer was a man convinced of his theory.
He put his life on the line to prove it, and he duly swallowed the vial that
Koch&#39;s lab had provided. He fell seriously ill of diarrhea, but didn&#39;t develop
the symptoms he recognized as Asiatic cholera. He rapidly recovered, and was
convinced that he&#39;d proved that the <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> does not directly
cause the disease, not by being ingested. </p>
<p>Well, there was an
unhappy sequel for Pettenkofer. Koch&#39;s microbiology, by the 1890s, convinced
the medical world of the germ theory, and miasmatic doctrine of all kinds,
including Pettenkoffer&#39;s own, were discredited. In 1894, he resigned his
university chair. In 1899, he resigned from his other offices. In the 1890s
also, three of his five children died, and his wife. And on February 9<sup>th</sup>,
1901, Pettenkofer committed suicide. </p>
<p>Well, there&#39;s a final
aspect I&#39;d like to raise in my last minute, and that is to say the defeat of
anti-contagionism may have had some negative legacies, that it took time to
recognize. One of the strengths of Pettenkofer&#39;s ideas was the stress they put
on what we would now call the environmental, social and economic determinants
of disease. For a time, the germ theory of disease relegated those aspects of
medicine to the background, leading to a narrow-gauge stress on microbes, and
the attempt to find magic bullets to destroy them.</p>
<p>So, Pettenkofer then
was ultimately wrong. But I would argue that his ideas were magnificently wrong,
and that they contained important elements of truth, and important and vital
measures for public health and for medicine. Next time, we&#39;ll take the high
road and move on to the victors in this debate--Pasteur, Koch, Lister--and the
successful proof of the truth of contagionism and the germ theory of disease.
But I thought you needed a moment with Max von. </p>
