<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
I wanted to begin with just a housekeeping item, which is that next Monday
we&#39;ll have the last class, if you want to call it that, but it will be completely
different in that it will be a review session. I&#39;ll elaborate on what format
that might take. But essentially I&#39;ll be--there won&#39;t be anything that I&#39;m
planning to lecture about. On the contrary, it will be your opportunity to
raise questions or make comments on any aspects of the material that you wish
to discuss more. The format will be that there&#39;ll be a microphone, and you&#39;ll
come up and use it and ask questions, and then we&#39;ll discuss anything that you
wish. It will really be--I&#39;ll be in your hands, and that will be a class that
would be helpful if you came with things that you wanted to discuss or things
that you think that we should go into more. So, that will be what we&#39;ll do on
Monday. </p>
<p>For today, instead,
we&#39;re going to talk about three, in fact, new diseases, that demonstrated once
more that the post-World War II idea, the complacent assumption, that modern
medical science and public health had the tools to protect society and to
eradicate diseases one by one, when that illusion, fostered by the example of
smallpox, and nearly by the near eradication of polio, was once again
punctured, as it had been earlier by the emergence of HIV/AIDS. Most of all it
showed that our society is still vulnerable, particularly to respiratory
infections in the industrial world, transmitted by air or droplets. They&#39;re
true diseases of globalization and modernity, that thrive on high population
density and modern means of high-speed communication. </p>
<p>I want to end our
semester by talking about SARS, avian flu and swine flu, and some of the
lessons we&#39;ve learned from those experiences. I would regard them as the first
new diseases of the twenty-first century, and also as our great dress rehearsals
for something much more serious, that may or may not come later. Once again, I
don&#39;t want to make a prediction. So let&#39;s begin with SARS, the first great
dress rehearsal of the twentieth century. As you know or remember, it began in
November 2002 with an index case from someone from the Guangdong Province in
Southern China, a severe and unusual pneumonia. </p>
<p>What took place then
in China was not something that was extraordinary, as our press tried to
persuade us. Rather, it was something that&#39;s happened many times, the
emergence of a new pathogen previously unknown. Only in the sixties and seventies
was there a boundless optimism about the capacity of modern medicine to prevent
that from happening again. Once again we were reminded that the natural world
isn&#39;t static but in a state of constant Darwinian evolution, with the
consequence that there are always and inevitably new and emerging diseases.
And viruses, as you know, are especially capable of sudden, rapid mutation. </p>
<p>Well, the media did
us a disservice at the outset of SARS with sensationalizing headlines attempting
to stir up fear; examples being, &quot;Is This the Big One?,&quot; &quot;Killer Bug,&quot; and the
like. The Chinese authorities, in their response to SARS, practiced a
conspiracy of silence at the outset, producing no reports or statistics, and
censoring the press. I&#39;m hoping that this will remind you--what happened in
China--that also concealment isn&#39;t something we haven&#39;t encountered before, and
it will remind you of other examples of public health by concealment. </p>
<p>Now, why, we might
speculate, did the Chinese decide to conceal this outbreak? First, we could
say, would be the fear of economic repercussions. The world economy at the
time was already stagnant, and there were fears of the implications for
vulnerable sectors: travel, tourism, investment. There was a matter of
national pride. The World Health Organization had already produced a report
ranking world healthcare systems, and China had ranked one hundred and
forty-fourth, just below Bangladesh. So, a medical emergency could cast a new
and harsh light on Chinese public health. It&#39;s also probably true that
authoritarian political systems have people who man the apparatus, whose career
depends on producing good news. We might also point to what we might call an
authoritarian paternalism; the idea of sparing the population anxiety and
avoiding giving rise to challenges to the state and its priorities. </p>
<p>In any case, and
whatever the reasons, China placed the health of its own citizens at risk by
failing to enable them to make informed decisions about their own health. And
it took the risk also of allowing the new disease to threaten the international
community, delaying the process of patient detective work that&#39;s required to
unravel the secrets of this new infection. Finally, on the ninth of February, the
Chinese Ministry of Health notified the World Health Organization of some three
hundred and five cases in six municipalities in Southern China. This too was a
serious underestimate, and it was followed by weeks of tardy release of dubious
statistics that were meant still to be reassuring. </p>
<p>So, for weeks the
World Health Organization wasn&#39;t allowed to send teams of researchers to
investigate the disturbing events in China. The pathogen, which is this one,
was unknown at the time of the outbreak; was now known to be a previously
unencountered coronavirus. Its structure was--a schematic picture of it would
be that. Its early names--what to call it? It was called human
pneumonia-associated coronavirus. Because of one of its early victims, it was
called the Urbani virus. But the name that stuck was SARS, Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s follow our
usual procedure and look at the symptoms and the epidemiology, and some of the
effects on society of the SARS outbreak. In terms of symptoms, the disease was
first identified and defined by Dr. Carlo Urbani, a forty-six-year-old
infectious disease expert for the WHO, who was working at Hanoi, and was one of
the early physicians to encounter the disease. He contracted it and died soon
after. The symptoms were an incubation period of about a week--five to ten
days or so--followed by a sudden onset of fever--about a hundred degrees, a
hundred and one-general malaise, headache, muscle pain, dizziness, sore
throat. </p>
<p>Three to seven days
later the majority of cases improved spontaneously, with no lasting ill
effect. But a minority of cases worsened at that very point, with lower
respiratory involvement, and this led to a hacking, non-productive cough,
terrible shortness of breath and chest pain. It&#39;s worth remembering that the
disease at this stage was thoroughly unpleasant. A Toronto nurse, suffering
from SARS, was interviewed by phone from her hospital room, and she said that
the cough she was experiencing was so violent that she turned blue, and it caused
her to fall to her knees. In a minority of cases there was a progress to very
severe respiratory distress, requiring oxygen and mechanical support. X-rays
revealed what was called atypical pneumonia, which was a somewhat confusing
term because it had been used, until that time, for a different condition. </p>
<p>On the seventh of May
2003, the World Health Organization suggested that SARS had a case fatality
rate of about fifteen percent or so. There was no known specific treatment,
and patients were given broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals, but they
weren&#39;t very effective, and treatment was really symptomatic and supportive.
What about transmission? The dominant mode for transmitting SARS was clearly
face-to-face contact, droplets from coughing or sneezing, and the droplets that
were inhaled were the contaminated objects--that is, fomites--and a person
touching them and then bringing the hand to the mouth could ingest the virus. </p>
<p>This mode of
transmission was encouraging for public health because it meant that the
disease required prolonged contact at close range, and was much less contagious
than say the Spanish influenza, smallpox or pneumonic plague. And the dominant
pattern of the epidemic was for SARS to spread in tight clusters of people, closely
gathered around a patient: healthcare personnel, their family members, hospital
visitors, guests on the same floor of a hotel, or residents of the same wing of
an urban tenement dwelling. And the disease, like airborne viral infections in
general, seems to be an equal opportunity affliction that can pass to all
classes of society, the young, the old, the healthy and those with preexisting
conditions. But there also was some evidence, although it mostly remained
confined to the hospital environment, at least outside of China, it could
spread to communities. </p>
<p>There were
speculations during the outbreak of people who were called
super-spreaders--sort of viral Typhoid Marys, was the image--who were unusually
virulent and who shed viruses inhaled at a greater distance; perhaps through
the air-conditioning system of a hotel, or the circulating air of an airplane.
There was speculation that sometimes it could spread through the fecal-oral
route, or through asymptomatic carriers. In any case, the disease spread from
Southern China and Guangdong Dong Province to its next epicenter, which was
Hong Kong; which was particularly important because of population density and
mass air travel, Hong Kong being one of the great hubs of the international air
travel network. </p>
<p>It&#39;s important noting
too that Hong Kong had intense, constant links with neighboring southern
China. In sheer size it had some 6 million people and was known as one of the
most densely crowded cities on earth, and possessed the busiest airport in
Asia. The first outbreak was at the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong, and then
very rapidly thereafter the Prince of Wales Hospital. The disease, at the
initial cases, wasn&#39;t really recognized and no special precautionary measures
were taken, though the hospital and the hotel soon became world famous as the
first foci of infection outside of Guangdong Dong Province. The people
afflicted early on were doctors, nurses, orderlies, attendants, hospital
visitors and a couple of guests at the hotel. </p>
<p>So, Hong Kong became
the second world epicenter, and the disease spread from there, using air travel
as its means. It went to three places particularly. First was to Hanoi in
Vietnam, then to Singapore, and then on to this continent, to Toronto. It
struck Toronto through a seventy-eight-year-old immigrant from Hong Kong who&#39;d
been staying at the Metropole Hotel, before returning to Toronto. She was
hospitalized and died in the Scarborough Hospital in Toronto. There was soon a
joke about SARS; that is to say, &quot;Are you worried about terrorists?&quot;
&quot;No, we&#39;re worried about Canadians.&quot; </p>
<p>In any case, what
were the public health measures that were adopted? The first thing to note is
that--I&#39;ve said this was a great dress-rehearsal, and it was a transformative
event; although we&#39;re going to see that all of these three pandemics that we
discuss this morning were relatively limited in terms of their impact, they are
really important for our consideration because they mark a real change in
public health. One of the factors was that SARS led to an unprecedented
coordination of international public health responses. What happened was
really extraordinary, as Julie Gerberding, the director of the CDC, pointed
out, saying that this was &quot;a monumental international transformation.&quot;
</p>
<p>What happened on the twelfth
of March, the World Health Organization issued a global alert; by the fifteenth,
a travel advisory; and thereafter some eleven laboratories in nineteen
countries were linked electronically, as they shared all information in real time,
hunting for the pathogen. They began genetic sequencing, and began work
attempting to find a vaccine and a reliable diagnostic test. The result was
success in world record time. On April 16<sup>th</sup>, the World Health
Organization Laboratory Network announced that it had identified the pathogen
responsible for SARS. By the twenty-sixth of March, there was the beginning of
electronic grand rounds, in which the internet was used to bring together
eighty clinicians from thirteen countries, to share information on the care and
maintenance of SARS patients. Those were novel features. </p>
<p>In addition, there
were some traditional measures that were taken, that constitute in part a
review of things that you&#39;re already well familiar with. A team of World Health
Organization epidemiologists began investigating the epidemic in Southern China
and its outward spread. Some airports began to quarantine people who arrived.
They took their temperatures, examined them for symptoms, and gave them
advisory cards with information on what to do if they fell ill. Hospitals set
up isolation wards, with a capacity to contain air, and with barrier protection
for hospital personnel: double gowns, facemasks, goggles, gloves, hand
disinfection, changes of shoes. </p>
<p>In affected areas,
there was the rigorous tracking of all contacts of known cases. There was
quarantine, in some places, even house arrests, with video cameras, unannounced
police visits, sanctions, fines, and all the rest. And you might like to know
that the <i>Toronto Star</i> also recommended reading material for those in
quarantine, and it looked a little bit like something that might be a reading
list for our course. That is, the most popular book for the SARS patients,
you&#39;ll all be glad to know, was Daniel Defoe, <i>Journal of a Plague Year</i>.
And they also read Camus and Boccaccio, in their quarantine in Toronto. </p>
<p>There was public
information in the media and on the web, enabling citizens to make rational
public health choices. There was compulsory masking, the closing of schools,
cancellation of sports events and other large gatherings of people. All of
those were measures that were fairly traditional. So, what&#39;s striking is a
kind of contrast. On the one hand, the high-tech end, working out the biology
and epidemiology of SARS, with extraordinary rapid, efficient and high-tech
interventions. On the other hand, public health measures and treatment were
rather old-fashioned, low-tech and traditional. But the public health measures
were effective. </p>
<p>By mid-May there were
signs that the outbreaks were retreating and being successfully contained in
healthcare settings. By June 18<sup>th</sup>, as the global epidemic reached
its hundredth day, the number of cases was down to a handful. On the fifth of
July, the World Health Organization announced that SARS had been controlled
worldwide. The total, by the end, was something like 8,000 cases and a few
hundred deaths. Nonetheless, the passage of this marked a transformation, as I
said, in international public health interconnectedness. It also left behind
it important effects on communities. </p>
<p>Hong Kong was
described as a ghost town. Its shops, restaurants, theaters, churches, public
health transport were all deserted and many closed. Communion wasn&#39;t
administered in churches, and daily life was transformed for those in
quarantine, and for healthcare personnel. A joke circulated in Hong Kong that
if you wanted space to yourself, all you had to do was sneeze and you&#39;d
immediately be left alone. </p>
<p>There was economic
impact, the collapse of tourism and the retail industry. One estimate was that
some ten billion dollars were lost in Asia because of the impact of SARS, with
knock-on effects on unemployment and fragile economic growth. Toronto, this
epicenter in North America, was less severely affected. But there were things
there too that remind us of parts of our course, that you now know very well.
There were reports in the city that it was being seized by a SARS panic, a
stigmatization of victims and scapegoating. A nurse, who had been hospitalized
and later interviewed in the press, reported that a crowd had gathered outside
her home and stoned it. There was, in the Canadian press, a series of reports
on what was called SARS racism, particularly in Chinatown, and children of
Asian origin were bullied in school, and Asian Canadians were shunned in
public. Toronto also spawned reports of a general fear. </p>
<p>Polls show that sixty
percent of Canadians were worried or very worried about contracting SARS. And
even places not touched by the disease experienced some ripple shock effects.
Los Angeles and San Francisco had--people reported that surgical masks had been
sold out. ERs and primary care physicians were overwhelmed with people with
coughs and the common cold. Chinese restaurants and Chinatowns in the United
Sates, in various cities, were deserted, and Health Canada reported an outbreak
of what it termed &quot;SARS racism against the Asian community.&quot; So, the
experience of SARS was the first dress rehearsal of the twenty-first century
for emerging diseases. And I think it showed that the world community was
still vulnerable, especially to airborne diseases.</p>
<p>SARS tested the
preparedness of public health and the preparedness of political authorities.
On the positive side, it revealed and stimulated an extraordinary technical and
scientific capacity, in interlocking laboratories that identified the pathogen,
and in the ground rounds in cyberspace. But I would argue that there wasn&#39;t
really room for complacency. The world was lucky and dodged a bullet with
SARS, for a variety of fortuitous circumstances. The disease spread by
droplets isn&#39;t really very readily transmissible. The chronology was
fortunate. The disease began to spread globally in the spring; which, as you
know, is normally the beginning of the end of the flu season. And there was
serendipity. The disease spread to Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto, and those
are all places of highly developed healthcare systems and resources making
containment possible. </p>
<p>One wonders what the
result might have been had the earlier travelers, who spread SARS, gone to
different destinations in resource-poor Third World cities. So, that was the
first dress rehearsal. The second followed fairly quickly after, and this was
avian influenza, H5N1, which was a new or emerging epizootic. It was first
isolated in 1996, but began as a disease of waterfowl in Southeast Asia in
mid-2003. Early cases were mostly undetected and unreported. There then
followed three small waves of this influenza outbreak, beginning in December
2003/January 2004 in Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Cambodia, Indonesia, first among
susceptible birds. It spread rapidly and affected their internal organs with a
mortality rate of nearly a hundred percent. And this was one of the great
global epizootics, with tens of millions of wild birds perishing. </p>
<p>Then H5N1
demonstrated that it was capable of transmission to human beings who came into
contact with infected poultry: butchers, people who raised live poultry or live
in close contact with them. This is--that&#39;s the masking from SARS, but I
wanted to show you someone at risk during the epidemic of avian flu. Then
there were human cases that began a second detected wave in June and July 2004
that ended in November 2004, and a third wave beginning in December of 2004,
again in Southeast Asia. Once again, if we look at--I wanted to show you a few
cases of humor generated by the avian flu. Here we see a person saying that
they&#39;re safe at last, but in fact they weren&#39;t really. Then there&#39;s this one,
which might take you a second to see what&#39;s happened to our friend Donald
Duck. </p>
<p>I think it&#39;s worth
knowing that epidemic diseases sometimes also generate a human response. And
then there&#39;s this one, that I was particularly fond of, which is your flock of
geese and of poultry, with one sneezing in the back, and someone in the front
saying, &quot;Very funny.&quot; In any case, the spread was by migratory birds
in flight, but also by the great trade routes of the poultry industry, the
trade in chickens, in feathers, in chicken parts for use as feed, chicken
excrement for use as fertilizer. Once again, the world was fortunate in that
avian flu didn&#39;t spread readily among human beings. </p>
<p>We then experienced
our third rehearsal for the twenty-first century, and this was swine flu, that
all of you know, H1N1. It first appeared in Mexico in March/April of 2009, as
far as is known, then swept the globe and isn&#39;t in fact--hasn&#39;t entirely ebbed,
as we meet this morning. Thus far, however, apart from the early phase of the
disease in Mexico, where it was fairly--it was fairly serious in Mexico--it&#39;s
been elsewhere a widespread, relatively mild disease, that&#39;s infected millions
and millions of people, but with a strictly limited mortality; a mortality less
even than seasonal influenza. But we need to remember that we don&#39;t know the
end of this story yet. </p>
<p>Viruses for influenza
are highly unstable and capable of mutating, and so it could achieve still a
greater virulence. And we know from previous outbreaks of influenza that it
could return in future waves. Often a pattern of influenza outbreaks has been
to have a series of waves. We don&#39;t know what will happen with the swine flu.
This was the first epidemic disease, however--and this was a major transformation
in public health--to appear after the entry into force of the new international
health regulations of 2005 that were signed by one hundred and ninety four
nations, including all members of the World Health Organization. </p>
<p>Those regulations
were intended to provide rapid international response to public health
threats. And in particular the old regulations had declared that there needed
to be reporting only for diseases that were already known. It seemed to assume
a static world, without the emergence of new diseases. The new regulations took
that into account and called for compulsory reporting of disease events; of
known diseases but also new ones, new public health threats. The new
regulations then required reporting. They standardized and improved
international surveillance, and they allowed World Health Organization
intervention through regularized procedures. And they played, the new
regulations, an important role in the unfolding pandemic. </p>
<p>Indeed, the
coordination of the international response to swine flu, at every level, was
one of the most encouraging lessons of this particular pandemic, along with the
speed with which a vaccine was developed and distributed, along with antiviral
medications. But once again, there was no real place for complacency. It was
true--and this was a worrying sign--that the disease took the world public
health community by surprise. The ruling dogma in matters of influenza was
that the next threat would emerge in the Far East, and it was there that surveillance
was concentrated. But this was a pandemic that surprised everyone by breaking
out first of all in Mexico, and it did so at a time that no one was expecting,
in the spring rather than in the early fall or winter, as influenza normally
does. </p>
<p>The crisis also
exposed a lack of capacity in the public health system, limited surge capacity
in terms of hospital beds or caregivers. There was an ongoing public distrust
of vaccination as something dangerous. It also showed the capacity of airborne
respiratory disease to emerge without warning, and to spread rapidly across the
globe, before vaccines could be developed to contain them. And as in the case
of SARS and avian flu, so too H1H1 showed that the world community was
fortunate, because this turned out really to be a dress rehearsal in that the
pathogen had a very limited virulence. </p>
<p>So, as a society, how
prepared were we? Once a pandemic strain appeared, it took quite a bit of
time. I think we should say that neither doomsday pessimism nor complacency
are rational. The threat is real. But pessimism is also unrealistic, and
there are many steps that could be taken to contain the threat. The SARS
lesson showed us that virologists can now be instantly linked via the web
around the globe, and that clinicians can exchange information on patient care
in the same manner. SARS was epoch-making in this organized response, and this
process was strengthened through avian flu and swine flu. </p>
<p>Especially important,
as I&#39;ve said, was the entry into force of the new set of international health
regulations, and individual communities and countries now put into place
advance planning, after SARS, with procedures before the next emergency.
Globalization, in other words, was not only a health risk, but also a resource.
And you can see the difference right here on our campus. SARS, I would argue,
caught Yale unprepared, and the result was confusion, fear and delay. By the
time of the swine flu outbreak, however, the lesson had been learned, and it
was very impressive to note that this time around there was a coherent
strategy; that everyone was kept informed throughout the course of events. And
perhaps the only worrying aspect was something that wasn&#39;t our community&#39;s
fault but a sobering global issue. </p>
<p>It was worth
remembering that last fall, at the height of the swine outbreak, vaccines
arrived just as the disease was moving on from the State of Connecticut. In
any case, in the absence of an effective therapy or prophylactic, for patients
supportive care and nursing are crucial considerations, and one could argue
that perhaps for-profit medicine has squeezed the surge capacity out of our
system, and radically reduced the ratio of nurses to patients. There was also
a crucially important factor, which was the race to develop a vaccine. And
here, to cultivate the virus--in the case, for example, of SARS--massive
numbers of--or avian flu--what was discovered was the need for massive numbers
of hen eggs. And, so, the poultry industry should perhaps have been declared of
crucial importance, because the hens themselves were needed for the vaccine,
but would perish in crippling numbers in the event of the avian flu going
further. </p>
<p>Communities also
learned that they could plan their response in advance; that they could take
measures to educate about coughing/sneezing etiquette, hand sanitizing, the
danger of fomites, the utility of masking, and the utility of avoiding
assemblies of people and, as far as possible, to isolate themselves during the
outbreak, and the importance of information to prevent the spread of panic. So,
I would argue that these three dress-rehearsals, for the twenty-first century,
had major--although all three were in terms of their impact as diseases, they
were very limited. The world was fortunate in that respect. They revealed
important vulnerabilities, but they also provoked a new organization of
response through laboratories; a new coordination of the public health
community; new awareness of the need rapidly to distribute antivirals and
vaccines; and they taught the necessity of preparation in advance for the next
outbreak. </p>
<p>I would say that the
world moved on enormously as a result of SARS, of avian flu and swine flu. But
I would argue that emerging diseases are an inherent part of the human condition,
nothing totally to be thought of as unexpected or strange. And if I were to
make just one prediction, I would expect that there would be more, and that the
systems set in place and improved by SARS, avian flu and swine flu will be
tested again in our new century. And with that I&#39;ll stop. And we&#39;ll gather
again on Monday for a review session of everything that we&#39;ve covered in our
course. So, the review should include everything from the beginning, down
through the very end. It&#39;s not meant to be limited just to the first half, but
to the whole of the semester. </p>
