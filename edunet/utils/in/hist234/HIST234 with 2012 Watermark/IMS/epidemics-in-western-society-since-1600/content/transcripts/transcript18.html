<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Good morning. Our topic for this time, and next, is another of the really
ancient diseases in our course, which is tuberculosis. Tuberculosis was present
in Ancient Egypt. This is known from skeletons and from mummies. And it seems
that tuberculosis has been with human beings ever since they first began to
gather in substantial settlements, which are essential for its transmission, in
ways we&#39;ll be discussing. It was present in Ancient Greece, and in Rome, and
Hippocrates and Galen clearly knew patients suffering from tuberculosis. It
persisted in the Middle Ages. So, we&#39;re dealing not with a new but a very
ancient disease. </p>
<p>A question that
you&#39;ll be asking is whether indeed it&#39;s an epidemic disease; would it perhaps
be better to describe it as endemic? And this again, I think, as when we dealt
with malaria, we see that some diseases are both endemic and epidemic, and I
think this applies to tuberculosis as well. One way of thinking of it might be
in terms of its time frame. If you look at any single generation, it often
seems that tuberculosis isn&#39;t an epidemic disease. It&#39;s present, after all,
year after year. It is contagious but it spreads slowly from person to
person. Its course in the individual body of a patient is often very slow and
capricious. </p>
<p>It&#39;s clearly
different from bubonic plague, from influenza or Asiatic cholera. But if you
take a long-term perspective, it might seem that tuberculosis does ebb and
flow, like an epidemic disease. Perhaps one could think of it in terms of an
epidemic that lasts for centuries, perhaps, or decades in the case of a body of
a single patient, at times. In a sense, one could say that tuberculosis could
be an epidemic disease in slow motion. Our concern will be with Europe and
North America, at a time of a vast upsurge--and here I&#39;m referring to Western
Europe--that coincided with the Industrial Revolution. Here there are a number
of factors that lie in the background that contributed, probably. One is a
large-scale pace of urbanization, and we&#39;ll see the impact of crowded housing
and poor ventilation, which are decisive factors, particularly in the case of a
disease that&#39;s a pulmonary disease, above all. </p>
<p>The rise of
sweatshops and the factory system again led to crowding, this time not in the
home but in the workplace, and poor ventilation now during the day, as well as
in the home at night. I&#39;m thinking of low wages, and with that poor diet and a
compromised immune system. Another factor that&#39;s very important for diseases
that are respiratory is pollution of the atmosphere, and the smog in cities
like London due to soot from the burning of coal, or particles due to tobacco
from smoking, or again particles in mineshafts, or unhygienic workshops, all
made their contribution. </p>
<p>In any case, it&#39;s not
by chance that England, the first industrial nation, experienced an epidemic
wave that crested between the middle of the eighteenth century and the middle
of the nineteenth. And then in the case of England, there was a slow, steady
decline from the later decades of the nineteenth century. And we can see this
as well taking place in countries that industrialized a little bit later, say
France, Germany, Italy, Russia. The upsurge began later, but did so
remorselessly. And then a decline set in, but again slightly later, from the
beginning of the twentieth century. </p>
<p>If you look at the
geography of tuberculosis in Europe, it would also support this idea of a clear
relationship between tuberculosis as a condition, and the conditions created by
industrial development; especially in its traumatic early phases. Tuberculosis
was a major killer in the northern industrial nations--Britain, Germany and
France--and it was less prevalent in less industrial, largely agricultural
nations, such as Italy and Spain. So, there&#39;s this distinction to be made.
But also if you looked at the pattern of tuberculosis in Italy and Spain, you
would see not only was it less there, but also it respected the distribution of
industrial development. </p>
<p>Take Italy for
example. We already talked, in the case of malaria, about a major north/south
divide. This is also true with regard to tuberculosis, but in reverse.
Tuberculosis, in other words, was an affliction above all of Italy&#39;s northern
cities, and it was much less prevalent in the agricultural south where people
worked outdoors. Well, let&#39;s turn now to the nature of the disease: how it&#39;s
transmitted, its different forms, and its symptomatology in the body. </p>
<p>The pathogen, to
begin with, was first discovered by someone we know well now, in a variety of
contexts, and this is Robert Koch, who discovered it in 1882--the <i>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</i>, which is that. Now, transmission--tuberculosis can be spread
in more than one way, but we&#39;re concerned, and will be concerned, primarily
with its dominant mode of transmission, which is through the air. In other
words, a sufferer from tuberculosis will say cough, sneeze, spit, and give off
airborne droplets, which are then inhaled by other people. </p>
<p>Now, a primary
infection by most people who come into contact with <i>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</i> doesn&#39;t lead on to symptoms, it usually heals. But in those
with compromised immune systems, the disease, as the expression was, is
disseminated. It can then lie dormant for years. As I&#39;ve said, one of the
things about tuberculosis is its enormously capricious quality. Alternatively,
it could produce disease within weeks of the primary infection. <i>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</i> can spread via the bloodstream, or the lymph system, to infect
a variety of organs, and produce lesions in virtually any tissue in the body. </p>
<p>I&#39;ll show you now a
number of images of sufferers from tuberculosis, in various forms. And I&#39;m
hoping that these images won&#39;t be overly distressing to anyone. First, this is
scrofula, sometimes called the &quot;King&#39;s Evil,&quot; which was--here we have scrofula
of the neck. There&#39;s tuberculosis of the skin, called <i>Lupus vulgaris</i>.
Tuberculosis can also infect the meninges of the brain, the bone and joints,
the kidneys, the urinary and reproductive system, and can infect the spine,
leading to severe deformity and hunchback. I&#39;ll show you then that form; it&#39;s
called Pott&#39;s Disease. And there&#39;s a skeleton from a sufferer of Pott&#39;s Disease--or
this is what be what it would look like. </p>
<p>The disease can also
affect the lining of the abdominal cavity or the heart. But overwhelmingly,
the most common form of tuberculosis is of the lungs. And this is what we&#39;ll
be dealing with primarily in the course, pulmonary disease, also known as
phthisis or consumption. We&#39;ll mention in passing that tuberculosis is also
spread, and was spread, by meat or milk of infected animals; but that&#39;s a
secondary tragedy within the larger dominant pulmonary form of the disease. </p>
<p>Now, you know from
your reading response questions, and from Barnes&#39; book this week, that
tuberculosis is sometimes referred to as a social disease, and you&#39;ll see in
your in trays that I&#39;ve just sent you an email about social diseases and how we
might think of them. But just for the moment, you&#39;ll note that Barnes doesn&#39;t
define what he means by social disease. By saying that it was a social
disease, he&#39;s arguing that tuberculosis had a predilection for certain social
classes, that it was a disease that was unlike--that it didn&#39;t affect all
classes equally. </p>
<p>Now, note that
cholera, for example, was a disease that didn&#39;t affect all social classes.
Tuberculosis did, in fact, afflict royal families, aristocrats, artists,
writers and professionals, and this was an important factor in the social
response to the disease. Given the mode of transmission, that is, through the
air, it was inevitable that that would be the case. So, even if we do decide
to call tuberculosis a social disease, we need to make major qualifications.
But to focus on the rich and famous is distorting, because out of all
proportion, tuberculosis did, and still, afflicts the poor; especially the
urban poor.</p>
<p>Remember the risk
factors we said: living in cities rather than the countryside; crowded,
unhygienic housing; poor ventilation; workplaces that were similar to those of
the home; child labor en masse; lowered resistance due to poor diet or
pre-existing diseases. Tuberculosis then thrived in slums and tenements, among
industrial workers, and among the inmates of almshouses, prisons, barracks.
Let me give you some illustrations, and we&#39;ll look at some famous pictures. I
think that we have no better ones than the photographs taken by Jacob Riis of
tenements and sweatshops in New York City in the 1880s and nineties, some of
which were collected in his really famous and influential book, <i>How the
Other Half Lives</i>, that was published in 1890. And I&#39;d like to show you
some of the pictures. </p>
<p>This is a slide of a
tenement, an ideal place for tuberculosis. We&#39;ll be looking first at some
pictures of housing, and I&#39;d like you just to make the imaginative leap of
thinking what are the kinds of conditions, if you live in these places, that facilitate
the spread of tuberculosis? Again, this is from Jacob Riis, a tenement in New
York City. Here we see the conditions in which people were sleeping. This is
what was called seven-cent lodgings in an unhappy street, Pell Street, in New
York City. And you can see how tuberculosis would thrive in conditions like
this. But let&#39;s also remember that tuberculosis also thrived because of
conditions at work. And here&#39;s a sweatshop in the Garment District in New York
City, again in the 1890s. Or here again another picture. I think you get the
point. </p>
<p>Remember too that
prison populations, then and now, have been seriously affected with
consumption, because the inmates there have often lived in conditions like
those of tenements, with poor ventilation or lighting, pervasive damp,
overcrowding, inadequate diet, poor sanitation. In conditions like that,
tuberculosis runs riot. Indeed, the <i>New York Times</i> reported, in 1908,
that it was a lie when judges sentenced convicted felons to hard labor. The
truth, the paper reported, was that the sentence should be labeled &quot;to
hard labor and tuberculosis.&quot; </p>
<p>In an inspection in
1905, the New York State Superintendent of Prisons declared that Sing Sing
Prison in particular--and here I&#39;m quoting from the Superintendent of Prisons
of New York State--he called it &quot;a hotbed for the culture and spread of
tuberculosis, that should be abandoned as unfit for human habitation.&quot;
Well, even if a person is infected, as I said, in the vast majority of people
the immune system of the body contains the disease. In the nineteenth century,
say in Paris or Le Havre, probably New York City as well, it&#39;s estimated that
virtually every inhabitant had encountered <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>;
but most remained asymptomatic and non-infectious. An active infection was
promoted by a compromised immune system; let&#39;s say perhaps heredity,
alcoholism, malnutrition, drug abuse, the presence of concurrent infections
that are immunosuppressive. In our own times, one can think of malaria, AIDS
or diabetes as forming a good substratum for tuberculosis. </p>
<p>What are the symptoms
of TB? Well, it&#39;s extremely variable. One of the mysteries of medicine, in
fact, is the course of tuberculosis in the human body. It can be fulminant and
lead to death in months. This is often called galloping consumption, at the
time, or miliary tuberculosis. Alternatively, there can be an onset of
symptoms, followed by recovery or remission, and then a relapse, and instead of
leading to early death, it can lead to a long, chronic illness, often
punctuated by prolonged remissions and equally mysterious relapses. </p>
<p>Before the age of
antibiotics, some eighty-percent of cases were deemed to end fatally, but in a
time span that varied from up to fifteen, twenty years. And in every age there
were spontaneous cures, or apparent cures. Let&#39;s look at two opposite extremes,
two famous cases, the medical careers of two famous nineteenth-century British
writers. The first is John Keats, who lived from 1795 until his death from
tuberculosis in 1821. Note 1821; because he fell ill in February 1820, and
died the next year, at the age of twenty-six, from galloping consumption. </p>
<p>Keats, in fact,
became an icon of the relationship of tuberculosis to the arts and to genius.
An entire century was familiar with the fact that he contracted the disease
while tending his dying brother; that he made a desperate departure from
Britain to Rome in search of health; and it knows, the world knew, at the time
of his death and burial there, after a final period that was widely and
romantically regarded as his most productive and brilliant. His life was
described by romantic writers as that of a meteor, a comet, or a candle that
rapidly burned itself out. And this became a focal point--and Keats himself
did--for the way this disease was construed or socially constructed in the
middle of the nineteenth century as a disease of genius. It was considered to
be a disease of sensibility and civilization. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at the
disease of a different person, whom you all know well. This is Robert Louis
Stevenson, who lived from 1850 to 1894. This is a picture of him in about
1890. Stevenson, unlike Keats, battled tuberculosis for decades. He went in
and out of health spas and sanatoriums. But he led a long and productive life
that was ended, in fact ironically, not by tuberculosis but probably by a
stroke. Now, in the nineteenth century, physicians regarded the course of
pulmonary disease as passing through three stages, as they saw it. But
remember though, before the tuberculin skin test and the development of
radiology, tuberculosis was difficult to diagnose, as the symptoms mimicked
those of other common diseases. And even if the diagnosis was accurate, one
stage merged imperceptibly into another. But for nineteenth century
physicians, there was still this distinction. </p>
<p>The first stage, as
they described it, was marked by a persistent cough, some difficulty in
breathing, especially after exercise. The patient would sweat profusely.
There would be an elevated pulse, pain in the chest and shoulders, general
lassitude, a loss of weight, pallor, declining performance at work or at
school. Then came a second stage when the cough became tormenting and
frequent, and the patient would begin to cough up a greenish phlegm. He or she
would experience intermittent fevers, spiking twice daily, with copious
sweating and a rapid pulse. The patient would suffer from severe fatigability,
from hoarseness that made it difficult and painful to eat or to speak above a
whisper.</p>
<p>There would be
extreme shortness of breath on exertion, pain in the joints of the body. Then
came the third stage of advanced tuberculosis, which gave the most common
nineteenth-century name to the disease: consumption; that is, a frightening
emaciation in which the body wasted away, or seemed to be consumed. The face
would be hollow, the complexion pale. Perhaps this was one of the reasons that
it was called the white plague. The eyes would be sunken in their sockets, and
a patient could easily look like this. </p>
<p>This is a picture of
a consumptive patient in 1892. The cough now seemed like a death rattle, and
the patient would cough blood. There would be constant pain in the joints.
The legs would be swollen. There would be fever, often uncontrollable
diarrhea, and extreme shortness of breath. At that point, the diagnosis was
certain. But at this advanced stage death was imminent, and its form was
unpleasant and painful; often asphyxia, as the patient virtually drowned on the
phlegm in his or her lungs. Or there could be a sudden and unstoppable
hemorrhage, with blood rushing from the mouth and nostrils, and the patient
again suffocating. </p>
<p>Well, what was it
that happened to the lungs? Here&#39;s a modern x-ray slide of a TB patient&#39;s
lungs. And let&#39;s look behind the x-ray at pictures of the lungs. Here is a
set of healthy lungs, hopefully like all of yours. And then I&#39;d like to take
you through the drawings and pictures of the process called cavitation in the
lungs, and the way in which the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> consumes the
respiratory organs. This is a famous drawing by René Laennec, you know of
the Paris School of Medicine, who was a tuberculosis authority, and he did this
drawing of the onset of the cavitation in the lungs. Let&#39;s look at a picture
of it. </p>
<p>This is the process
of necrosis at work in the tissues, and the end result would be the destruction
of the lungs, which would look more or less like that. So, this was an
enormously painful, horrible and unpleasant disease. And I want to argue that
there are two great eras in the modern history of tuberculosis in which the
disease was conceived or thought of quite differently, and without much
relationship to the reality of the quality of the symptoms. The two periods
are divided by the watershed of the germ theory of disease, established by
Robert Koch from about 1882, and slowly then accepted thereafter by the medical
profession, and educated society as a whole; not instantly, but in the decades
that follow. </p>
<p>I&#39;d like to call the
first era the era of consumption, or perhaps the romantic era of tuberculosis.
Let&#39;s define it from the end of the eighteenth century to the middle, to about
the time of Robert Koch&#39;s discovery. It was jolted first by, in the 1860s and
&#39;70s, by the work of Jean-Antoine Villemin, in France, who first convincingly
proposed the idea that TB was contagious. And then the romantic era clearly
came to an end with the work of Robert Koch, when society accepts this new
interpretation, and the word consumption begins to fade from popular usage.
Thomas Mann&#39;s great book, <i>The Magic Mountain</i>, is perhaps the last great
artistic expression of the consumptive era and its susceptibilities.</p>
<p>Now, what was the
idea behind the romantic or consumptive theory? Its most authoritative
formulation was by the great authority of the Paris School of Medicine, René Laennec, whose
drawing you just saw; the man who invented the stethoscope and spent his life
listening to the lungs of tuberculosis patients. Laennec talked about what he
called the essentialist theory. Ironically, given the opposition of the Paris
School to Galen and humoralist teachings, we could see essentialism as actually
a form of humoralism revived, a kind of anti-contagionism in classic dress.
Now, note the irony. Your friend Ackerknecht--that is, the historian of medicine--observed
dryly, &quot;After all, things have to be explained somehow.&quot; </p>
<p>Well, TB was
explained primarily by internal causes, due to the inherited essence of the
patients; his or her constitution, or in Laennec&#39;s jargon, the patient&#39;s
diathesis, which caused him or her to be susceptible to the immediate factors
that triggered the actual illness. So, your diathesis was an inborn, inherited
defect. Precipiting or immediate causes supervened, and these were thought to
be some irregularity in the patient&#39;s life. Very important in the literature
were alcoholism and sexual excess. Laennec postulated that two sorts of issues
were important to him. One were what he called <i>les passions tristes</i>:
melancholy, sorrow, despair, and again sexual excess. The loss of bodily
fluids was thought to weaken the body and lead to illness. But both were
almost an aspect of an individual&#39;s fate, his or her nature. </p>
<p>So, consumption,
unlike the other great epidemic killer of the nineteenth century--that is,
cholera--was not thought to be contagious but hereditary, and therefore its
victims weren&#39;t feared or thought to be dangerous. And tuberculosis was a slow
killer, not a cause of sudden death. And its symptoms, by the canons of the
day, were deemed to be respectable, and not thought to be disgusting or a
source of unbearable torment. And death was private; unlike cholera, not a
public spectacle. Furthermore, tuberculosis wasn&#39;t so frightening because it
was also an endemic disease and was ever-present in society. So, the effects
on society were not at all like those of Asiatic cholera. </p>
<p>We mustn&#39;t think of
diseases as interchangeable causes of death that have the same effects on the
societies they afflict. Tuberculosis didn&#39;t lead to terror, hysteria,
xenophobia, revolt, and in its first phase it didn&#39;t lead to stigmatization,
but its opposite. Patients with tuberculosis were thought to be glamorous,
sexy, and chic. They were blameless, as it was their hereditary that was
responsible. And there weren&#39;t outbursts of religiosity. There was a
recognition that, in fact, large numbers of the social elite fell victim to the
disease. There was no poisoning frenzy. This disease was too slow, too
unrelated to digestion, too associated with the powerful, as well as the poor,
and it was true that doctors and officials paid their tribute to the disease.
But it did have major social effects, and let&#39;s think about what some of them
were. A first was the widespread experience of patients. This is the career
of invalidism. </p>
<p>Tuberculosis, after
diagnosis, became a lifetime&#39;s career. The rest of one&#39;s life, after receiving
diagnosis, was unknown and unpredictable. And this would affect every possible
decision: career choices; whether to marry and have a family, whether to place
one&#39;s normal responsibilities on hold and to devote life to seeking to recover
health. And, so, the sufferers tended to undertake a new and all-consuming
occupation, restoring health and learning to accept what would probably be an
early death. Let&#39;s think, for example, of Anton Chekhov, who&#39;s the man in the
left, pictured here with Leo Tolstoy.</p>
<p>Now, Chekhov, who
lived from 1860 to 1904, was a sufferer from consumption. He was forced to
abandon his own career, and his actress wife in Moscow, in the attempt to
restore his shattered health. To do so, he went to the mild climate of the
Crimea. His plays were all written in the period of his illness, and all
subtly have invalidism as a hidden but unmentioned theme. The protagonists in
Chekhov&#39;s plays, not by chance, seem oddly unable to act. They seem to be
waiting and waiting for events beyond their control to unfold. The middle
classes tended to go off to what was called &quot;taking the cure&quot;; that
is, they traveled--in Europe, they would go to a climate that was thought to be
favorable; spas and health resorts in southern Europe, on the French Riviera,
or in Italy. Those were favorite destinations. And the list of distinguished
travelers is lengthy. Keats and Shelley went to Rome. Tobias Smollett went to
Nice. The Brownings went to Florence. Chopin went to Majorca. Paul Ehrlich
went to Egypt. </p>
<p>But this was also
true in our own country. In the United States, people took sea journeys to
recover their health, or they traveled to the west and the southwest. And here
the famous frontier thesis in American history has yet another meaning. Health
seekers formed a substantial current--that is, of a movement west--and turned
into a large-scale movement, with the availability of the railroad from the
1870s. Colorado Springs and Pasadena are examples of communities that were
founded by, and for, tuberculosis sufferers. Also popular were other
destinations; Florida and the Caribbean. And the cure became a kind of
industry. It was stimulated by a flood of medical books; by rumor and
anecdote; by brochures prepared by interested parties, such as the railroad
companies. </p>
<p>There were other
exotic but more affordable ways of seeking the cure. One was altitude therapy,
in which you&#39;d go up high in a hot-air balloon. More commonly, people moved
outdoors simply where they lived. In New York City, at the turn of the
century, the buildings were dotted with people who&#39;d moved to live in tents on
the roofs and porches of apartment buildings, or in their backyards, if they
had them. Let me remind you of Professor Irving Fisher, of Yale University,
who in 1907 promoted health by inventing a tent that he claimed was perfectly
ventilated for those who took to the out of doors life, and he wanted his tent
to make outdoor living affordable for the poor. He himself was a consumptive,
but he regained his health after living out of doors, and he aimed to make the
cure universally available. </p>
<p>If you read the <i>New
York Times</i>, you would see there were people who moved not only to tents,
but also to tree houses that they constructed in their yards; an example being
Charles Battersby of Wrentham, Massachusetts, a consumptive who constructed a
house between two adjoining pine trees and moved into it fulltime in the winter
of 1906. Who knows to what extent the travels of people were also a means to
escape the regimens that if they stayed at home, their physicians would have
subjected them to at home? The treatments weren&#39;t especially enjoyable. There
was bleeding and cupping, to release the noxious agents. There were direct
applications to the lesions; poultices, ointments, infusions. There was also
the spray therapy; that is, inhalations in which the doctors were attempting to
attack the disease at its seat, as you inhaled gas mixtures; creosote and
carbolic acid, had a large vogue in these centuries. </p>
<p>Well, what about the
effectiveness of the travels? In some cases, it&#39;s probably safe to say that
the travels were beneficial. For pulmonary tuberculosis, it probably did help
to escape the urban smog of a place like London. For <i>Lupus vulgaris</i>,
the disease of the skin, sunlight is known to be beneficial. And it was
probably beneficial just to have hope, and to have the belief that you could do
something to help yourself; that probably did more good than harm. </p>
<p>Tuberculosis also
clearly had economic and demographic effects. Tuberculosis was the greatest
killer of the young, at the time, and it inevitably limited the growth of population.
It limited the expansion of the economy and caused widespread poverty. There
was a new awareness and sensitivity to this death, with romanticism.
Tuberculosis, I want to say, was not the cause of romanticism, but it is true
that romantic literature, and the arts, did fit some qualities about
tuberculosis. That is, romanticism stressed the transience of youth, early
death, melancholy, life as ephemeral, the importance of autumn as a symbol; no
longer now a symbol of the harvest, but as a time of falling leaves and dying
flowers, as death sets in. Genius was part of it. The redemptive and
ennobling idea of suffering, that releases the life of the soul, as the gross
material body wastes away. </p>
<p>And there was a
poetic quality that was attributed to tuberculosis. It was said to release
genius and creativity. One sees this portrayed in romantic works in the
century. Emily Brontë, <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>; Victor Hugo, <i>Les Mis</i><i>é</i><i>rables</i>; Alexandre Dumas, Henri Murger. Or romantic
opera: Verdi&#39;s <i>La Traviata</i>, or Puccini&#39;s <i>La Boh</i><i>è</i><i>me</i>. Then I would argue
that tuberculosis also--so, it had an effect, and the effect, the causal chain
worked in both ways; an effect in promoting romanticism, and romanticism in
turn promoted a certain understanding or social construction of the disease
itself--had a major impact then on literature, and was portrayed often in
literature, and indeed in the opera. </p>
<p>Tuberculosis also had
an effect on gender issues. I would argue that it helped to promote a new idea
of feminine beauty: thin, elongated; tubercular, in short. Pallor. At the
time, white powders--not suntan oil, as today--were the fashion. Let me show
you an example. This is a famous painting of a woman at the table, by Toulouse
Lautrec. And you&#39;ll note that she looks extremely pallid, and is quite thin.
But what I wanted to point out is what she has in front of her, which is a pot
of rice powder that she puts on her face to imitate the pallor of a
consumptive. One can see this also in the paintings of the pre-Raphaelites,
whose favorite models were often women with tuberculosis. Elizabeth Siddal,
for example, was a model for ten years, and then became the wife, of Dante
Rossetti, and became also a model for Millais. Jane Burden became the model,
and also the wife, of William Morris. And one can see some of the--you can see
the elongated--this is Mariana; this is the Beata Beatrix. </p>
<p>In any case then,
consumption was a fatal, debilitating and excruciatingly painful disease. But
paradoxically then it was given positive associations in the way it was
described at the time. Tuberculosis was said to make the body beautiful, to
make a person spiritual by wasting away the gross flesh, and it was said to
enhance creativity and genius. How can this be explained? Well, in the United
States, tuberculosis was also thought to be the white plague, partly because it
was popularly regarded as a disease that affected the white race and not
African-Americans, who were thought to have a different affliction in the
middle of the nineteenth century. Tellingly, it was called &quot;the white man&#39;s
plague&quot; and &quot;the white man&#39;s scourge,&quot; in this country. And in Europe, it
wasn&#39;t associated in the popular mind with the working classes, and people
remembered that aristocrats and artistic celebrities often contracted it. </p>
<p>You can see the power
of what we might call advertising, the endless stream of novels, poems, operas,
that extolled the beauty and sensitivity of those afflicted. In addition,
recalling what we said about bubonic plague, tuberculosis did not evoke the
fear of <i>mors repentina</i>: sudden death, so dreaded with bubonic plague or
Asiatic cholera. With consumption, there was no danger that a person would be
caught unaware and not even have time to write his or her will. The disease
was spiritual, in part, because it warned the sufferer of death in ample time
to work out one&#39;s relationship with God and with the community. </p>
<p>There was also a
simple matter of comparison. Consumption death, consumptive death, was perhaps
construed as beautiful because pulmonary disease didn&#39;t disfigure in the manner
of smallpox. Its symptoms weren&#39;t degrading, in the manner of Asiatic
cholera. Well so to make the point, let&#39;s turn to a work that probably all of
you know, the most influential, best-selling novel of the nineteenth century,
which was Harriet Beecher Stowe, <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i>. You probably know
very well that it was a religious novel, about social justice and God&#39;s way
with man, that it was about Simon Legree and the horrors of slavery, and called
for abolition. But you&#39;ve probably forgotten that it was also a major
tuberculosis novel, and that the heroine, the child Little Eva, dies of
consumption. </p>
<p>Let me remind you of
how Harriet Beecher Stowe described approaching death. And she wrote: &quot;For
so bright and placid was the farewell voyage of the little spirit--by such
sweet and fragrant breezes was the small bark borne towards the heavenly
shores---that it was impossible to realize that death was approaching. The
child felt no pain, only a tranquil soft weakness, daily and almost insensibly
increasing. And she was so beautiful, so loving, so trustful, so happy, that
one could not resist the soothing influence of that air of innocence and peace
that seemed to breathe all around her. Her father found a strange calm coming
over him. It wasn&#39;t hope--that was impossible; it was not resignation; it was
only a calm resting in the present that seemed so beautiful that he wished to
think of no future. It was like that hush of spirit that we feel amid the
bright, mild woods of autumn, when the bright hectic flush is on the trees, and
the last lingering flowers by the brook; and we joy in it all the more, because
we know that it will soon pass away.&quot; </p>
<p>Now, I would argue
that this bears little relationship to the actual extraordinary suffering of
tuberculosis at the very end, and I think it makes a good way to have a
transition from the consumptive era to what I would call the era of
tuberculosis, when the way that disease, this disease, was constructed and
understood changes radically. And this comes about after the germ theory of
disease and the work of Robert Koch, when the disease was found not to be
hereditary and due to one&#39;s diathesis, but to be a nasty, contagious disease,
when sufferers became objects of fear, and stigma attached to them; when the
glamour of consumption was stripped away, as was its association with feminine
beauty, and male genius and poetry, and its appeal as a period of spirituality
and sexuality disappeared. So, that&#39;s what I want to talk about next time,
which is the movement from the era of consumption to the era of tuberculosis. </p>
