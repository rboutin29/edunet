<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
Our subject this morning, and next time, is the AIDS pandemic, and I&#39;ll start
this morning dealing--in a sense by popular demand, because I know from visiting
sections that people were particularly concerned with bringing this study up to
date and talking about where we are at the moment. So, I&#39;ll be concentrating
largely on the global pandemic and where we are today. Then next time we&#39;ll
look more conventionally at the history of the AIDS epidemic, focusing on this
country and the experience of the United States--is how I&#39;m proposing to do
it. </p>
<p>We&#39;ll start with the
sort of run through of things that you probably know very well, but that we
really ought to discuss a bit as background--the nature of the disease, its
course in the body and its symptoms--and then we&#39;ll move on to the epidemiology
of where the pandemic is today, and some of both the worrying aspects about
this pandemic, and also a couple of the rays of hope, that of progress that has
been made, especially in the last couple of years. So, that&#39;s where we&#39;re
headed this morning. First of all, in terms of the disease--you know already,
because we&#39;ve talked about viruses--in this case a retrovirus.</p>
<p>Here we have a
slide, a schematic picture of the HIV virus. You know about it; that it&#39;s a
core containing two strands of genetic material, RNA, encased in a membrane,
with two glycoproteins on the surface. The glycoproteins, particularly this
one, 120, is crucial for allowing the virus to target certain cells. In the
case of this virus, it targets the T4 cells in the body, which are the ones
that regulate antibodies and are the regulators of the body&#39;s immune system.
Well, once attached to the T4 cell, the RNA penetrates the host cell, and for a
time it&#39;s inactive, even for years. There then occurs a trigger, or detonator,
which may be--this is a little speculative--an infection that activates the T4
cells, and then the RNA is converted into DNA that penetrates the chromosomes
of the host cell and turns it into a factory for the reproduction of the virus
and the killing of the cell. </p>
<p>So, the retrovirus is
an absolute parasite. It takes over the controls of living T cells and turns
them into factories to reproduce virus. Now, this we can see also in a
picture. This is a slide of an infected T cell, and this is an image of a cell
reproducing HIV. And finally let me show you, this is a picture of an HIV
particle budding from an infected T cell. This is how the--part of the
mechanism of the disease. And let&#39;s talk about what happens to the body in
terms of symptoms. </p>
<p>First there&#39;s an
incubation period of some six to eight weeks, after which there occurs the
primary infection. Symptoms at that stage, in the majority of cases, are
flu-like; that is to say fever, night sweats, muscular aches and pains,
fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, headache, sore throat, sometimes diarrhea,
sometimes a rash. Then the symptoms disappear after a few weeks, and in many
cases there&#39;s a prolonged period that&#39;s entirely asymptomatic. This is a
period of latency, which can last months, and has been known to last even as
long as ten years or more, the time being entirely unpredictable. But during
this period, the virus continues to multiply and destroy the cells of the
immune system.</p>
<p>Then there comes the
period of active AIDS, where there are direct lesions caused by the retrovirus,
carried in some cases to the brain. Sometimes there&#39;s neurological damage,
known as AIDS dementia, or loss of motor control, memory, sometimes reasoning
power. But the characteristic, as you know, of AIDS, different from most
infections, is that it&#39;s not the symptoms that it causes itself, but rather its
ability to give rise to opportunistic infections by switching off the body&#39;s
immune system, making it vulnerable to an exotic variety of infections that the
body is unable to fight. This is immunosuppression. </p>
<p>Later in the disease,
the victim experiences weight loss, lethargy, recurrent yeast infections,
rashes or sores, fevers and night sweats. Active AIDS develops when a patient
has fewer, with HIV, than 200 T cells per micro liter of blood. The normal
count is 800 to 1200. From this point, the average untreated--and I stress
untreated--AIDS patient has about two or three years to live. Sometimes other
symptoms develop: difficulty swallowing, loss of memory, cough, shortness of
breath, sometimes seizure, nausea or impaired vision. But death is usually
caused by a whole array of opportunistic infections, with names familiar to
you, like candidiasis, <i>pneumocystis carinii</i> pneumonia, Kaposi&#39;s sarcoma,
cytomegalovirus, cryptococcal meningitis; but above all tuberculosis, which is
the most important of the opportunistic infections of AIDS, and globally, at
least, the most common immediate cause of death. </p>
<p>Note this
characteristic of AIDS. Its course is not just the direct result of the virus
itself on the body, but those pathologies which are substratum are combined
with those of a series of other diseases superimposed on the AIDS virus,
because of the progressive destruction of the immune system. And note how well
adapted the virus is to its ecological niche in the human population. It&#39;s a
lethal disease, but one that avoids killing its host too quickly. A major
evolutionary advantage begins with a lengthy asymptomatic latent period, as
HIV, when it&#39;s contagious, but the infective patient almost certainly doesn&#39;t
know that he or she harbors the virus in his or her body. And then full-blown
AIDS can last for long years, while again the patient remains infective. </p>
<p>Well, what about
transmission? Transmission can occur in a variety of ways. As you know, it&#39;s
transmitted sexually. Everyone knows that. We need to remember there was a
myth about AIDS, in the outset in this country in the &#39;80s, that it was a gay
plague, that it spread homosexually. And you all know about the Moral Majority
and Reverend Jerry Falwell, who welcomed AIDS as God&#39;s sword to destroy
homosexuality. </p>
<p>Apart from blasphemy,
and the arrogance of a claim to know God&#39;s will, what&#39;s most striking about
Falwell&#39;s comment is his complete ignorance of the facts of epidemiology. The
virus is present in bodily fluids: blood, semen, vaginal secretions, breast
milk. So, one means is certainly sexual intercourse; especially intercourse
involving an infected partner where there are lesions that allow the virus to
penetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream. Hence sex, heterosexual or
homosexual, where there&#39;s a pre-existing venereal infection such as herpes, is
particularly dangerous, or sex that causes abrasions, such as anal
intercourse. </p>
<p>The risk factor is
not homosexuality but promiscuity, by which I would define as sex outside the
context of a loving relationship, whether heterosexual or homosexual. In
Africa today, it has been established epidemiologically that multiple partner
sex behaviors account for two-thirds of all new infections. But AIDS can be
transmitted in other ways, despite what Jerry Falwell said. It can be transmitted
through the blood by shared needles and syringes, for example, needles that
haven&#39;t been sterilized but are shared. One thinks of injecting drug users.
One can think also of patients in resource poor health systems, in which
needles are scarce and not routinely sterilized. One can think also of unsafe
blood supplies; blood that isn&#39;t screened, and is supplied to people by people
who are remunerated, thereby making every transfusion a risk for HIV
transmission, for patients who have surgery, or for hemophiliacs. </p>
<p>Another factor, of
course, is the sex industry, where the disease spreads rampantly among sex
workers and their clients. And then there&#39;s vertical transmission, a real
shock to Jerry Falwell. The disease can be transmitted transplacentally from
mother to fetus, or from mother to infant via breast milk. This is one of the
drivers of the present day pandemic. In 2008, the latest statistics, children
constituted just under twenty percent of all new infections, and nearly the
same percentage of AIDS-related mortality. Well what about the epidemiology of
this pandemic? We&#39;re now a quarter of a century into the global AIDS
epidemic. And I would argue that AIDS is a good example of one of the themes
with which we began our course: whether epidemic diseases are part of the big
picture of history. </p>
<p>I would argue that
you wouldn&#39;t be able, in the future, to write the history of the late-twentieth
and twenty-first centuries without devoting an ample space to the AIDS pandemic
and its consequences. From the standpoint of the industrial world--Western
Europe, North America--some people have a comforting illusion that the
emergency has been controlled; for a couple of reasons. One is the fact that
the number of cases in the developed world has leveled off; except that in the
last few years there have been some troubling signs, including right here in
the United States. And secondly, there&#39;s been the development of expensive
drug cocktails that have reduced mortality significantly, with many patients
experiencing the disease as a chronic illness. But we need to be very careful
about complacency. </p>
<p>There are only seven
countries in the world that have more cases of HIV infection than the United
States. In 2006, there were 1.2 million people living with HIV in the United
States, and the number is not declining at all. Furthermore, we need to
remember that living with HIV as a chronic disease is itself enormously
problematic. It means an expensive and complicated regimen of pills, and the
medication itself is toxic and has unpleasant side-effects. The evidence seems
to suggest too that patients with HIV-AIDS, under treatment, experience
nevertheless a significantly higher incidence of other diseases, and that they
die at a significantly lower age. And then very disturbingly, since 2004
there&#39;s been a real spike in HIV infections among men who have sex with men.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, worldwide
the pandemic continues. In the words of the UNAIDS Report for 2008, it was
continuing at a staggering level. At the end of 2007, the World Health
Organization reported globally that 33 million people were affected by
HIV/AIDS; that there were 4.5 million new infections during that year, and
during that dreadful year nearly 3 million AIDS deaths. That&#39;s something like
8,200 people a day. 2006 also witnessed 4.3 million new infections. In 2007
and &#39;08, the number of deaths decreased, and that was partly due to the
increased access to therapy, antiretroviral therapy, that lowered mortality. </p>
<p>In 2010, for the
first time, UNAIDS suggested some reasons for optimism, but optimism of a
strictly limited kind. Not that progress was being made to controlling and
decreasing the epidemic, but that it seemed to have leveled off. That was one
of the hopeful stories of the UN Report of this year. It remains true though
that most people in resource-poor countries who need retroviral therapy still
don&#39;t receive it. But let&#39;s look at some of the graphs. </p>
<p>This was HIV at the
end of 2005, and it shows the total of 40.3 million people with HIV/AIDS, and
below that it shows the numbers of newly infected people and the number of AIDS
deaths for 2005. And this gives you some idea of the dramatic inequality of
the burden of HIV/AIDS, that it&#39;s enormously a burden in Sub-Saharan Africa,
which has more than half of the total number of AIDS people in the world. Or
let&#39;s look at this picture, which just gives a clear indication of where the
epicenter of the AIDS is, which is in Southern Africa; countries such as
Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Angola,
Mozambique. There the WHO reported in 2006, and again in 2008, that the
epidemic was still rampant, that the trend still offers no comfort. And in the
sub-region as a whole, life expectancy has actually declined, because of AIDS,
to below fifty; plunging to levels not seen indeed since the 1950s. </p>
<p>Swaziland and
Botswana have the unhappy distinction of having the world&#39;s highest prevalence
of HIV/AIDS. And here you see the worst-case scenario. Twenty-six percent of
people are infected with HIV, the highest levels ever recorded, as are twenty
percent of pregnant women. Those are rates of prevalence that the Center for
Disease Control once thought to be impossible, and life expectancy at birth
dropped below forty years in several countries in the region. With nearly 6
million people living with HIV, in 2008, South Africa has the sad record of
possessing the largest HIV epidemic in the world in absolute numbers, not
though per capita. </p>
<p>Now,
epidemiologically it now seems that there are two great divergent patterns in
this terrible epidemic. In the industrial world, it&#39;s primarily an affliction
of high-risk groups. We&#39;ll talk about them in a moment: men who have sex with
men; sex workers; injecting drug users. This is what the World Health
Organization calls &quot;concentrated epidemics,&quot; in which the pandemic is confined,
above overwhelmingly, to certain high-risk groups. But there&#39;s a second and
more devastating pattern, clearly evident in southern Africa, where HIV/AIDS is
a leading cause of death, and where transmission among high-risk groups
certainly occurs, but it&#39;s overwhelmed by transmission in the general
population. There transmission is primarily through heterosexual sex, and
significantly more women are infected than men. And it&#39;s also true, as I&#39;ve
said, that transmission occurs on a large scale, vertically from mother to
unborn child, so that significant numbers of children are born with congenital
AIDS. </p>
<p>Why women? And this
is again one of the themes of our course, and I&#39;ll be dealing in part here with
poverty, and not just poverty but inequality. Women, in part, because of
biology. The disease is more easily transmitted from men to women than
vice-versa. It&#39;s also true, clearly true in Sub-Saharan Africa, that sexual
activity tends to start earlier for women. Young women in many parts of
Sub-Saharan Africa also frequently have sex with much older partners. Sexual
inequality also fuels the sex industry, as does--the epidemic is primed also by
violence against women, and often the inability of women in many situations to
negotiate safe sex practices. In many parts of the world girls are simply
severely discriminated against in terms of education, and therefore do not
acquire sex education and knowledge necessary to take effective measures to
protect themselves and control their reproduction. </p>
<p>Girls who have not
received primary school education are twice as likely to be infected with HIV
as those with higher educational attainments. And as I said, violence against
women is a major factor in the epidemic. It&#39;s also true that we need to
mention cultural norms in these areas where notions of masculinity are
important determinants of male behavior patterns that increase the risk of
AIDS; the idea that it&#39;s meritorious to have multiple partners, and unmanly to
use condoms. </p>
<p>Well, this is an
epidemic that can serve also as a review for some of the themes of our course.
We see this epidemic being primed by a number of factors that by now are
familiar to you, in comparative discourse. There&#39;s a clear link with poverty.
The countries with uncontrolled epidemics are among the poorest nations in the
world, and poverty is directly linked with the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS.
Poverty prevents national governments from building effective public health
structures, or educational infrastructures. And studies of sectors most at
risk from the epidemic in southern Africa--that is, sexually active young
people in the fifteen to twenty-five age group--those studies reveal that large
numbers of people of that age group still do not have an accurate understanding
of the mechanisms of AIDS transmission. </p>
<p>Local studies also
show in some places the disturbingly large numbers of sexually active young
people--twenty-five percent have been discovered in places--still have no idea
of what a condom is. Poverty prevents people from having access to means to
defend themselves: education, medical care and treatment for those already
infected. It drives recruitment into the sex industry, another major driver of
the pandemic. It leads to unemployment, demoralization and alienation; all of
which fuel high-risk behavior, including intravenous drug use, and that in turn
leads to further unsafe sex practices. Then there&#39;s the social and economic
impact, which is maximized by the age profile of the victims themselves; that
is, young men and women in the prime of life, who should be the mainstays of
families and their economies. </p>
<p>In some places
poverty even destroys the effects of sex education itself. In Uganda, for
example, the newspaper the <i>Uganda Monitor</i>, reported two years ago that
condoms remained so far beyond the means of many people that a widespread
practice was to boil them after use and reuse them. Then another theme in our
course. We&#39;ve talked about urbanization and its role with certain diseases;
not all, malaria was clearly very different. But it&#39;s no coincidence that southern
Africa, where the pandemic is rampant, is also rapidly, rapidly urbanizing, and
that indeed twenty percent of the global burden of HIV/AIDS falls on fifteen
cities in southern Africa. </p>
<p>Another theme of our
course is represented by AIDS, and that&#39;s the impact of conflict and war. The
movement of troops once again has proved to be ideal for sexually transmitted
diseases, and for prostitution. And the spread of other STDs--syphilis,
gonorrhea and herpes--actually furthers the spread of AIDS. The lesions that
they cause, like genital ulcers, provide ideal portals for entry of HIV into
the body. </p>
<p>Trade and modern
means of transport have been important. One can&#39;t understand the AIDS epidemic
without roads, railroads, the airplane. Societal neglect is a theme we&#39;ve
talked about, and national governments, in some cases nations that are poor and
under-developed and have virtual status as almost failed states, have been
incapable of taking major initiatives on their own, in terms of improving the
health of their populations. But in some cases they also have other
priorities. </p>
<p>There&#39;s the siren
song of military spending. There&#39;s corruption. Or let&#39;s take the case of the
former president of South Africa, Mbeki, who refused to take science seriously,
and rejected the idea that the HIV virus causes AIDS. He called on people not
to use condoms, but simply to drink a mixture of olive oil and garlic as a
prophylactic of choice. So, there&#39;s been a current of AIDS dissidents who
reject the link between the virus and the disease. Fortunately, that situation
has changed. </p>
<p>Then there&#39;s
stigmatization, which is a cause of the spread of the epidemic. It causes
people at risk not to seek medical attention, and that in turn undermines
surveillance and active understanding of the epidemiology of the disease. And
the inequality of women who are stigmatized has a number of structural
consequences: that is, in terms of inheritance laws that disenfranchise them;
unequal jobs in the economy; violence; early sexual debut; and large-spread
practices of what UNAIDS calls &quot;transactional sex.&quot; In Kenya, for example,
teenage girls are three times more likely to be infected with HIV than boys of
the same age, and the differential, instead of decreasing, increases with age.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also the
displacement of people, and HIV/AIDS thrives on migrant labor, on disrupted
families, on refugee status. And in industries where migrants live, for
example, among miners, in compounds at vast distances from their homes and
families, a situation that leads to the thriving of commercial sex. Mobile
populations are at high risk of infection. And then one of the vicious factors
of HIV/AIDS is the burden of the disease itself, which causes the burden of
poverty to increase, and poverty furthers the epidemic. AIDS then leads to a
vicious downward spiral in which poverty creates favorable conditions for AIDS.
AIDS breeds poverty, and so on. </p>
<p>In the words of the
UNAIDS Report for 2008: &quot;HIV causes a greater loss of productivity than
any other disease, and is likely to push an additional 6 million households
into poverty by 2015. HIV has inflicted the single greatest reversal in human
development in modern history.&quot; That was the UN Report. And then there
is super-infection; that is, multiple infections with different strains of
AIDS. And one of the most tragic factors of all is the phenomenon of AIDS
orphans. The WHO reports staggering numbers of them. It terms it &quot;a
crisis of gargantuan proportions.&quot; Already in Sub-Saharan Africa, 11
million children under fifteen are orphans; a number that&#39;s expected, given
current and projected prevalence of HIV infection, to reach the staggering
figure of 25 million in a few years. In the worst infected cases, it could be,
if this actually materializes, that one child in five could be an AIDS orphan.
</p>
<p>What are the effects
of this dreadful pandemic on societies? Again we see that this functions
almost as a review of themes of our course. Clearly no one would be able to
write the history of the present moment in southern Africa without giving a
central place to HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS prevents education and literacy. At the
heart of the epidemic in Botswana is the fact that the disease kills teachers
more rapidly than they can be replaced; that poor families, with a member ill
from AIDS, can&#39;t afford to send children to school. The fact that it destroys
healthcare systems. In many countries in southern Africa fifty percent of all
hospitalizations are due to HIV/AIDS, and nearly all other healthcare
interventions and programs have therefore been erased or radically downscaled.
</p>
<p>It destroys
productivity and creates a crippling burden of disease, destroys families and
communities, thereby trapping whole countries in underdevelopment and
international dependency. It destroys civil society and undermines democracy.
It&#39;s the substratum for a lethal epidemic that follows in its wake, the
reemergence of tuberculosis, the classic opportunistic infection complicating
HIV/AIDS. And TB is rising at a rate of six percent per annum in southern
Africa, where 2 million cases of TB are diagnosed a year. Businesses find that
they&#39;re crippled. There are high rates of absenteeism. There&#39;s a real
shortage of skilled workers available. There are high rates of turnover, and
it&#39;s extremely expensive to train new workers. And, of course, the rocketing
healthcare expenses that they face. </p>
<p>There&#39;s a major
cultural impact on societies. Clearly this undermines any confident sense that
a society is protecting one. There&#39;s a demographic impact. We&#39;ve already seen
the way in which HIV/AIDS is altering the age structure of whole populations
and transforming life expectancy. And there&#39;s even the possibility of failed
states as a direct result of disease, with enormous implications for security,
political stability and democracy. But this last fact paradoxically has also
opened a ray of hope. The realization that I last mentioned affected the
national security estimate of our own government, which reckoned that in fact
HIV/AIDS was a major threat to the security of the United States; the first
time that disease was recognized by the CIA and the security community as a
threat to our country. And this was reinforced by studies by, for example, the
RAND Corporation. </p>
<p>The result of this
realization, that we are indeed a global community, and that what&#39;s happening
in Southern Africa and other places is of enormous impact throughout the world,
led to a massive investment of funds. And I&#39;d most like to mention PEPFAR, the
President&#39;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, that was established by President
Bush in 2004. It now targets fifteen countries, has been extended under
President Obama, and those countries are primarily, though not exclusively, in southern
Africa. Initially it was fifteen billion dollars over several years, and has
been renewed since, and it became the largest commitment of funding to an
international health effort ever recorded. </p>
<p>This has led with
the--there&#39;s also funds through the Gates Foundation particularly directed at
research, and through the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis.
One of the conclusions is that there&#39;s been--that we could reach--is that in
the last years, under this massive new investment of effort and funding, that
the world health community is developing much more sophisticated strategies for
dealing with this epidemic, that it has much more data and information, and
that it&#39;s learned a number of important, indeed vital, lessons. </p>
<p>What are some of the
conclusions that provide us with at least a measure of hope? One of them is
that in campaigns against this disease, one size definitely does not fit all.
And here we see another theme of our course, that information, hard data, is
absolutely crucial to any effective public health strategy. Public health
needs to be based on a solid basis of information, and in this case we see a
rapid up-scaling of testing and surveillance as one of the key components of
the global effort to combat the disease. That&#39;s necessary because it
establishes the clear idea that the epidemiology of this disease in each
society is distinctive, and that in turn enables the campaign to concentrate
resources, to change tactics, depending on the actual results of the
interventions so far. </p>
<p>So, you need to be
able to, in order to have sound public health, scientifically to assess what
you&#39;ve done to date, and to change course if it&#39;s not working properly. One of
the hopeful signs in the AIDS pandemic is that the campaign has become more
sophisticated and focused. It has been realized that strategies that fit one
phase in the history of the epidemic may not be effective at another stage.
And, so, the response has continually to be updated and adapted. </p>
<p>The priority now is
to clearly identify high burden areas as a priority, and to saturate them with
prevention efforts. The slogan of PEPFAR, for this reason, is &quot;Know Your
Epidemic.&quot; In the past, for example, anti-AIDS programs failed to target
married couples, and people in long-term relationships, couples in which one
partner in particular is HIV-positive while the other is not; in the jargon of
the World Health Organization, &quot;discordant couples.&quot; Another lesson, that the
commitment cannot be short-term; that it must be sustained. That short-term
interventions that are then scaled back can be useless and counter-productive.
</p>
<p>A good illustration
is Uganda, which a few years ago was one of the bright spots in Africa. When
the government invested heavily in sex education, in the provision of condoms,
and the fostering of new and healthy sexual behaviors, the results were highly
successful, until funding was scaled back in favor of other priorities. And
since then, the epidemic in Uganda has resurged with a vengeance. And one
could say something similar about Thailand. There are also new strategies. </p>
<p>Let me give you a
couple of examples. One is the need to abolish the distinction, in this
pandemic, between prevention and treatment as a false dichotomy. Because
treatment with antiretroviral therapy is in fact a valid and essential
preventive strategy. In particular, antiretroviral therapy radically lowers
the incidence of vertical transmission from mother to child. It&#39;s also true
that antiretroviral treatment lowers the viral load, and therefore reduces
transmission. Antiretroviral therapy is a prophylactic because it prolongs the
life of parents, thereby decreasing the number of orphans and vulnerable
children; the very people who fuel the sex industry and are most likely to
indulge in unsafe sex practices because they lack education, resources and
access to medical care. </p>
<p>PEPFAR has
concentrated recently on making generic antiretroviral therapies available in
focused countries, at an affordable price, and the FDA, in this country, has
established fast-track approval to allow antiretrovirals to be rapidly reviewed
and cleared. By the end of 2008, antiretroviral therapy had been extended to 10
million people with HIV/AIDS, and especially to pregnant women who are
HIV-positive. Another hopeful sign. At first, PEPFAR was ideologically
motivated, and stipulated that one-third of its funding had to go to abstinence-only
education. But this has been demonstrated by results to be counterproductive
and so has largely been dropped, and funding has been redirected toward other
aspects of the program. </p>
<p>Another stress has
been on gender inequality. And here I want to stress that it&#39;s not only
poverty but inequality that drives this epidemic forward. Let me give you the
example of Swaziland, which is at the epicenter of this pandemic. One third of
women in the eighteen-to-twenty-four age group were found to have experienced
sexual violence, as had one quarter of girls under fifteen. So, providing
education and re-education, stressing the dangers of power differentials in
intimate relationships, has been important in demonstrating the devastating
consequences of sexual entitlement, and also offering adolescent women
vocational training so that they would have the skills necessary in the
marketplace, and hence the economic independence that was a major determinant
of public health. </p>
<p>Until recent years,
HIV/AIDS programs avoided what might be called socioeconomic and cultural
determinants of the pandemic, concentrating on generic awareness, but not
confronting the specifics of local situations that fuel the epidemic. Let me
give you an example of targeting specific high-burden groups and areas. One of
them has been in recent years the targeting of intravenous drug users, and
removing ideological blinkers, and simply talking in terms of epidemiology and
hard science, leading to such innovations as needle exchange programs to make
blood safe, and indeed in a couple of countries to opioid substitution
treatments to remove, or at least to downscale, heroin addiction, thereby once
again lowering the rates of transmission. </p>
<p>Another major
intervention has been on establishing safe blood supplies, combating what we
might call the medical transmission of HIV/AIDS, through the establishment of
laboratories, when with them the screening of all blood and the recruitment of
donors from low-risk sectors of the population on a non-remunerated basis. Or
there&#39;s been the awareness of the utility of male circumcision as a
prophylactic measure in this pandemic. Let me then just contrast the situation
in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic is, in the population, the general
population, with a couple of other worrying places in the world--and I&#39;ll end
then on a slightly more somber note--some places that are currently sources of
concern, outside of Africa. </p>
<p>There&#39;s Eastern
Europe, and the former areas of the Soviet Union, where UNAIDS has talked about
an emerging epidemic, unlike that of Southern Africa. The epidemic has a
different profile. It&#39;s a concentrated epidemic, showing prevalence among
high-risk groups, like intravenous drug users. In Saint Petersburg, thirty
percent of intravenous drug users are under nineteen-years-of-age, and the
sharing of needles is the norm. And it&#39;s also driven by the sex industry, and
by the collapse of the healthcare system, and fueled also by some religious
attitudes which scorn sex education and the use of condoms, or devote resources
to a practice of abstinence education, which has demonstrably not worked. Or
there&#39;s East Asia and the Pacific; again, injecting drug use, sex industry, low
condom use and sexual tourism, all of these being risk factors that are
cumulative. </p>
<p>I&#39;ll conclude just
with a couple of worrying points about our own country. The outbreak began in
the &#39;80s, as far as we know, peaked around 1993, and then declined steeply
until approximately the year 2001, since which time there&#39;s been an upturn; and
a surprising degree of misinformation has abounded. New infections, we can
see, demonstrate that the epidemic has been transformed, and the epidemic in
the United States is totally unlike what&#39;s happening in Southern Africa. New
infections are overwhelmingly among men; 718,000 males affected and 160,000
women. And it tends to be among concentrated groups: men who have sex with
men; drug users; and ethnic minorities--African-Americans, who have half of the
new cases in the last few years, and Hispanics. </p>
<p>A transformation
occurred. AIDS in the 1980s was primarily a disease among the white
population. It has since declined among whites, and spread disturbingly among
minorities; African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians. So, at that point I&#39;ll
refer you to Wednesday, when we&#39;ll talk about the United States in greater
detail. And I&#39;ll just conclude, since I&#39;ve run out of time, by saying that the
pandemic at the moment is extremely active. The most hopeful thing I could say
to you is not that it&#39;s being controlled, but that it seems to be globally
stabilized; but there are a number of really worrying places in the world, and
some very worrying developments.</p>
