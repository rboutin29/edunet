<p><b>Professor Frank
Snowden:</b>
This morning we&#39;re going to do something a little bit different, which is I
thought that everyone was ready for a break. So, we&#39;re going to have a guest
lecturer this morning. I thought it was particularly important that at some
point we give you a perspective from the clinical point of view, and so I&#39;m
introducing to you Dr. Margaret Craven, and I&#39;ll just say a couple of things
about her. She&#39;s an OB/GYN, and so for about thirty years she was involved in
the trenches in the war against HIV/AIDS. And she&#39;s going to talk to us this
morning about HIV/AIDS in this country, as I said last time. And that&#39;s about
all I wanted to say; except one other detail, which is that she&#39;s also my wife.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Margaret Craven:</b> AIDS is
fundamentally different than any other emerging global pandemic preceding it,
because of the high velocity of its spread around the world, and of the race to
understand and control it. I have given you a handout, which is a copy of the
1981 MMWR, which stands for Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, of the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. The CDC was founded in 1946 to control
malaria, and is now part of the Department of Health and Human Services. The
MMWR is their fast-track method of publishing a medical article. This is
basically so that clinicians can be up to speed on things. </p>
<p>One report is from
Los Angeles about cases of pneumocystis pneumonias in gay men. In the same issue
there was also a report from New York City about a rare cancer called Kaposi&#39;s
sarcoma in gay men. Imagine that you&#39;re working in the field of public health
and are reading this. The front page describes five cases of men between the
ages of twenty-nine and thirty-six. All of them are gay and all have a rare
lung infection called pneumocystis pneumonia. The back page of the report has
an editorial note explaining what it is, as it is so rare that nobody would
ever have heard of it. The article was the starting gun for a sprint on the
part of the medical community. </p>
<p>Within three years of
this publication by the CDC, the human immunodeficiency virus was identified as
the cause of AIDS, the emerging epidemic of our times. It is even more
fragile, fastidious and miniscule than the bacteria that cause syphilis or
gonorrhea. But it is spread the same way, through the intimate exchange of
bodily fluids. How did HIV become such a powerful and widespread killer in
such a short time, causing the present worldwide pandemic of around 33 million
infected individuals? How has it left more than 25 million of us dead, and 14
million children orphaned? Why did it still infect about 2.7 million of us in
the year 2007, and kill 2 million people that year? </p>
<p>Certain historical
background conditions made this tragedy possible: globalization; invasive
medical technology, especially blood transfusions; and migration and
concentration of gay men. Globalization is a phenomenon that&#39;s been gathering
momentum ever since Christopher Columbus linked the two hemispheres. I think
you&#39;ve heard about the Columbian Exchange. Many thinkers have written about
it. I quote one of them: </p>
<p>&quot;The need of a
constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the
whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere,
establish connections everywhere. The bourgeoisie has, through its
exploitation of the world market, given a cosmopolitan character to production
and consumption in every country. To the great chagrin of reactionists, it has
drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood,
while old, established national industries have been destroyed, or are daily
being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction
becomes a life and death question for all civilized nations; by industries that
no longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the
remotest zones.&quot; </p>
<p>You may have recently
heard about the tanker on the Australian Reef that was going to China.
&quot;Industries whose products are consumed not only at home, but in every
quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants satisfied by the productions
of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products
of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion
and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal
interdependence of nations.&quot; </p>
<p>Who do you think
wrote this? Could it be Tom Friedman, who frequently contributes to the <i>New
York Times</i> and writes extensively on globalization? How about Adam Smith
or Karl Marx, both very famous political economists of earlier centuries? Or
is it Jos&eacute; Bov&eacute;, a French farmer who
organized a peaceful removal of McDonald&#39;s from his town in France? </p>
<p>I quote once more.
&quot;The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one-hundred years, has created
more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding
generations together: subjection of nature&#39;s forces to man and machinery;
application of chemistry to industry and agriculture; steam navigation;
railways; electric telegraphs; clearing of whole continents for cultivation;
canalization of rivers; whole populations conjured out of the ground. What
earlier century had even a presentment that such productive forces slumbered in
the lack of social labor? Modern bourgeois society, with its relations of
production, of exchange and of property; a society that has conjured up such
gigantic means of production and of exchange is like the sorcerer who is no
longer able to control the powers of the netherworld, whom he has called up by
his spells.&quot; </p>
<p>It sounds like this
prophet, Karl Marx, speaking from the mid-nineteenth century, would not have
been surprised to learn that an even faster mode of transportation, air travel,
has been invented. It now links all the continents of the globe, so that we
can wake up in Africa and go to bed in Canada. This enabled one good-looking
French Canadian, gay and very promiscuous airline steward, so-called Patient Zero,
to be instrumental in spreading the AIDS epidemic throughout North America.
These same forces also gave birth to a growing science and technology that
formed the underpinnings of modern biomedical research and Western medicine. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s reminisce about
the good-old days in the 1970s, pre-AIDS. I was an OB/GYN resident and
remember that the medical profession was full of optimism and hope. A
positive, rather complacent attitude was instilled in us medical students about
what hardworking, well-trained doctors would be able to accomplish. We would
be able to fix the body&#39;s mechanical defects with needles, tubes, surgeries and
blood products. Syphilis, TB, cholera and the other bacteria diseases would be
eliminated with antibiotics. Vaccinations could cure a long list of awful
diseases, like smallpox, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, and on and on.
Globalization of medicine in the World Health Organization would make
eradication of these diseases from the entire globe possible. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s the World
Health Organization&#39;s optimistic definition of health, back in those days.
Ambitious scientists and doctors were busy competing for grants, positions at
prestigious laboratories, and prizes like the Nobel Prize. The Surgeon General
of the United States announced rather arrogantly in 1976: &quot;We have turned
the page on infectious diseases.&quot; This smug medical attitude suddenly
disappeared in the 1980s, when our community was confronted with a totally new
and mysterious emerging pandemic. Where did it come from? How did it start? </p>
<p>I highly recommend to
you a book named <i>The River</i>, written by an Englishman, Edward Hooper, who
tries to answer these very questions. The author&#39;s avowed role model is Dr.
John Snow, the first modern epidemiologist. He wrote a book about tracking
down the source of cholera through the London water supply in 1849; you
probably covered that in the course. Like Snow, Hooper has done an exhaustive
investigation of every available source of knowledge relating to the emergence
of the AIDS epidemic. Instead of one city, however, he has had to trace the
epidemic to three continents. His story starts in the United States, with the
first reported cases from the CDC that you have there, and traces the chain of
infection backwards in time. </p>
<p>Hooper agrees with
Randy Shilts, who wrote the AIDS classic <i>And the Band Played On</i>. Both
think that the beginning of the epidemic here was probably July 4<sup>th</sup>,
1976. To celebrate the bicentennial of our nation, New York City hosted the
Tall Ships. Huge sailing ships came from all over the world, and there was a
lot of international partying going on in the Big Apple. Retrospectively,
studies revealed that the first American babies who were HIV-positive were born
in New York City a year later; 1977. </p>
<p>Hooper&#39;s story then
moves to Haiti. The refugees seeking asylum here seemed to have a horrifyingly
high incidence of HIV, and as a result many Americans went through a phase of
scapegoating Haitian refugees as the source of AIDS. &quot;Papa Doc&quot; had
a brutal regime that ruled Haiti from 1957 to 1971, by means of violent death
squads called the Tonton Macoutes. Therefore, when the Belgium Congo in Africa
became independent from Belgium in 1960, thousands of French-speaking
professionals escaped their oppressive government by taking jobs in the Congo.
In addition, to help solve his economic problems in Haiti, &quot;Papa Doc&quot;
promoted his capital as a tourist attraction for gay men from North America and
Germany. </p>
<p>Haiti was not the
only country linking the chain of infection back to the Belgium colonies in
Africa. The epicenter of the disease is found where Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and
Uganda come together by standard epidemiologic detective work. This is a
picture of a refugee camp that is right in that area where AIDS originated.
How it started is a much more controversial issue. Hooper finds extremely
compelling the hypothesis that an oral polio vaccine, tested in Africa in 1958,
in the very place that is now the epicenter of the disease, may have enabled
the simian immunosuppressive virus to cross species from chimps to humans.
This hypothesis is one among several about how the simian immune virus could
have mutated into a human disease. Of course, there&#39;s no ethical way of
proving any of them, so we will never actually know what happened. </p>
<p>Anyhow, back to what
we know for sure. Another background condition responsible for the rapid
spread of AIDS are the tools of modern western medicine: hypodermic needles,
blood banking and invasive surgical techniques. One of the first cases of
recognized AIDS occurred in a Danish surgeon named Grethe Rask, who had gone to
work in the Congo in 1964. She worked for three years in a rural hospital that
often had no surgical gloves, doing her surgery barehanded. She fell ill in
1976, eventually having to fly back to Denmark under emergency conditions, and
died there in 1977. As we saw from the CDC Report, the pneumocystis pneumonia
that she had was a rare opportunistic infection that only occurs in people with
severe compromise of their immune systems. According to close friends, she had
no other possible route of infection than performing surgery, because she was
celibate and basically spent her whole life working. </p>
<p>Hemophiliacs also
were one of the first groups noted to have this new disease, because they
needed to use pooled factor VIII to prevent bleeding. At that time, factor
VIII was used from concentrated pooled serum from many units of donated blood,
and by 1984 fifty percent of hemophiliacs were HIV-positive. And of course the
tools of medicine don&#39;t stay locked in offices and hospitals. Needles made
their way onto the street for shooting the heroin that globalized Mafia was
making available. IV drug use also preceded the arrival of HIV in New York at the
Fourth of July celebration in 1976. IVDUs--that stands for intravenous drug
users-- soon became one of the high-risk groups for AIDS, along with
hemophiliacs. Let&#39;s take off that ugly picture. </p>
<p>The fourth factor in
the rapid spread of the epidemic was the migration and concentration of gay men
in certain locations. How and why did this happen? Let&#39;s go back in time to
the middle of the twentieth century. The Nazi regime in Germany revealed to
the world how bigotry, intolerance, racism and super-nationalism can grow into
a grotesque, violent, terrifying political machine of ostracism, slavery and
extermination. In Hitler&#39;s Germany, homosexuals were forced to wear a pink
triangle on their clothes, and were sent to concentration camps, along with Jews,
Communists, disabled people and gypsies. I&#39;m sorry to say that the Nazis are
not the first and last people in the world to be bigoted, intolerant and
racist. </p>
<p>When American
fighting men came back home from World War II, blacks went back to the segregated
South, Jews were excluded from social clubs, and not long afterward Senator Joe
McCarthy and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover took on Communists and homosexuals.
The police in many large cities entrapped men in bathrooms by propositioning
them and immediately arresting them if they responded. The usual punishment
was not jail, but notification of the employer and public humiliation. Alan
Turing, a mathematical genius who had cracked the Nazi&#39;s submarine code, was
arrested, tried and convicted under Britain&#39;s Anti-Homosexual Statutes in
1952. He committed suicide in the summer of 1954 by taking a bite of a
cyanide-laced apple in his laboratory. </p>
<p>What do people do
when they&#39;re living a life of harassment and persecution? They look for a
place to go where they&#39;ll be accepted, cared for and left alone. Thus ghettos
form, even without state decree. After the war, people who were ostracized and
harassed back in their hometowns began to seek the anonymity of big cities. A
gay community sprang up in Greenwich Village in New York. Another developed as
a summer vacation spot on Fire Island. In the &#39;60s, it was illegal to serve
openly gay men at a bar. Radical gay power and liberation was launched with
the Stonewall Inn Riot, the last weekend of June 1969, when a gay bar was
raided by the NYPD and drag queens fought back. </p>
<p>However, the apogee
of political success for gays was achieved not in New York but in San
Francisco. Harvey Milk was elected as a supervisor, the first openly gay
elected official in the nation. And some of you may have seen the recent
movie, the film that was named <i>Milk</i>, which is about his story. In 1978,
right in City Hall, Harvey Milk and the liberal mayor, George Moscone, were
shot by another member of the Board of Supervisors, the anti-gay politician Dan
White. Instantly, Harvey Milk became a martyr, galvanizing gay solidarity. </p>
<p>By 1980, the then
governor of California, Edmund Brown, declared the last week in June Gay
Freedom Week. This is the week of Gay Freedom Day parades all over the world,
commemorating the Stonewall Riot. As a result, San Francisco became a Mecca
for gay people who streamed there in great numbers. I quote Randy Shilts in <i>And
the Band Played On</i>: </p>
<p>&quot;The promise of
freedom had fueled the greatest exodus of immigrants to San Francisco since the
Gold Rush. Between 1969 and 1973, at least 9,000 gay men moved to San
Francisco, followed by 20,000 between 1974 and 1978. By 1980, about 5,000
homosexual men were moving to the Golden Gate every year. The immigration now
made for a city in which two in five adult males were openly gay.&quot; </p>
<p>This group was very politically coherent.
They were thrilled to come out of the closet and participate openly. Gay
people started their own churches and choirs. As a result, local charities,
like the Red Cross, were happy to exploit their civic mindedness. In 1980,
five to seven percent of the donated blood in San Francisco was given by gay
men who did not know that they were HIV-positive. Of course, immigrant groups
always have their seamier side of organized crime and commercial sex. Gay men,
in particular, were accustomed to covert and anonymous expression of their
sexuality, and participation in the bathhouse culture was more mainstream for
them. Remember, many of these young men had been repressing and hiding their
sexuality for most of their lives, and when society denies people healthy ways
of expressing their sexuality, all kinds of strange things begin to happen.
Many of the strange things that happened in the bathhouses are perfect methods
of transmitting every kind of infection; especially Hepatitis B, giardia,
salmonella, and something brand new, HIV. </p>
<p>And if you don&#39;t know
what the bathhouses are, I would recommend that you read Randy Shilt&#39;s book and
find out. So, this is the background of AIDS: globalization, modern invasive
medical technology, and ghettoizing of gay people. Okay, let&#39;s return to 1981
and the first report in the medical literature, that you all have in your
hands. Western doctors who read it were oblivious to the fact that while
everyone was celebrating the World Health Organization&#39;s successful program to
eradicate smallpox in 1978, a stealthy brand new germ had spread from Central
Africa, via professionals who had worked there, to both Haiti and Europe. It
had been introduced to centers of commercialized gay sex, once it had spread
into the blood banks and hospitals of every nation, into intravenous drug users
and into their partners and babies. </p>
<p>Of course, when the
first horrible deaths from weird infections occurred in the late &#39;70s and early
&#39;80s, doctors had no idea that the cause of this mysterious immunological
deficiency was a retrovirus, that it was a slow virus and had been contracted
up to ten years before. The first characteristic of the disease observant
doctors noticed was its typical STD pattern. It affected exactly the same
high-risk groups that syphilis and Hepatitis B affect: gay men, prostitutes of
both sexes, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs. This epidemiological pattern
caused instant recognition in the minds of the knowledgeable. They immediately
knew that this was an infectious disease caused by a virus and bodily fluids.
That&#39;s why the first reports submitted in 1981 were published immediately in
the MMWR. </p>
<p>Take another look at
the paper yourselves. Imagine reading it and instantly predicting the awful
future. Luckily for all of us, Dr. Don Francis, the man in the sweater, did
just that. He was a thirty-eight-year-old epidemiologist who was at the time
working with the gay community on developing a Hepatitis B vaccine. His Ph.D.
project and lab work had been on retroviruses. On hearing about these two
reports, he instantly put two and two together, to predict that this was a
virus responsible for immunosuppressant and to predisposing to cancers, as well
as opportunistic infections. Why, just the year before, in 1980, Dr. Robert
Gallo of the National Cancer Institute had shown that a retrovirus he called
HTLV caused a type of leukemia common in Japan. It was contagious and had a frighteningly
long incubation period. </p>
<p>Dr. Francis at the
CDC understood immediately, in 1981, what sort of a disaster was in the making,
and so right away he began trying to move heaven and earth, to get money for
research for virus labs to isolate the virus and get a diagnostic test. But
his pleas fell mostly on deaf ears. A few did eventually pay attention to him,
luckily, and a year later Dr. Gallo, at the NCI was finally convinced that Dr.
Francis was right, and dedicated a portion of his lab to the research. </p>
<p>Meanwhile in France,
Professor Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute, and in San Francisco Jay
Levy, were also working on trying to isolate the virus. The French isolated it
first, and soon afterwards applied to the Patent Office in the United States
for blood tests. Gallo&#39;s lab announced in 1884 that they had discovered the
AIDS infectious agent, applied also for a patent, and tried to take all the
credit for the discovery. This led to an unpleasant and embarrassing squabble
between France and the U.S. We always seem to be getting into little squabbles
with them. Finally after lawsuits, congressional investigations and public
apologies, everyone agreed on a way to share. A settlement negotiated in 1987
named Montagnier and Gallo as co-discoverers, and divided the royalties from
the blood test between an AIDS foundation, the NIH and the Pasteur Institute. </p>
<p>The 2008 Nobel Prize
in Medicine went to Dr. Montagnier for his discovery. As you can see, it is he
who is smiling, not Dr. Gallo. Montagnier&#39;s and Gallo&#39;s efforts had produced a
diagnostic, at least a blood test, by 1984. This had enormous implications, of
course, for the blood banking industry. It also meant that populations could
be screened to find out who was infected. Naturally, epidemiologists wanted to
screen the high-risk populations to find out the actual extent of the
epidemic. They wanted to do what epidemiologists always do; try to contain the
disaster by identifying carriers and their contacts, and by preventing the
spread of the infection. Unfortunately, they knew that trying to work with the
two high-risk groups, MSMs--that&#39;s men who have sex with men--and IVDUs was not
going to be easy. </p>
<p>As an example, gay Gaëtan Dugas, the
Canadian airline steward who is known as Patient Zero, estimated he had
approximately 250 sexual partners per year, and carried on like that for longer
than ten years. Busy guy. The hotline at the Kaposi&#39;s Sarcoma Foundation
began receiving repeated calls from people who had had sex in a sex parlor with
a Frenchman, and he then calmly told them that he had gay cancer, or Kaposi&#39;s
sarcoma. This is Gaëtan Dugas. And this
is what one of the signs of Kaposi&#39;s sarcoma. As a result, a director of the
San Francisco Public Health Department had to confront him of the consequences
of his behavior. His pithy response to her was, &quot;It&#39;s none of your
god-damned business. It&#39;s my right to do what I want to do with my own
body.&quot; If I was totally cool, I would say that with a French accent, but
I&#39;m not. </p>
<p>Next, the exact
mechanisms of pathogenesis were worked out. HIV was shown to be transmitted by
sexual contract from exposure to infected blood, or from an infected mother to
her fetus or breastfed infant; although the paranoid public thought that you
could get it from doorknobs and toilet seats. Once the virus gained access to
the new host, it would target lymphocytes in the blood with the CD4 surface
molecule. After gaining entry to these important cells in the immune system,
since the virus is cytopathic and cell killing it would replicate, kill the
cell, and release into the bloodstream, causing a viremia of billions of
particles. </p>
<p>Researchers
discovered that they could follow the course of the disease by counting CD4
cells. More recently, the ability to measure viral loads directly has also
become possible, and so this is presently a routine means of monitoring the
course of disease and impactive treatments. In healthy people, CD4 counts are
over 500 cells per millimeter cubed, and when the count drops under 200 the
person experiences significant immunodeficiency, so that their body cannot
fight off opportunistic infections like TB, pneumocystis pneumonia--or PCP as
it&#39;s called--toxoplasmosis and cryptococcal meningitis. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s a chart
showing the most common presenting complaints in a Haitian clinic, leading to a
diagnosis of AIDS. You can see that fifty-four percent presented with TB.
Sorry, yes, extra pulmonary and pulmonary TB. Ten percent were diagnosed as
part of pregnancy screening. And the third largest group had what was called
&quot;slim disease&quot;; which is basically wasting away. Once the
pathogenesis was understood, strategies for treatment could be developed. This
has consisted of three prongs of attack: 1, Aggressive treatment and prevention
of the opportunistic infections that ravaged the bodies of immuno-compromised
people; 2, antiretrovirals, and more recently, protease inhibitors. That&#39;s
lots of pills. </p>
<p>The invention of
antiretroviral agents began with AZT, introduced in 1987. Since then, more
than fourteen have been approved by the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration,
which is incredibly fast approval. Usually the FDA is very slow and deliberate
about approving new drugs. However, because of intense pressure from gay
activists, like ACT UP, the rules were changed for AIDS medications. In 1994,
the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial Group protocols showed that AZT, taken during
pregnancy, could significantly reduce the vertical transmission of HIV from
mother to baby. There&#39;s also firm evidence now that drugs given after
exposure, for medical workers, rape victims, or other unprotected sex, offers a
good hope of prevention. This is called post-exposure prophylaxis. And the
most recent discovery is that circumcision offers some protection to men. </p>
<p>In the space of seven
years, from the first reported cases in 1981 of agonizing deaths in young gay
men, the scientific medical establishment was able to unravel the mystery of
the disease and start treating it. However, because of globalization, and
because of cultural attitudes towards sex--that we&#39;ll talk about--HIV/AIDS had
already spread around the entire world, within those seven years, and was
decimating Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Since 1987,
tremendous strides have been made in wealthy countries in treating the disease
with complicated and expensive multiple drug regimens. Recommendations from a
CDC panel in 2002 state: &quot;Antiretroviral regimens are complex, have
serious side effects, pose difficulty with adherence, and carry serious
potential consequences from the development of viral resistance because of
non-adherence to the drug regimen, or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral
agents. Haitian involvement in therapeutic decisions is critical.&quot; It&#39;s
a full-time job, being HIV-positive, just keeping track of your medications.
These treatments cost well over fifteen hundred dollars a month, and turn AIDS
into a chronic illness.</p>
<p>Most of the people in
the world, however, are too poor to have access to these expensive drugs and
complex healthcare interactions. The majority of people with AIDS waste away,
and die, between the ages of twenty-five and forty-four, without the benefit of
any medical care. Despite millions of dollars, and years of trying, all
attempts at developing a vaccine have been dismal failures so far. But this is
basically an STD, isn&#39;t it? What about prevention? We all know that STDs are
potentially preventable. So, why wasn&#39;t something done at the beginning of the
epidemic? Why did the world wait around for science to be worked out before
going into action to do something about the disaster?</p>
<p>You can bet that all
smart medical personnel, like this lovely nurse, instantly put on gloves, gowns
and masks, and instituted universal precautions; which is the modern day
quarantine. Why didn&#39;t everybody else put on their condoms? Our culture
greeted the news of this frightening new disease with the same old
counterproductive reactions of the past--scapegoating, mass hysteria--and the
public was given a front row seat by modern mass media to the confrontation
between the Religious Right, led by people like Reverend Jerry Falwell and his
Moral Majority, and organized gays like ACT UP. It was even more exciting than
professional wrestling. When the media and the public realized, however, that
unsuspecting patients were being infected by the blood supply, people with AIDS
were ostracized. </p>
<p>Hemophiliac children
were prevented from attending school. Haitian immigrants were excluded from
the country. People were afraid to donate blood. They associated walking into
a blood bank with catching the disease. But when Rock Hudson, a movie star
icon of male charisma at the time, announced he had AIDS, and died of it in
1985, the American media and its adoring public finally decided we&#39;d better get
serious about all of this. Old religious ideas about sexuality took on fresh
meaning. Suddenly everyone began talking about celibacy, monogamy and
abstinence. The sixties and seventies had been a time of liberalization of old
sexual mores in Western civilizations. With the invention of the birth
control pill, legalized abortion and effective treatments for STDs, many
religious fundamentalists had been very unhappy. Now they could climb into
their pulpits and preach fire and brimstone. </p>
<p>Jerry Falwell, a
Baptist minister pronounced: &quot;AIDS is not just God&#39;s punishment for
homosexuals, it is God&#39;s punishment for the society that tolerates
homosexuals.&quot; The Roman Catholic Church, ruled by the Pope from the Holy
See at the Vatican as an absolute monarch, made a response through its Global
Government of Bishops and Parish Priests. The Catholic Church also condemned
homosexuality. And since the Catholic Church is opposed to all birth control,
the use of condoms was also condemned.</p>
<p>Now, the gay
community has a particular interest in the Catholic Church. They suspect that
many who have taken a vow of celibacy may actually be closet homosexuals. As a
result, a decision was made by the gay community to hold their annual World
Pride Celebration in Rome in the Year 2000. This was especially maddening
because the late Pope John Paul II and the Vatican had mobilized tremendous
resources to celebrate the 2000 Years of Christianity, the Jubilee. The church
tried pressuring the Italian government to remove its support for the Gay Pride
demonstration. </p>
<p>The pope appeared to
make the following statement: &quot;In the name of the Church of Rome, I must
express sadness for the affront to the Grand Jubilee of the Year 2000, and for
the offense to the Christian values of the city that is so dear to the hearts
of the Catholics of the world. Homosexual acts are against Nature&#39;s laws. The
church cannot silence the truth, because this would not help discern what is
good from what is evil.&quot; Before AIDS emerged in the United States, right-wing
religious groups had organized politically around anti-abortion agendas. This
group, which uses the buzzwords &quot;right to life&quot; and &quot;family values,&quot; was
already up and running, with big clout on the Republican Party&#39;s platform.
They had helped to elect the conservative California governor, President Ronald
Reagan in 1980. He was in the White House, busy slashing the healthcare budget
when the AIDS tragedy unfolded. A disease of gay men and drug users was not a
priority for him. </p>
<p>At a time that called
for strong leadership to contain a major emerging epidemic, our president chose
to remain oblivious to the insistent demands of the CDC and gay rights groups
to be proactive about preventing the spread of suffering. In addition, he had
instituted the gag rule, which effectively defunded the United Nations
Population Fund, the largest backer in the world of women&#39;s reproductive health,
the clinics where poor people get condoms. When President Reagan nominated Dr.
C. Everett Koop to be his surgeon general, feminists, gays and pro-choice
groups were worried because this pediatric surgeon from Philadelphia had a
reputation for an anti-choice agenda. Finally, five years into the epidemic,
President Reagan responded to mounting pressure by asking Dr. Koop to prepare a
report on AIDS. </p>
<p>Dr. Koop is a great
guy. He&#39;s a good, hard-working doctor, and he got busy for the next nine
months doing a thorough and honest job investigating the epidemic. He ended up
writing a lot of the report by himself. To the medical profession&#39;s delight,
the report was explicit, non-judgmental, controversial and popular. It
contributed significantly to providing accurate, comprehensive information to
the public. Koop also personally penned &quot;Understanding AIDS,&quot; the
public health brochure. He made the decision to send the brochure to all 107
million U.S. households in 1988, the largest public health mailing ever. And
rumor had it at the time that President Reagan didn&#39;t find out about it until
after--after he got his in the mail, I guess. </p>
<p>Aside from Dr. Koop,
however, the Reagan administration had two political agendas that could not
have been more inimical to containing the epidemic. The statistics speak for
themselves. Instead of providing more funding to the government&#39;s health
agencies to deal with the problem, the administration was slashing budgets. In
addition, they blocked efforts of sex educators worldwide, around STD
prevention, the so-called gag rule. The large groups of people who believe in
preventive medicine began lobbying hard for good sex education and PR for
condom use. But Republicans and the religious right have consistently tried to
block providing this education in public schools and on TV, while legislating
abstinence-only education, to which billions of dollars have been given. </p>
<p>The gay community, of
course, educated themselves about safer sex, but they blocked the closing down
of the bathhouses for an unconscionable amount of time. Another preventive
strategy that can tremendously slow the spread of HIV is needle exchange
programs. IVDUs--intravenous drug users--reuse dirty needles. In countries
that provide sterile needles in exchange for dirty ones, the spread of disease
among this group slows dramatically. However, in the United States, these
programs have been blocked by the religious right. One of the most
depressingly shortsighted responses to the epidemic was that of the blood
banking industry. The Food and Drug Administration is the federal agency that
regulates them, but politics prevented them from doing the right thing. </p>
<p>Dr. Don Francis and
the CDC were desperately trying to convince the FDA, the Red Cross, the
American Association of Blood Banks, the National Hemophilia Foundation, to
institute screening of blood for Hepatitis B, even before the blood test for
HIV had been invented. Because gay men had cooperated in the research for a
vaccine against Hepatitis B, it was clear to everyone that the same people at
risk for one disease were at risk for the other. But the gay groups were
absolutely paranoid about screening of any kind. They feared the stigma of
positive blood tests would affect their--would make them lose their job and
their insurance, and the blood banking industry was very happy to go along with
the gay lobby because it would be so expensive and such a big deal for them to
screen the blood. Therefore, even though Don Francis was openly accusing them
of negligent homicide, the Red Cross did nothing until 1985, when the screening
test for HIV became available. Prior to this, babies needing transfusions,
grandmothers needing hip replacements, hemophiliacs, their wives, and many
others had died premature, prolonged and painful deaths, from the contaminated
blood supply. </p>
<p>Once blood testing
became routine, politically organized gay groups successively got irrationally
stringent confidentiality laws passed around the screening test, and those
regulations have had a negative impact on collecting accurate statistics ever
since. Luckily, not all reactions to the AIDS crisis were based on
intolerance, political expediency, financial shortsightedness and
self-interest. Many nurses, doctors, families and friends of victims,
ministers and rabbis, rallied around to provide support, to organize
fundraising, to apply political pressure, and countless acts of compassion and
charity. </p>
<p>A heartrending and
beautiful reminder of this is the AIDS Quilt, which is part of the Names
Project. Their stated goals are to provide a creative means for remembrance
and healing; to illustrate the enormity of the AIDS epidemic; to increase
public awareness of AIDS; to assist with HIV prevention education; and to raise
funds for community-based AIDS service organizations. Anyone can commemorate
someone who died of AIDS by making a panel of the quilt, which is the size of a
gravestone, three feet by six feet, with the name, the dates, and any
memorabilia on it. A documentary about the project called <i>Common Threads</i>
won an Academy Award in 1990 and is available for you to watch. In October of
1996, the AIDS Quilt was unfurled in Washington, DC. It was a mile long,
extending from the Washington Monument to Capitol Hill. I just want to say
it&#39;s a little different living through an epidemic than reading about it. </p>
<p>Many thoughtful
religious people were jolted into reexamining their proper role in this crisis,
with regards to human sexuality and health. The Episcopal Bishop of Newark,
New Jersey, John Shelby Spong, became famous with the press in the 1980s
because of his active role in ordaining gay priests, and his work against
homophobia. He, along with others, formed a taskforce on changing patterns in
sexuality and family life, to examine changes in modern society, and to make
recommendations for study for the National Episcopal Convention in 1987. The
taskforce recommended, in relation to premarital sexual activity, &quot;that
all relationships are to be assessed in terms of their capacity to manifest
marks of the realm of God; healing, reconciliation, compassion, mutuality and
concern for others, both within and beyond one&#39;s immediate circle of
intimacy.&quot; With regard to issues of committed homosexual relationships,
the report suggested that &quot;ideally homosexual couples would find within
the community of the faithful, the congregation, the same recognition and
affirmation which nurtures and sustains heterosexual couples and their
relationships; including, where appropriate, liturgies which recognize and
bless such relationships.&quot; </p>
<p>Many religious people
were eager to become a source of encouragement and healing, instead of guilt
and shame, for the myriad of people who do not fit into narrowly defined,
unrealistic sexual roles. Reactions to the AIDS epidemic has caused ongoing
struggles within traditional religions around the issue of gay relationships
and premarital sex education, and this continued into the new millennium.
Three days after the tragedy of 9/11, the Reverend Jerry Falwell pronounced on
the 700 Club, the Christian TV show: &quot;I really believe that the pagans and
the abortionists, and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians that are
actively trying to make an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the
American Way, all of them, who have tried to secularize America, I point the
finger in their face and say, &#39;You helped this happen.&#39;&quot; </p>
<p>CNN sat up and took
notice of this, and gave the executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian
Taskforce an opportunity to respond. She answered by saying, &quot;The
terrible tragedy that has befallen our nation, and indeed the entire global
community, is the sad byproduct of fanaticism. It has its roots in the same
fanaticism that enables people like Jerry Falwell to preach hate against those
who do not think, live, or love in the exact same way he does. The tragedies that
have occurred this week did not occur because someone made God mad, as Dr.
Falwell asserts. They occurred because of hate, pure and simple. It&#39;s time to
move beyond a place of hate and to a place of healing. We hope that Mr.
Falwell will apologize to the U.S. and world communities.&quot; </p>
<p>The sad fact is that
any one of us can get AIDS, in the same way that anyone can be the victim of a
terrorist. You don&#39;t have to do anything to deserve it. All you have to do is
be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Whether we like it or not, in this
twenty-first century, we are one overgrown human family of more than 6.7
billion individuals, packed into a global village. The thirty-three million
among us who live with HIV/AIDS are a huge reservoir for all sorts of
opportunistic infections, because of immune compromise. As a result, syphilis
and TB have made a comeback. Multiple-drug-resistant TB is becoming a growing
problem. </p>
<p>At present, our best
hopes for prevention of HIV/AIDS in the future lies in unfettering the gags on
the sex education community; providing condoms; supporting and promoting
monogamy, regardless of sexual preference; needle exchange programs; universal
access to family planning and prenatal care; and in funding viral research.
Wherever the next killer epidemic starts, like AIDS did in Africa, it won&#39;t
take long to infect the whole earth if governments insist on playing politics
with the medical profession and public health institutions. </p>
<p>Evidence-based
medicine, not religious revelation, should be the basis of decision making when
it comes to containing epidemics. Our future relies on clever, energetic young
people, like yourselves, deciding that you&#39;re not afraid of the hard work and
complicated, unpopular truths that are an integral part of maintaining public
health. Here&#39;s a list of questions to get you started thinking and talking
about sexually transmitted diseases and public policy. And I think you&#39;re
going to email that to them, right? So, you don&#39;t have to copy it down. Good
luck. </p>
