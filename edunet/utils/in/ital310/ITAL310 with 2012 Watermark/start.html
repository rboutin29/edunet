            <h3>About the Course</h3>
            <p>The course is an introduction to Dante and his cultural milieu through a critical reading of the Divine Comedy and selected minor works (<em>Vita nuova, Convivio, De vulgari eloquentia, Epistle to Cangrande</em>). An analysis of Dante's autobiography, the <em>Vita nuova</em>, establishes the poetic and political circumstances of the Comedy's composition. Readings of <em>Inferno</em>, <em>Purgatory</em> and <em>Paradise</em> seek to situate Dante's work within the intellectual and social context of the late Middle Ages, with special attention paid to political, philosophical and theological concerns. Topics in the <em>Divine Comedy</em> explored over the course of the semester include the relationship between ethics and aesthetics; love and knowledge; and exile and history.   <a href="content/sessions.html">view class sessions &gt;&gt;</a></p>
